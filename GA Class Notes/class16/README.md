## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

1. Build feed-forward neural networks using TensorFlow Keras
2. Understand the differences in the final layer for regression, binary classification, and multi-class classification NN models


## Lesson Outline

### Tensorboard Playground
In Tensorboard Playground, using the presets [here](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=relu&batchSize=16&dataset=spiral&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=&seed=0.61886&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=80&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) 
try to bring the test set loss under .01 by changing only the number of layers and the number of neurons.

If you get succeed, try to find the mininum number of neurons and layers that solve the problem. How many epochs does it take?

If you solve that problem, try adding some noise.


### Neural Nets with Keras 
- Create a regression model in `keras`
- Create a binary classification model in `keras`
- Create a multi-class classification model in `keras`
