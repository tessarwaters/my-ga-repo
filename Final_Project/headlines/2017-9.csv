In the wake of Munnu’s 2012 death at age 54 from brain cancer, his 33-year-old son, who friends call Sid, has emerged in his own right as a designer — and bon vivant. Munnu brought Indian fine jewelry the international recognition once reserved for European houses and championed previously unsung stones like the spinel; his son, who opened a vivid new Mumbai boutique in 2015, aims to further marry historical influences with contemporary settings in his work. Good-naturedly dodging his mother’s entreaties to settle down, the peripatetic and engaging Kasliwal scours the world for outrageous gems (a recent find was an old 10-carat mine diamond at a Las Vegas antiques show) and the best parties. When not on the road or in India, he can be found in his Upper East Side Manhattan atelier, entertaining clients in the scarlet-upholstered suite of a townhouse, surrounded by velvet-lined trays of glittering adornments. ‘‘I was raised for this,’’ he says. ‘‘It’s the best life you can imagine.’’"

The DACA ‘Fix’ That Immigration Activists Fear,2017-09-06,article,News,,"['Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals', 'Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Minors Act)']","By upending Obama’s executive order, Trump is likely to reopen fault lines in a beleaguered movement.","When news leaked on Monday that President Trump had decided to dismantle Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — the 2012 policy that granted administrative relief to some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors — some commentators tried to find a ray of hope in the dismal forecast. Trump, they noted, would give Congress six months to save the DACA-protected “Dreamers” from deportation with a legislative fix. Never mind that House Republicans sabotaged a chance to help Dreamers in 2013, when John Boehner, the House speaker, refused to hold a vote on an immigration-reform bill that had passed in the Senate to a vote on the House floor. Now, NPR reported, Republicans might favor a bill introduced by Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida that would give Dreamers a path to citizenship. “Overwhelmingly, Republicans tell me: ‘Yes, I could support giving these young immigrants permanent status in our country,’ ” Curbelo told “All Things Considered,” “ ‘as long as we continue moving towards better border security, the enforcement of our immigration laws.’ ” Yet among the undocumented activists whom I got to know while reporting in Arizona earlier this year, such a compromise is hardly viewed with relief. Rather it is the Catch-22 that they have been dreading ever since Trump was elected."

If you’ve watched any of Ms. Meyers’s movies, the resemblance between influence and imitation will be readily apparent. To wit: A star (Reese Witherspoon) plays a would-be charmer (here called Alice) whose neuroses are as fabulously customized as her kitchen. She’s what the brand-conscious call a creative, and while she works (a bit), she spends much of her time on man troubles. Her life is as fluffed as a throw pillow and so drained of realism it is best described as a lifestyle, which can make for a killer aspirational fantasy, at least in Nancy Meyers’s hands."

But the quibbling misses an important concern about what it means to argue for a female-only canon. The power of the list came, in part, from its mere existence, from how necessary it felt. Behold the many artists ignored by mainstream coed lists! Aaliyah! Shakira! Tori Amos! Chaka Khan! Why would albums by women who rank so prominently on a list determined by women be missing from one determined by all genders but really mostly men? The question matters. This week we talk about why it does.

Still Lives That Won’t Hold Still,2017-09-07,article,News,,['Photography'],Maria Cosindas’s dreamlike photographs have a magic all their own.,"Marie Cosindas, who was born in Boston in September 1923 and who died in the same city in May of this year at age 93, made photographs of such potency that they seem magical, dependent on something beyond mere sleight of hand for their mesmerizing effects and unified mood, so that the experience of looking at a selection of them is like watching a single sentence unfurl over several pages, driven along by an invisible inner consistency, not unlike the atmosphere of imaginative abundance that Gabriel García Márquez evoked in his novel “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” an atmosphere he used as the backdrop for the dense saga of the Buendía family in the mythical town of Macondo, and especially in his account of the magician Melquíades, a “heavy Gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands,” a bearer of dazzling and arcane knowledge, including visions of the present and the future, as well as the secrets of optics, telescopes and magnetism, so that many different kinds of insight seem to find a natural unity inside him, and whose work re-emerges in the final pages of the novel in Sanskrit parchments, with “the even lines in the private cipher of the Emperor Augustus and the odd ones in a Lacedaemonian military code,” the inscrutabilities layered on one another to arrive at a startling lucidity of the kind that might be experienced by someone whose tangled dreams, regardless of their wildness or relentlessness, give way to a pure vision of wakefulness, though not the uninflected wakefulness of one who rises in early morning to a hot and innocent white light but rather the shadowed knowingness of one who has slept all day and awakes to the infinitesimally graded colors of a deepening evening, a moodiness recognizable to any viewer of Cosindas’s photographs, which make the most of small, dark spaces, a talent that perhaps originated in her being the eighth of 10 children raised by Greek immigrant parents in a small apartment in Boston’s South End, just as her experience as a child attending her parents’ Greek Orthodox church, with its gilded Byzantine icons and busy walls, was possibly the origin of her luminous sense of color and the suggestion of incense even when there is no smoke to be seen, a dimension of her work which certainly did not arrive instantaneously, though it did finally arrive, after she had worked as a painter and also as a photographer in black and white, including time spent in the workshop of Ansel Adams, whose grayscale lessons she abandoned in order to take up color with an alchemical force that is reminiscent of the great Amsterdam painter Rachel Ruysch, a widely celebrated artist in the very first rank of still-life painters of the Dutch golden age, who was active from the final quarter of the 17th century until shortly before her death in 1750 at age 86, and who, moreover, was one of very few women to be feted in that profession, and who outgrew both her botanist father and painter husband, outshining them in reputation as she consolidated both botanical and artistic knowledge, while raising 10 children, to produce ferociously accurate bouquets of flowers, some of which were literal works of fiction that showed in a single vase blooms that would have been seen in life only in different seasons but which through the magical art of painting could permanently be brought together, each precisely painted and often accompanied by equally fine depictions of marble plinths, tabletops, vases and insects, the entire arrangement set against a dark background, as was the vogue during the maturity of Dutch floral painting, a branch of art that was the elevation of the most modest and domestic material into an intensity that approached the sublime, a gift given to only a few: to leverage the ordinary into the glorious, to turn the soft petals of flowers into a flamelike radiance,"

Review: The Crime Drama ‘True to the Game’ Lacks Finesse,2017-09-07,article,Review,,['Movies'],A drug lord finds love and tries to exit his way of life in this movie based on the Teri Woods novel.," “True to the Game” presents a Philadelphia parable. Gena (Erica Peeples) is an aspiring writer, Quadir (Columbus Short) is a cocaine kingpin. Their love promises a new beginning, but there may be no way to exit a life on the streets. Based on the Teri Woods novel of the same name, the hustlers of “True to the Game” are trapped in a world of twists and treachery. But though Ms. Woods’s novel was a resonant entry in the crime genre when it came out nearly 20 years ago, this adaptation lacks the vision to find a fresh angle on her story. It’s all too easy to guess which characters will be marked for tragedy and which characters will learn from their loss."

They drove themselves to excel in an unfamiliar environment. But at what cost?,"The road to Virginia Episcopal School was more secluded in those days, winding a few miles from the white section of segregated Lynchburg through a wood of maple and oak to the school’s rolling campus, shielded by trees and the more distant Blue Ridge Mountains. The usual stream of cars navigated the bends on the first day of school, white families ferrying their adolescent sons. Like nearly every other elite prep school in the South, it had been the boarding school’s tradition since its founding in 1916 that its teachers guide white boys toward its ideal of manhood — erudite, religious, resilient. But that afternoon of Sept. 8, 1967, a taxi pulled up the long driveway carrying a black teenager, Marvin Barnard. He had journeyed across the state, 120 miles by bus, from the black side of Richmond, unaccompanied, toting a single suitcase. In all of Virginia, a state whose lawmakers had responded to the 1954 court-ordered desegregation of public schools with a strategy of declared “massive resistance,” no black child had ever enrolled in a private boarding school. When Marvin stepped foot on V.E.S. ground, wearing a lightweight sport jacket, a white dress shirt, a modest necktie and a cap like the ones the Beatles were wearing, the white idyll was over."

This was not so long ago, and yet the world back then was still so unmapped: A traveler could and did wander through it like Pausanias, like Ibn Battuta, like the explorers who wrote the first drafts of the romance of movement, of the twinned danger and delight of finding oneself in a place where one was at the mercy of unfriendly but intriguing strangers. A traveler, back then, was far less likely to find in the foreign traces of the familiar. Depending on where he ventured, he had significantly fewer guarantees of safety, and equally thrillingly, only limited ways of communicating with those he knew and had left behind. And it wasn’t only that you could (and, indeed, would) travel as Ibn Battuta had, but, crucially, you could travel where Ibn Battuta had, as well: Sanaa and Baghdad and Damascus, all of which are now treacherous or off-­limits, cities in countries forced by war or disaster or bad governance to deny their cultures’ extravagant senses of hospitality."

It wasn’t from the nonstop news coverage on CNN and elsewhere; it was from the transmissions that lay behind it, in the pulses of information coming down from space. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, crucial tools for monitoring big storms in the Gulf of Mexico, were capturing cloud formations, surface temperatures and barometric pressures, which were then fed into computer models tracking the storm’s strength and intensity. At the same time, NASA was using a group of satellites to keep tabs on soil moisture, flood patterns and power failures all over East Texas. In various ways, this torrent of data was being collected continuously from hundreds (or even thousands) of miles overhead, through radar instruments and spectroradiometer sensors and exquisitely calibrated imaging cameras. The machines being used aren’t household names — they go by acronyms like GOES-13, Modis and SMAP — but they demonstrate why the popular view of Earth as a big blue planet with only the Moon as its companion could do with some revising. We are also surrounded by a constellation of satellites spinning elliptical webs of environmental observation, day and night."

Alice Waters’s Grilled Cheese Is Not Like Yours and Mine,2017-09-15,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"In her best-selling new memoir, “Coming to My Senses,” the chef recommends a French mountain cheese and homemade sauerkraut for a childhood staple.","LUNCH MENU: The chef and restaurateur Alice Waters’s new memoir, “Coming to My Senses,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 13, and for all of its frank talk about free love and hard drinking, its most scandalous revelation may be that when Waters was in grade school in suburban New Jersey, she used to trade her peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches for bologna and cheese on white bread. Alice Waters? The owner of Chez Panisse and generalissimo of the organic food revolution? Back then, she happily admits, her favorite lunch was grilled cheese with pickles and maybe an orange soda, if she could sneak out to a local dinette. “I think of grilled cheese sandwiches as one of the great comfort foods,” she writes, before snapping out of it to become the Waters we all recognize: “These days I make them with a Cantal, a mountain cheese from France that’s a little like a Swiss — I like my cheese to be a bit tangy. I usually choose some good whole wheat or levain bread from Acme Bread Company. I slice the cheese and put it inside the bread, put some olive oil in a cast iron pan — not too much! — drizzle oil on the top of the sandwich, and then weight it down with another cast iron pan. When it gets really brown, I turn it over, and when the cheese starts to bubble out the sides, I take it out. Then I rub both sides with half a clove of garlic and serve it with a dill pickle or some sauerkraut (good homemade sauerkraut, not the kraut out of the can that I never liked as a child!). Or I’ll have a little undressed salad on the side — the melted cheese and the olive oil from the sandwich almost dress the lettuce. Sometimes in the summer I’ll put some hot peppers in.” All right, that does sound pretty good. But it’s probably for the best that Chez Panisse never established a children’s menu. I’d hate to see what Waters does to chicken fingers."

T Magazine Editors on Things They’re Into Right Now,2017-09-15,article,News,,"['Art', 'Fashion and Apparel']",A not-exhaustive list of what's on our radar.,"Fashion collaborations can feel like calculated mismatches meant to surprise you with their own improbability. Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos have taken the opposite approach, filling a pop-up shop in a South Kensington, London townhouse with design pieces by people they already love and collect: their friends. It’s an impressive group that includes Martino Gamper, famous for his 3D drawing project “100 Chairs in 100 Days,” whose button-top stools figure in the space, and his wife, the sculptor Francis Upritchard, who helped choose a vibrant orange for the walls. The shade reminded Pilotto and de Vos of houses they’d seen on a recent trip to Lima, Peru (“we’re currently in a South America phase,” Pilotto says). Elsewhere is a hand-knotted rug with a painterly diamond motif from Ecuador, an actual painting by Peter McDonald and a bench that the designer Bethan Laura Wood covered with a rainbow-hued patchwork textile. It’s a perfect complement to the brand’s latest ready-to-wear collection, which Pilotto describes as “tropical-baroque” and includes quilted microfiber jackets and an asymmetrical dress embroidered with chenille yarn. One day, he and de Vos were in the studio of the glassblower Jochen Holz and found themselves drawn to a series of glass coat hooks Holz had made, which Holz has now remade for them as a series of sculptural glass-drop earrings and cuffs. “It was about playing with different materials and seeing what we could do,” says Pilotto. “And just such a natural dialogue between disciplines.” Fittingly, the shop will stay open through fashion week, the London Design Festival and Frieze. 3 Cromwell Pl., London — KATE GUADAGNINO "

One researcher told her: “If you are looking for it all to be logical and fall into place perfectly, it isn’t going to yet.” “Survivor Café” grapples with big and possibly unanswerable questions about how we recognize and cope with the traumas we inherit, and how we can properly keep alive the personal stories behind great historical atrocities even after everyone who lived through them is gone. “I am more afraid of forgetting my parents’ stories than I am of forgetting my own,” Rosner writes.

For her spring 2018 collection, shown in London last weekend, Margaret Howell presented a characteristically minimal A-line skirt in a black and white cotton silk check that reminded me of starched schoolgirl uniforms, golden September days in New England and the tea-length hemlines of the late 1930s and 1940s that feel spot-on today. Howell’s design will be available with the first buds of spring, but for a tartan fix now, here are a few appealing autumnal options."

She spent two days just wandering the grounds, where contemporary sculptures (a monumental steel chair covered in antlers, a tiny wood house in a clearing) by the likes of Marina Abramovic, Robert Wilson and Maya Lin stand amid tall beech trees and, in some cases, grazing cows. (The art foundation shares the land with a working dairy farm.) Deep in the woods, Holzer found herself thinking of ‘‘fairy tales light and dark.’’ Then she came upon a waist-high stone wall that dates to the 1700s. ‘‘I started following it and knew it was the site,’’ she says. Her contribution to what is now known as ‘‘Wanas Wall’’ was to carve a different phrase or truism from her past work into a stone block every 20 feet or so. ‘‘all things are delicately interconnected,’’ reads one."

It has a reserve of meaning that seems to open very slowly over a long series of readings. Part of that is due to the extreme compression of her poems, which strip away everything inessential, greatly magnifying the potency of each individual word. She puts an extraordinary pressure on language by her parsimoniousness. But she restricted not only her language very narrowly — apparently, she restricted her life very narrowly, too. Out of this came a body of poetry that really has no equivalent in American literature."

(‘‘This sketch was done in the 1800s,’’ I remember telling a Chinese college friend, awe-struck by the work’s provenance. ‘‘Oh,’’ she said, ‘‘so not too long ago.’’) We are a young country, and like most young entities — be they people or states — our internal metronome ticks a little faster; the land we inhabit may in fact be home to ancient civilizations, but America itself is new, with a sense of impatience, adventure, excitability and a cheerful lack of perspective (either charming or dangerous, depending on your point of view and the circumstances) that only the young possess. When you are immature, every bad thing can feel like a crisis, and every good thing like ecstasy; the rest of the world watches us with a sense of weariness and unflappability that is earned only after many centuries of witnessing governments and empires and civilizations and self-styled saviors rise, crescendo and tumble.

Where an Iconic East Village Photographer Lived,2017-09-25,article,News,,['Photography'],"A new photo book documents Saul Leiter’s apartment two years after his death, for a close look at what he left behind.","Two years after the New York School photographer Saul Leiter died, François Halard had the good fortune to come across the East Village apartment where Leiter lived for more than half a century. Leiter had created some of his best-known work there: gritty scenes of Manhattan streets in the ’50s and ’60s. There was almost nothing left but the barest traces of Leiter’s life — boxes of photographs, a paper lantern, an unfinished sketchbook, a lonely chair — which Halard documents in a new book. In the photographs, taken in 2015, the walls are stained and peeling, the floors spattered with paint. One can clearly see the ravages of time. Yet the soft winter light imbues the rooms with a ghostly beauty and Halard’s haunting images convey the presence of the artist and a lost time."

A New York Cheddar Aged to Perfection,2017-09-25,article,News,,['Cheese'],Murray’s Clothbound Cheddar is made from ingredients from New York State and aged for a year.,"Several years ago, Murray’s Cheese began working with Cornell University to develop an English-style clothbound Cheddar made solely with ingredients from New York State. The classic pale ivory cheese with fruity, citric flavors is now available. Some commercial Cheddars are coated in wax to prevent mold, but using cheesecloth instead allows this Cheddar to develop complex flavors as it ages. The cheese, made in very small batches at the Cornell Food Processing and Development Laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y., is aged for 12 months in Murray’s ripening caves in Queens. The resulting Cheddar has a creamy, yet firm and slightly crumbly texture. The cow milk comes from the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company in the Hudson Valley and, vegetarians should note, the wheels are rubbed with lard from New York State pigs before the cheesecloth is applied, something that is frequently done when making Cheddar: Murray’s Clothbound Cheddar, $29.99 a pound, murrayscheese.com."
