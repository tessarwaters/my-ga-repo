Count Maui, in Hawaii, among them. Axis deer, an Asian breed, were introduced for hunting in the mid-1900s, and they still attract the sharp-shooting crowd. But as their numbers have grown to the tens of thousands, the deer are also considered to be an invasive menace, not just on the roads, but for the way they denude the landscape of vegetation, causing erosion and water runoffs that can damage coral reefs. Maui Nui, a new company, is now turning them into dinner. Across the island, it harvests wild deer at night so the animals are supposedly less stressed and uses a mobile slaughtering facility. Now various cuts of venison, frozen, in preset combinations that include succulent racks, medallions, strip loins, stew meat for a nice braise and ground venison can be shipped to customers across the United States. The meat is mild-tasting, slightly beefy and tender. It’s also very lean, so add some slab bacon to your stew and plenty of olive oil to the ragù. A four-chop rack serving two will take about 20 minutes at 425 degrees for medium-rare. The company’s bone broth is delicious."

Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos gave the movement its signature forms — and influence.","“An illiterate, underbred book it seems to me: the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are, how egotistic, insistent, raw, striking & ultimately nauseating.” So goes Virginia Woolf’s well-known complaint about “Ulysses,” scribbled into her diary before she had finished reading it.

A Psychedelic Reinterpretation of Medieval Wall Tapestries,2021-03-22,article,News,,"['Textiles', 'Design', 'Interior Design and Furnishings', 'Wallpaper']",The textile maker Maharam and the design firm 2x4 have conceived a vibrant wall covering that collapses time and space.,"Wall tapestries were commissioned by the Catholic Church in the 13th and 14th centuries to communicate Bible stories to the illiterate masses, but by the Renaissance, they had become aristocratic status symbols. When kings and nobles were defeated in battle, the victor often seized the huge, intricately woven textiles, with their scenes of conflict, village life and mythical beasts, and resized them to fit the walls of their own castles, where they served as both insulation and trophies. Now, Maharam, the textile maker that began at the turn of the 20th century as a fabric pushcart on the streets of Manhattan’s Lower East Side, has reinterpreted the traditional craft. The company collaborated with the New York-based design firm 2x4, which took hundreds of public-domain images of tapestries from the 14th to the 16th centuries to create a 10-by-20-foot digital collage titled Tableau Vivant. Maharam then digitally printed the panorama onto a cellulose and latex substrate that can be applied directly to a wall (smaller sections can be customized to fit any space). From a distance, the work appears to be a museum piece, but up close — where you can see peasants pasted next to unicorns and trees growing at strange angles — it collapses time and space with a psychedelic verve.

The policy battle over the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill managed the neat trick of simultaneously uniting the Democratic Party, energizing the Biden-skeptical left and putting the Republicans way on the wrong side of public opinion. The vaccination push continues to meet its targets and the “dark winter” wave of new cases receded much faster than the new administration probably anticipated. What will hereafter be known as the “Neera Tanden gambit” appears to have successfully provided cover for the rest of Joe Biden’s cabinet to win approval, widely or narrowly, without bruising conflicts. The president’s approval/disapproval averages sit around 55 percent/39 percent, and you can shave a few points off the average out of poll-skepticism without changing Biden’s fundamentally enviable position."

An Elusive Artist’s Trove of Never-Before-Seen Images,2021-03-23,article,News,,"['Art', 'Photography']","In the years leading up to his death, Ray Johnson took up photography. Now, this body of work is shedding light on his final days.","RAY JOHNSON ARRIVED in New York City in 1949, still in his early 20s, and lived there for a two-decade span in which the dominant artists in town — abstract painters like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still — came to be regarded, especially by themselves, as seers. Johnson, however, was a prankster. Like the bunny head he adopted as his trademark — a cartoonish line drawing that appeared in much of his work, often bearing the name of a key figure in 20th-century art — he hopped lightly, merrily across this playing field. Reveling in puns and irreverence (an untitled 1973 collage known as “Jackson Pollock Fillets” includes cut-out recipes for Pollock Fillets Amandine and Barbecued Pollock Burgers), conducting his life as a nonstop performance, he revived the Dada tradition embodied by his hero Marcel Duchamp. In contrast to the grandiosity of Minimal art, land art, Pop Art and other macho midcentury movements, he offered something much humbler: collages or drawings of portable size and wry wit. As a response to Happenings, a term coined by Allan Kaprow to describe the participatory performances that flourished in New York in the early ’60s, Johnson staged Nothings, in which a befuddled audience was sometimes greeted with an empty room. He decamped to Long Island in 1968 — residing eventually in a sanctuary in Locust Valley he called the Pink House, though it wasn’t pink — and over the years his ties to his New York friends weakened."

Based in Washington, D.C., Kauffmann (Ulrich Thomsen) wheels and deals with President Franklin D.

A series of cartoonishly rapid cuts introduces Hutch (Bob Odenkirk), a mild-mannered suburban schmuck whose identical days flip past in a haze of chores and a vague desk job. His sighing wife (Connie Nielsen) and teenage son (Gage Munroe) regard him with something close to pity — especially when he balks at attacking two luckless home invaders.

‘Nina Wu’ Review: Destruction of Body and Soul,2021-03-25,article,Review,,['Movies'],An actress loses her mind in this haunting portrait of exploitation in the film industry from the Taiwanese director Midi Z.,"It’s easy enough to slap the #MeToo label on “Nina Wu” and call it a day.

‘Violation’ Review: The Trauma of Vengeance,2021-03-25,article,Review,,['Movies'],"In this thriller, a woman exacts revenge against those who betrayed her and soon discovers the cost of answering violence with more violence.","Vengeful women have long been the backbone of the thriller genre. Though Miriam (Madeleine Sims-Fewer), the protagonist of “Violation,” may wish to follow in those coldblooded footsteps, she can’t stomach her own revenge plot — literally. In one moment, when blood is shed, Miriam vomits for an uninterrupted, 78-second shot, heaving on all fours like a cat. Sims-Fewer, who wrote, directed and produced the film with Dusty Mancinelli, drank a pint of salt water so that she could actually throw up for the scene. Such merciless dedication to realism pervades the film, resulting in a revenge story that is ultimately more unsettling — and more successful — than many of its predecessors."

Wearing a tan crop top and hoop earrings, Sutton signs Megan Thee Stallion’s verse, maintaining coy eye contact with her camera as she reimagines lines like “Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me” for a Deaf audience. Sutton, of course, can’t “hear” the music in a conventional sense. But having danced since childhood, she’s found ways to channel her intuitive feel for rhythm through the vast, lexically complex language of sign, paying close attention to the vibrations of the bass pounding through her speakers or holding an eight-count so she knows when the words begin. Sutton posted the 35-second video and then closed the app for a few hours to get on with her day. She returned to thousands of likes, comments and, eventually, a retweet from Cardi B herself."
