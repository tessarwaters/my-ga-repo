(“I believe in journalism,” he told the National Press Club in 1998. “I believe deeply in journalism.” Apparently he still does; his latest venture is a partnership with The Times’s former executive editor Jill Abramson to promote articles too long for a magazine and too short for a book.)

Reviewing Grisham’s novel, Brill had some kind words for its political observations, although he didn’t think much of what he called “Grishamstyle”: “At times,” he wrote, “his weakness with words is painful to watch, . . . as if someone new to English decided to mimic ‘The Bonfire of the Vanities.’ ”"

Eve of Destruction,2015-01-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Charles Todd’s latest historical mystery opens on the day the Austrian archduke and his wife are assassinated in Sarajevo.,"Picking up one of Charles Todd’s post-World War I historical mysteries is like starting off on an uncertain journey. In each book, Inspector Ian Rutledge of Scotland Yard, a shellshocked veteran of the Great War, makes his solitary way to some provincial English town, ostensibly to assist the local constabulary with a baffling crime but also to bear witness to the incalculable devastation brought about by the fighting. In 16 previous novels, the authors (a mother and son who write under a pen name) have sent their haunted hero all over the country, taking stock of the terrible desolation he sees everywhere and knowing that true justice is beyond his powers."
"‘The Bully of Order,’ by Brian Hart",2015-01-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In a logging town on the Pacific Coast, a family grapples with violence and tragedy at the turn of the 20th century.","From the opening pages of his second novel, “The Bully of Order,” Brian Hart warns the reader of the harshness to come. “This is war but bloodier,” one voice tells another. “Nah,” the other replies, “I seen war and this is darling compared.” Those brave enough to forge ahead are soon faced with a fond recollection of a sexual act with a steer’s heart and a story that culminates in a dog’s hanging itself, among other atrocities. On Hart’s late-19th-century Pacific Coast, nothing stays clean for long, literally or spiritually: “White here is brave and temporary, steam in the windows, ice in the pan.” Violence is a way to pass the time, and time is just counting down to death. Hopes, when a character dares to have any, are shattered into pieces, those pieces burned and the ashes tossed into the ocean. "

"‘The Happiest People in the World,’ by Brock Clarke",2015-01-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Spies, terrorism, adultery, guns — Brock Clarke’s novel sets this combustible mix in remote upstate New York.","At the center of this new novel from the author of “An Arsonist’s Guide to Writers’ Homes in New England” and “Exley” is a high school guidance counselor named Henry. Well, not really. His name isn’t Henry, it’s Jens, and he isn’t a high school guidance counselor, he’s a Danish cartoonist on the run from terrorists. But he’s not one of the Danish cartoonists you’re thinking of, the ones who satirized the Muslim world with their representations of Muhammad. Rather, he’s a different Danish cartoonist, one who drew a cartoon about the other cartoonists, and whose cartoonist cartoon proves to be just as controversial as the original cartoonists’ cartoons. Anyway, for the purposes of this paragraph, let’s just say he’s a high school guidance counselor in Broomeville, N.Y., a cold and isolated upstate town. Although, really, he’s one of two guidance counselors there. The first one has been fired for being a drunk, but actually she’s been fired so that the principal of the school, Matty, who is sort of the protagonist — well, wait, he’s not really the protagonist, per se, he’s one of several people who function, at various times, as protagonists — but as I was saying, Matty has fired the original guidance counselor in order to do a favor for his ex-lover, the wildlife researcher, which is to hire Henry, who is actually Jens. Because the ex-lover, whose name is Locs but really it’s Lorraine, isn’t a wildlife researcher anymore, she’s a C.I.A. agent. And she is trying to protect the cartoonist-of-cartoonists-cum-guidance-counselor by hiding him in Broomeville from the terrorists, who are actually, it turns out, just this one guy, who, it also turns out, is not really a terrorist. But, it further turns out, she’s just trying to find a way to get Matty (whom she calls Matthew) back, though she never really had him in the first place."
"‘A Tale of Two Plantations,’ by Richard S. Dunn",2015-01-02,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Slavery (Historical)']",The lives and experiences of three generations of slaves on a Caribbean sugar estate and a Southern plantation.,"For enslaved peoples in the New World, it was always the worst of times. Whether captured in Africa or born into bondage in the Americas, slaves suffered unimaginable torments and indignities. Yet the specific form their miseries took, as the historian Richard S. Dunn shows in his painstakingly researched “A Tale of Two Plantations: Slave Life and Labor in Jamaica and Virginia,” depended on whether one was a slave in the British Caribbean or in the United States. The contrasts between the two slave societies were many, covering family life, religious beliefs and labor practices. But one difference overrode all others. In the Caribbean, white masters treated the slaves like “disposable cogs in a machine,” working them to death on sugar plantations and then replacing them with fresh stock from Africa. In the United States, white masters treated their slaves like the machine itself — a breeding machine."

Jane Gardam’s ‘Hollow Land’,2015-01-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A powerful friendship between two lads illuminates family and community ties in Jane Gardam’s linked stories.,"Just as devotees of certain television shows dream of finding lost episodes and Beatles fans imagine opening a box and fishing out recordings of forgotten studio sessions, so readers long for ways to extend the pleasure they receive from beloved writers. In this regard Jane Gardam has been more than accommodating. After American readers began to embrace the British writer’s novel “Old Filth,” released here in 2006, they learned that Gardam had been publishing fine fiction regularly since the 1970s. Her backlist is extraordinary and deep, populated by titles published only in Britain as well as ones that also appeared in America but had essentially been hiding in plain sight, the way books sometimes do when they don’t find their audience."

Each story traces a different journey, with passengers that include three Russians on their way to a new luxury spa; a Roman Catholic priest and his acolyte pursuing a kind of detective mission; a Czech couple who share a walk on a beach with a night watchman whose entire family perished, along with more than 30,000 other Sri Lankans, in the 2004 tsunami; a delegation of Chinese businessmen appraising vast “junk fields” of military scrap; and a Sri Lankan general (also a renowned ballroom dancer) en route to a meeting with a woman whose family he has all but destroyed. The 14 stories in “Noontide Toll” function like the stages of a tour through a place that’s trying to emerge from the ruins, yet is still “trapped by the past despite the prospects ahead.”"

All ships of United Kingdom and colonial registry, with the exception of vessels of Indian and Burman registry, will be taken over when they discharge their first cargo in Great Britain after that date. The scheme, identical to the one employed successfully during the World War, will make it possible to operate ships more efficiently and economically because of the community of interests of the British Dominions, it was explained. Such a control system, it was stated, will result in a regular execution of the shipping program for the efficient conduct of the war. The companies will continue to manage and operate their ships as though carrying on their own business but will receive instructions as to the cargoes to be carried and the routes to be followed. They will maintain their organizations in Britain and abroad but will keep an account of costs for the Ministry. Operating profits and losses are to be treated as on government account. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Jan. 5, 1940"

What’s On TV Monday,2015-01-05,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"10:30 A.M. (Showtime) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Mr. Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric, above at right with Max von Sydow; Emmanuelle Seigner is Céline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josée Croze is a speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. “The phrase ‘triumph of the human spirit’ hovers over ‘The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,’ along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind” — among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration — Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) “Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual,” he added, noting that Mr. Schnabel demonstrated this with “imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.”"

Reaching for Beauty,2015-01-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Picture-book biographies of the painter Benny Andrews and the soprano Leontyne Price trace their paths from African-American childhoods in the segregated South to international acclaim.,"The world has no shortage of interesting people who make a big impact without ever quite becoming household names, and lately we’ve seen a plentiful crop of picture-book biographies about some of them. Among several good recent examples are Jen Bryant and Melissa Sweet’s “The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus” and Jeanette Winter’s “Mr. Cornell’s Dream Boxes.” Both found a whimsical, child-friendly charm in the eccentricities of subjects few would have called ideal picture-book material: the neurotic Victorian Peter Mark Roget, who came up with the idea for the thesaurus, and the reclusive avant-garde artist Joseph Cornell, who innovated with assemblage. Two new ones are particularly welcome additions to the genre, for both their beautiful illustrations and their stirring stories: Each takes up the life of a 20th-century artist whose accomplishments are no doubt too rarefied to be already familiar to the average elementary schooler; but the subjects’ experiences growing up African-American in the segregated South, then making their ways through civil-rights-era America, give a natural storybook feel to their life trajectories."

The streets of American cities are haunted by the ghosts of bookstores and record stores, which have been destroyed by the greatest thugs in the history of the culture industry. Writers hover between a decent poverty and an indecent one; they are expected to render the fruits of their labors for little and even for nothing, and all the miracles of electronic dissemination somehow do not suffice for compensation, either of the fiscal or the spiritual kind. Everybody talks frantically about media, a second-order subject if ever there was one, as content disappears into “content.” What does the understanding of media contribute to the understanding of life? Journalistic institutions slowly transform themselves into silent sweatshops in which words cannot wait for thoughts, and first responses are promoted into best responses, and patience is a professional liability. As the frequency of expression grows, the force of expression diminishes: Digital expectations of alacrity and terseness confer the highest prestige upon the twittering cacophony of one-liners and promotional announcements. It was always the case that all things must pass, but this is ridiculous."

The state can appeal the decision, and animal rights groups warned that restaurants that serve it could face protests. “Foie gras is French for ‘fatty liver,’ and ‘fathead’ is the American word for the shameless chefs who actually need a law to make them stop serving the swollen, near-bursting organ of a cruelly force-fed bird,” Ingrid E.

Organized by the art historian Robert Hobbs, the exhibition presents seven things, which he introduces as “works that pit people’s sight and insight against the limits of what they are able to comprehend.”"

As I telegraphed to you yesterday [Jan. 8], no funeral ever drew so vast a crowd, and General Ricciotti Garibaldi’s heartfelt words over his son’s grave, foreshadowing Italy’s speedy avenging of the lieutenant’s death, stirred the blood of the whole nation. There was, at the beginning of the European war, a great outburst on the part of the Italian people. War against Austria appeared inevitable, as a consequence of the aggressive action against Servia, which action, in case it proved successful, would have profoundly affected the Balkanic equilibrium. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Jan. 10, 1915"

We were making a documentary about Jean Cabut, known as Cabu, one of the most famous cartoonists in France. So we were there, filming his conversation with his colleagues as they chose the cover.

Like “The Boy Kings of Texas” — Martinez’s first memoir, which was a 2012 finalist for the National Book Award and was recently optioned for an HBO series — his latest, “My Heart Is a Drunken Compass,” is a tragic comedy filled with wit and cultural insight.

The world remembers Virginia better than her enigmatic older sister: Parmar restores the symmetry of their relationship in the familial landscape, showing how essential Vanessa’s steadying force was to Virginia’s precarious balance.

Please Look After This Bear,2015-01-09,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],The stories of Paddington’s adventures bounce along with a Wodehousian lightness and consistency.,"When Paddington Bear landed in London in 1958, it was still quite a provincial place. Safe, settled, a little gray — no sign of the Beatles or the swinging ’60s yet — it upheld the ceremonial proprieties immortalized in “Brief Encounter” and “84, Charing Cross Road.” Men wore ties to dinner, women skirts; the post-nuclear nightmares and beatnik explosions of America were barely visible on occasional television screens. Yes, the likes of the Trinidad-born novelist Samuel Selvon were beginning to give voice to other realities in works like “The Lonely Londoners,” but if a British family’s name was Brown, you could be fairly sure its skin was not."
"‘China 1945,’ by Richard Bernstein",2015-01-09,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'World War II (1939-45)']","With the defeat of Japan, the United States hoped to prevent civil war in China.","“To err is human. To blame someone else is politics.” Hubert H. Humphrey’s aphorism came to mind as I was reading “China 1945,” Richard Bernstein’s excellent history of United States policy toward China at the end of World War II. The comment is particularly apt when intractable problems provide myriad paths to failure but no clear right answer — and the civil war in China after Japan’s surrender was just such a problem. (Today, think of Syria.) The debates over China policy were acrimonious and personal, and this was several years before Joseph McCarthy lent his name to sneering political assassination."
"‘It Will End With Us,’ by Sam Savage",2015-01-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Sam Savage’s novel of a South Carolina family in decline is constructed from a daughter’s scattered memories.,"“I wasn’t going to begin again, having stopped, apparently, and started up again, foolishly, too many times already.” So protests Eve Taggart, the narrator of Sam Savage’s fifth novel, “It Will End With Us.” Like the first-person narrators of Savage’s earlier work, Eve begins with the intention, or at least the possibility, of ending in mind. This awareness that the narrative may be abandoned gives the book the feel of being cobweb-slight. It seems arbitrary, almost incidental; yet the text’s fragility reads as purity of a kind."
"‘American Queen,’ by John Oller",2015-01-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A biography of the socialite Kate Chase Sprague, daughter of a cabinet minister, wife of a governor, mistress of a senator.","In the prelude to her great novel “Middlemarch,” George Eliot meditates on the fate of heroic women “who found for themselves no epic life” equal to their passion and intellect, but instead “only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity.” One wonders what Eliot would have made of Kate Chase Sprague — daughter of a Civil War-era American cabinet minister, wife of a governor, mistress of a senator — whose career as a ­behind-the-scenes kingmaker is chronicled in John Oller’s “American Queen.” Beautiful, wealthy and clever, she could dazzle a Washington salon or (said one historian) “scheme like a cigar-­chewing convention rigger.” But her horizons were limited by the same constraints that tied Eliot’s heroine Dorothea Brooke, and the results for her bordered on the tragic."
"‘My Life as a Foreign Country,’ by Brian Turner",2015-01-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A poet and Army veteran presents vignettes that draw on his family history and his deployments, especially in Iraq.","There’s a persistent idea in our culture that what we experience is “true,” while what we imagine is “untrue.” But without exploring the possibility of imagination in nonfiction, we leave out a fundamental part of the human experience — digressive wanderings, the chaotic interior self and, most important, our empathy. Empathy, after all, starts as an act of fiction. We must think ourselves into the lives of others. "
"‘Cowardice: A Brief History,’ by Chris Walsh",2015-01-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A study of cowardice, and of how it’s been understood and misunderstood through history.","“Cowardice” is not quite one of those words, like “honor,” whose meaning was once understood by everyone but is now understood by almost no one. Yet its meaning has lately become more elusive. Are suicide bombers “cowardly,” as we are so often assured they are, or insanely courageous? Is it more cowardly to refuse to fight or to fight for fear of being called a coward for not fighting? Some people claim to have the answers to such questions about this once familiar and unproblematic subject, but they tend to disagree. There is no consensus as to who is a coward and who is not — or even about whether the question is one of any importance. Cowardice, whatever it means, must seem a matter of individual choice, like everything else, and the implied judgment made by the term probably requires that we decline to use it at all."
"‘All Eyes Are Upon Us,’ by Jason Sokol",2015-01-09,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'United States Politics and Government']",Northerners applauded individual high-achieving African-Americans but opposed collective civil rights agendas.,"If, as many believe, America’s experiment in postracialism is over, then “All Eyes Are Upon Us” is a prescient book that offers a great deal to explain a national self-deception of stunning brevity. According to Jason Sokol, whose anecdotally rich first book, “There Goes My Everything,” tracked white Southerners variously coping in the civil rights era, historians have paid insufficient attention to the Janus-faced ­responses of white Northerners to the struggles of black Americans. To be sure, monographs by James Goodman and Thomas Sugrue have explored the dark side of Northern race relations. They found that although the dominant racial philosophies of whites in the North and South were antithetical, opportunity for a majority of black men and women in the North was not very different from what it was in the South."

Inside the List,2015-01-09,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Tess Gerritsen, whose “Die Again” is No. 5 on the hardcover fiction list, briefly assumed a new role last winter: organic farmer.","Home to Roost: Fans of the doctor-turned-romance-novelist-turned-thriller-writer Tess Gerritsen (whose latest Rizzoli and Isles mystery, “Die Again,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 5) may not know that last winter she briefly assumed yet another role: organic farmer. When Gerritsen’s son wanted a vacation from the farm he and his partner own in Maine, his parents agreed to take over for two weeks. “There’s a comforting rhythm to farming,” Gerritsen wrote on her blog. “Every morning, the cows stand eagerly at the fence, excited to see us bringing hay, and the sheep come stam­peding like hungry children. . . . I’ve found out that I love hanging out with chickens. I’ve learned which hen leaves the flock every morning to hide out with the sheep, and which hen sneaks away to spend time with the outcast rooster. I’ve learned the secret places where those two lay their eggs. I’ve learned that the alpha rooster can be brutal with hens (and I’m going to talk to my son about turning him into coq au vin).” The wry sadism of that last sentence won’t surprise Gerritsen’s readers — in the opening pages of “Die Again,” a murdered taxidermist is discovered “hung and dressed like game” in his garage, with organs discarded in a nearby trash can. The inspiration for the organs, at least, may have come from the farm. “Thanks to my son,” Gerritsen wrote when her stint was done, “I’ve also been blessed with a bountiful supply of free-range eggs and chicken livers. Will all this turn up in a book some day? Trust me, I’m thinking about it.”"
"‘Lives in Ruins,’ by Marilyn Johnson",2015-01-09,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'ARCHAEOLOGY']","Exploring the world of archaeology, with tips for making ancient alcoholic drinks and fashioning a butcher blade from obsidian.","The past has a way of suddenly speaking to us. When images appear, for example, of human hands that archaeologists say were stenciled 40,000 years ago, a haunted feeling of connection and perspective quickly emerges. But many archaeologists themselves seem to experience this sense of connection more or less continuously. As Marilyn Johnson suggests in “Lives in Ruins,” her lively survey of archaeology and the people who practice it, it fuels their dedication to the job, which they desperately need because the actual work and the challenges involved are pretty continuous as well.

"‘Sailing the Forest: Selected Poems,’ by Robin Robertson",2015-01-09,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets']",A career-spanning collection of poems from one of Scotland’s most intriguing literary voices.,"It’s impossible to talk about the poetry of Robin Robertson without talking about sex, but to do so is to slip into perilous waters. And by “waters” I mean a hot tub. Because you can’t bring up sexy poetry without thinking of Roger and Virginia Klarvin, the randy and dithyrambic professors (played by Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch) who always seemed to be in the middle of a steamy soak on “Saturday Night Live.” If even the most masterly fiction writers botch the job of describing the erotic act, it’s more challenging still for poets. One false move and they run the risk of sounding like Mr. Klarvin, the grandiloquent scholar and “love-ah” who proclaimed, in one episode, that “beneath the surface of these very waters a virtual ant farm of activity is taking place.”"

A Civil War veteran with a sketchy past, Hale heads west in 1869 simply because it seems like a good idea: “Everybody said it was the place to be — with free land and open skies.” What everybody doesn’t say is that it’s also a land of treachery, deception, double-dealing, torture, warfare and death.

Collaborating with Max Pearmain, the stylist and editor of fashion magazine Arena Homme Plus, as well as the art director Jonathan Baron, Pieter created a voyeuristic look at the new collection, which features a cool merging of activewear with unconventional tailoring and knitwear: athletic tights layered under knit tops with slashed openings (inspired by Lucio Fontana paintings) and unstructured outerwear made from fabrics typically used for uniforms of the Royal Guard. Filmed in a bleak office environment with expansive views of London’s Financial District and composed of grainy time-stamped clips mimicking security footage, the video, which will run on loop during the presentation, “grounds the clothes,” says the young designer (albeit rather eerily). For this new season, as with his previous two collections, Pieter, who worked both in publishing (Fantastic Man) and design (for Jil Sander under Raf Simons) before launching his own line in early 2014, explores the loosening and blurring of men’s sartorial norms through more feminine cuts and roomier silhouettes. “There’s a dark twisted way of sexuality,” Pieter says, “that I’m always thinking about.”"

What’s on TV Saturday,2015-01-10,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (CUNY) ONE DAY YOU’LL UNDERSTAND (2008) As the 1987 trial of the Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie unfolds on television, a Frenchman, Victor Bastien (Hippolyte Girardot), pores over old family documents and finds an “Aryan declaration” written by his deceased father — a discovery that upends his concept of his history. His mother, Rivka (Jeanne Moreau), a Jewish woman living an elegant life, evades Victor’s questions. “Rivka’s embrace of that life can look like a form of denial, but as Ms. Moreau’s performance unfolds, the character’s courage and resilience emerge more pointedly into view,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this meditation on memory, identity and reconciliation from the Israeli director Amos Gitai based on a book by Jérôme Clément. She “gives a master class in how to be regal without vanity and how to use the hard-won charisma of a movie star to illuminate the dignity of an ordinary person.” The film “contains no great revelations or surprises, but rather is suffused with a quiet glow of sympathy and enlightenment,” he added."

Judge J. Paul Oetken dismissed a class-action lawsuit by Haitians against the United Nations, deeming the organization immune because of treaties.

Other curators don’t live with artists.” Another thing about Geldzahler, according to David Hockney: “Henry had a fantastic eye. He wasn’t wrong about anything. He was always right.”"

The first is, if you can’t picture yourself reading a particular book nightly for, oh, two straight months, don’t even bring it into the house. Small children have a huge appetite for repetition, and you never know what will catch their interest. So be wary. I recently brought home “Hello Kitty Goes to Camp,” which comes with postcards to send home, thinking it would be an opportunity for “ironic” bonding with my frighteningly culturally sophisticated preteenage daughter. She didn’t bite. Then the 4-year-old found it and, fascinated by his sister’s two recent sleepaway camp disappearances, has demanded to hear it for many, many nights now."

These weren’t the thrifty sort of cords one might expect, however. The new designer Alex Mullins, who debuted his collection in a fluorescent-lit room filled with empty cardboard boxes, featured Me Decade-inspired knits and denim as well as corduroy. One look referenced the classic professorial type (think Donald Sutherland in the 1978 comedy “Animal House”), but its slightly odd proportions — cropped and flared trousers with a fitted jacket — made the suit more eccentric than dowdy. J.W. Anderson incorporated the durable ridged fabric — in a very ’70s powder blue, to boot — into a short zipped jacket with a contrasting black collar. Styled with a pair of leather trousers on a model with slick hair, the jacket looked sharp, urbane and dangerously cool. And at Burberry Prorsum, the British fashion house’s traditional trench was fabricated in a larger-scaled corduroy, giving the coat a bit more heft and the retro cloth a much more modern vibe."

Christopher Shannon, who has made it his signature to deconstruct and dissect active sportswear, used his designs as commentary on commercial industries and the economy. With slogans like “Thanks 4 Nothing,” “Save Me” and “Broke” knitted into brightly colored intarsia jumpers, the ostensibly humorous collection revealed a darker undercurrent. While Sarah Burton’s military-inspired collection for Alexander McQueen displayed a mastery of tailoring, the bold capitalized words “HONOUR,” “VALOUR” and “TRUTH” inscribed across blazers and coats made a bigger statement. And lastly, the American designer Shaun Samson, who returned with a runway show after two seasons away, brought a Southern California flair to the London scene with his collection of bold flannel plaids, Dickies-inspired chinos and aprons adorned with the phrases “DELUSIONAL RADICAL BLISS” and “GNARLY DANK DUDE.”"

Alexandra Fuller’s ‘Leaving Before the Rains Come’,2015-01-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"After a divorce, Alexandra Fuller looks to her Zambian past for guidance in leading an independent life.","A memoir often takes one of two basic forms: In the first, the writer has an extraordinary story to tell; in the second, she has the ability to tell the common story in an extraordinary way. Sometimes — Mary McCarthy’s “Memories of a Catholic Girlhood” is an example, Paula Fox’s “Borrowed Finery” another — the two are conflated in events on whose extremity the artistic mind succeeds in imposing literary form. I once heard the writer Aharon Appelfeld, asked why he had underplayed the savagery of his Holocaust childhood in one of his books, give the answer that extremity, whether imaginary or real, is harmful to art. What he perhaps meant was that the artist’s aim is to represent truth, and that certain experiences — those that infringe or violate the common sense of reality — can never be made to seem true. Joan Didion dealt interestingly with this problem in “The Year of Magical Thinking,” making the surreality of her husband’s death at the dinner table a space the reader could philosophically inhabit. And likewise Alexandra Fuller, writing about her often tragically idiosyncratic African childhood in “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,” brilliantly succeeded in retaining a child’s astonished objectivity at the unfolding of bizarre events."

Then, five years later in summer 2013, the Pompidou and the Louvre joined forces to present joint exhibitions by Gréaud, another first."

His ballets also contain despair, jealousy and satire, but he confined those things to acting. He expressed delight by means of dances, made especially in terms of pure classical ballet. This week, principals and soloists of the Royal Danish Ballet perform six of those dance sequences at the Joyce Theater.

Their performances are not exactly subtle — nothing in ‘The Lunchbox’ is exactly subtle — but they are graceful and dignified in the manner of movie stars in an earlier, less aggressive age, ennobling the ordinary lives they explore.

In an echo of “All About Eve,” Doll picks up her friend’s script and starts reading aloud. “ 'Why didn’t you call me?’ ‘I didn’t think it was my place,' ” she says, intoning both parts and knowing she’s overstepping. The script is terrible. It’s derivative. But it’s a transgressive moment for Doll and a distillation of her complicated envy toward Em. The sharp parody happening in that scene — of great films, of female friendship, of Hollywood’s idea of better roles for women — coexists with an air of unstudied sincerity that’s in fact subversive. It’s a mood typical of the show and bespeaks a broader sophistication that has finally found its way onto the small screen, over a decade into what we’ve so often heard is a TV renaissance."

The “oval, sort of man-sized, shimmering thing” not only transports them to other worlds; it also serves as the reader’s entree to the rest of the book, with its array of futuristic and surreal psychic landscapes. The breezy blend of realism and fantasy is characteristic: The narrator, a world-weary dad, describes the first giddy era of exploration, which soon declines into domestic dysfunction as his children hit puberty and his wife grows distant. The portal, mirroring this entropy, becomes “lopsided, with a sort of hernia in the lower left corner,” and the narrator is left bereft and aching, trying to find his way back to some semblance of enchantment.

"‘The First Bad Man,’ by Miranda July",2015-01-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A perverse houseguest shakes the world of the initially passive protagonist of Miranda July’s first novel.,"Cheryl Glickman has a psychosomatic lump in her throat that sometimes prevents her from swallowing. She also has a burning crush on a man named Phillip Bettelheim who wants her blessing before he consummates his love for an underage girl, and a karmic connection with a child she calls Kubelko Bondy, whose spirit continually appears to her in other people’s babies. Cheryl is the protagonist of Miranda July’s very funny debut novel, “The First Bad Man,” and she’s such an acute observer that her life is never as pathetic to the reader as it appears to the people around her. She has developed systems for everything, including a rigid housekeeping asceticism that helps her stave off the kind of debilitating sadness that, if left unchecked, can snowball from letting dirty dishes pile up in the sink to eating off said dirty dishes, to no longer bathing, to urinating in cups because they’re closer to the bed. Her ideal is unruffled contentment. When things really flow, she says, “my days become dreamlike, no edges anywhere, none of the snags and snafus that life is so famous for. After days and days alone it gets silky to the point where I can’t even feel myself anymore, it’s as if I don’t exist.” "

Inside the List,2015-01-16,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Pierce Brown says his novel “Golden Son,” which is No. 6 on the hardcover fiction list, “echoes a lot of the dissatisfaction that many people feel” with the political system.","Bullies Are From Mars: “Golden Son,” the second novel in Pierce Brown’s Red Rising trilogy, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 6. The plot of these books — in which a charismatic hero makes his way from Mars’s oppressed underclass into the ruling elite, where he plans a secret insurrection — has reminded some critics of the Hunger Games series, while putting others (O.K., me) in mind of Arthur Krystal’s observation about pulp fiction: “Skilled genre writers know that a certain level of artificiality must prevail, lest the reasons we turn to their books evaporate.” But in an interview last year with the publishing trade magazine Kirkus, Brown, who is 26, suggested the series is less artificial than it seems, at least to the extent it reflects his generation’s distrust of the political system. “I’m not trying to make a statement,” he said; “I just think it echoes a lot of the dissatisfaction that many people feel with those who make the decisions based on their own self-interests, rather than what is in the best interests of society. It’s people being selfish.” In the same interview, Brown said his views of cliques and social structures had been shaped in part by his childhood experiences moving from state to state with his family. “A lot of times, I faced bullies — or the ‘big dogs’ at school. What I wanted ‘Red Rising’ to be is not necessarily an indictment on bullies, but it reflects my experiences and attitudes that I had with bullies growing up. A lot of times, you had to beat the bullies at their own game. But the difficulty is not becoming the bully yourself.”"

Nigeria was the first country in Africa to report H5N1 in poultry, in 2006, according to the World Health Organization.  "

Lancelot Thwaytes sued Sotheby’s for £11 million (about $16.7 million) in damages, claiming that the auctioneers had insufficiently researched his painting “The Cardsharps.” The auction house described the work, below, which depicts two hustlers trying to cheat another man in a card game, as a 17th-century copy of the original by the Italian master Caravaggio. The painting was purchased by a friend of the British collector Denis Mahon, who died in 2011 and who, after further analysis, declared it an authentic Caravaggio and valued the painting at £10 million. The Financial Times reported that Judge Vivien Rose dismissed Mr. Thwaytes’s claim, saying in her ruling that the auctioneers had examined the painting thoroughly, and reasonably concluded that the painting was not of high enough quality to be a Caravaggio. The disputed painting is currently on loan to the Museum of the Order of St John in London."

What’s On TV Monday,2015-01-19,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TMC) STARRING SIDNEY POITIER Stanley Kramer’s “The Defiant Ones” (1958), about an uneducated black convict on a chain gang who goes on the lam with his “other half,” a white Southern bigot portrayed by Tony Curtis, above left, ushers in this tribute to Mr. Poitier, right (between them is Cara Williams). In 1964, Mr. Poitier became the first black person to win a best-actor Oscar and three years later was the nation’s top box-office draw. “In its candid presentment of racial conflict and resentment,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, “it rips right into the subject with clawing ferocity and flails it about with merciless fury until all the viciousness in conflict is spent.” In James Clavell’s “To Sir, With Love” (1967), at 10, Mr. Poitier stars as Thackeray, an idealistic new teacher in London assigned to a school near the city’s docks, where his Cockney-accented students are ill mannered and insolent. Christian Roberts plays Denham, the arrogant teenager who incites Thackeray’s latest classroom edict: If the students want to be treated as the adults they are about to become, they must act like adults. “A nice air of gentility suffuses this pretty color film, and Mr. Poitier gives a quaint example of being proper and turning the other cheek,” Mr. Crowther wrote. And in Mr. Kramer’s “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” (1967), at midnight, the liberal principles of an aging couple (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) are tested when their daughter (Katharine Houghton) announces her engagement to a black doctor (Mr. Poitier). Mr. Crowther called the movie “a most delightfully acted and gracefully entertaining film, fashioned much in the manner of a stage drawing-room comedy, that seems to be about something much more serious and challenging than it actually is.”"

"At the Fall/Winter 2015 Men’s Shows, A Crop of Pumpkin Pieces",2015-01-20,article,News,,['Oranges'],There have been enough pops of burnt orange on the runway to inspire otherwise cautious men to take on the autumnal shade.,"When it comes to the fall/winter 2015 men’s wear shows, to declare that “orange is the new black” would be to misrepresent most guys’ willingness to experiment with color. So far this season, though, there have been enough pops of burnt orange on the runway to inspire at least somewhat adventurous men to take on the autumnal shade, à la River Phoenix in the film “My Own Private Idaho.” In London at the Margaret Howell show, an orange jumper — worn on a red-headed model for extra oomph — brought new life to the British designer’s usually somber palette. In Milan, where the shows concluded today, the color continued to permeate some of the bigger collections. For Bottega Veneta, Tomas Maier played with a range of hues, from purple and kelly green to what he called “persimmon,” an orange shade that was deftly implemented in knits, outerwear and accessories like the above scarf. For Jil Sander’s men’s debut under the creative direction of Rodolfo Paglialunga, the designer also deployed accents of retro-inspired colors, including mustard and hunter green as well as a rusty shade seen in a covetable drop-shouldered textured polo. Though the copper-colored teddy-bear coat in No.21’s collection might be a stretch for some men, the matching sweater worn underneath is a much more palatable option to try next fall."

The improving economy has finally boosted his poll numbers toward at least the mid-40s, probably because plunging gas prices have finally delivered an effective wage increase. His power grab on immigration also seems to have been a limited political success: The move was broadly unpopular but neither immigration nor executive power are top-of-mind issues for most voters, the president’s standing with Hispanics has clearly improved, a brief period of media chiding soon gave way (predictably) to media forgetfulness, and the Republican opposition has been (also predictably) divided and disorganized. And on foreign policy, while the days of presidential rhetoric about allegedly ending wars and routing Al Qaeda are over, there hasn’t been a return to the crisis atmosphere of last spring and summer, giving the president breathing room to claim (plausibly in the case of Russia, less so in the case of ISIS) that his strategies are working."

He realizes reality must win in the end, although the fact that the scene that symbolizes this — his ex-wife shooting Bogart in the chest — is itself a re-­enactment of a scene from “They Drive by Night” tells you something about the elasticity of the medium, which, like Escher’s eternal stairwell, feeds even our dreams of escape from the movies. We all agree with Allen, on some level. A life lived at a constant pitch of screwball comedy is a recipe for exhaustion. The relationship of most movie couples would not last five minutes beyond the closing credits of the films in which they appear. And yet such is the movies’ unrivaled express train to the limbic brain, where Ingrid Bergman’s face appears projected the size of a mother as seen by an infant, that trying to see what the medium has done to the shape of our desires can be as difficult as trying to see the edges of the sky."

But now Decca has issued some classic opera recordings from its catalog remastered from the original tapes in what is called Blu-ray Pure Audio. I’m loath to apply the word “pure” to anything. Still, listening to this reissue of the landmark 1972 recording of Puccini’s “Turandot,” with the dynamic Zubin Mehta conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra and a dream cast headed by Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti, I have to say the sound quality is clean, vivid and strikingly detailed. Ms. Sutherland, the reigning bel canto soprano of her day, was tempted into the studio to sing Turandot, a vocally weighty role she never performed in a house. Her voice is gleaming and penetrating, and Mr. Mehta draws surprising intensity from an artist who could be stolid. Mr. Pavarotti is in his prime as Calaf. With the sumptuous Montserrat Caballé as Liù, Nicolai Ghiaurov as Timur and, of all people, Peter Pears as the old emperor, this is quite the cast. (Anthony Tommasini)"

When a writer changes names and genres, for one thing — as did the British author Paula Hawkins, whose “debut thriller,” “The Girl on the Train,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 2. To judge from the Q. and A. at her publisher’s website, you’d never know that Hawkins, a financial journalist for 15 years, previously wrote romantic comedies under a pseudonym. “That was women’s fiction, I suppose,” Hawkins told NPR in a recent interview. “Much more lighthearted, not so much killing. . . . I did enjoy writing them, but they kept getting darker and darker. And once I started writing this book I knew this was what I was supposed to be doing. It just felt completely right for me. This sounds awful, but I’m not, you know, a joyful, romantic person. Well, I can be, but I’ve got a proper dark side and I enjoy indulging it.” She’s not kidding: “The Girl on the Train” is about an alcoholic commuter, fired from her job, who spins an obsessive fantasy about a couple along her train route and who may know something about the wife’s disappearance. (Comparisons to “Gone Girl” are not misplaced.) I had no luck unearthing Hawkins’s earlier pseudonym, but I did find a financial guide she published under her own name in Britain, “The Money Goddess,” which invents a group of “Sex and the City""-like friends as it dispenses advice about shopping for mortgages or planning for retirement. It’s the “Bridget Jones of finance,” according to one Amazon customer, who awarded it four out of five stars."

"‘Marissa Mayer and the Fight to Save Yahoo!,’ by Nicholas Carlson",2015-01-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In 2012, Marissa Mayer was tasked with reversing the fortunes of a struggling Internet pioneer.","One day in 2012, Marissa Mayer was whirling around Yahoo’s office in Sunnyvale, Calif., directing a redesign of the home page and the company’s uncool but still widely used email application. The next, she was the proud mother of her first child, who was nicknamed BBBB in the hospital, for Big Baby Boy Bogue (her husband’s last name). This would hardly be considered extraordinary if it weren’t for the fact that she had recently been named the company’s C.E.O. Female chief executives typically live in glass boxes where every move they make is held up for intense public scrutiny, and most get themselves there through brutal amounts of work and by avoiding anything that draws attention to the fact that they’re women. Yet right after starting her job running a troubled $30 billion technology giant, Mayer announced that she would be taking a maternity leave, albeit a stunningly short one. (She took two weeks.) The audacity of the move — accepting a top executive job knowing that she was five months pregnant and then taking so little time off — prompted an Internet outcry (“The Pregnant C.E.O.: Should You Hate Marissa Mayer?” Forbes asked in one representative example), in which even progressives grumbled about the privilege involved, including Mayer’s household staff and in-office nursery. And so it was that her upsetting of the women’s­-issues industrial complex became all that most people know about Mayer. Yet there is much more to the picture. "

Man-made catastrophes, like wars or nuclear accidents, provide infinite opportunities for blame, recrimination and lessons learned. But natural disasters have no politics. One can quibble about the height of sea walls, the promptness of warnings and the quality of aid given to survivors. But such events have always occurred in countries like Japan, and always will. When the wave has receded, the dead have been counted and the slow work of recovery has begun, the pundits sheepishly quit the field and abandon it to the theologians, the spiritualists and the priests."

This elasticity is also a sign that unlike, say, the epic or the ode, the novel is a living, evolving form.

When Mango Mania Was Revolutionary ,2015-01-25,article,News,,"['Art', 'Mangoes']",Mango madness pervaded Chinese culture in 1968.,"In 1968, two years after he began the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong wrested it from the hands of avid but unruly students and handed it over to a more worshipful working class. During the transition, he happened to receive, as an ambassadorial gift from Pakistan, a basket of fresh mangoes. And as a symbolic act of largess, he had the exotic fruit delivered to a group of workers. In doing so, he created an instant cult. Not only was the fruit not eaten, but it was also revered as an emblem of the leader’s godlike love. The mangoes were preserved and became objects of worship. Wax and plastic duplicates were created and enshrined. Mango madness pervaded the culture: Images of the yellow fruit appeared in posters, on porcelain and in textile designs. “Mao’s Golden Mangoes and the Cultural Revolution,” a China Institute exhibition organized by the art historian Alfreda Murck, perfectly captures the devotional fervor of that moment. And a mere moment it was. Within a year, the fad was over. Mango memorabilia went into closets and then to flea markets, from which Ms. Murck, who lived many years in Beijing, rescued choice examples to tell this fascinating tale of consumerist infatuation.

What’s On TV Monday,2015-01-26,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TCM) DIRECTED BY LUIS BUÑUEL This five-film tribute to Buñuel (1900-1983), known as the father of Surrealist cinema, begins with “Belle de Jour” (1968), starring Catherine Deneuve (above right, with Geneviève Page) as a frigid young housewife able to achieve sexual satisfaction only after becoming a prostitute. Writing in The New York Times, Renata Adler called “Belle de Jour” “a really beautiful movie, and somehow, letting the color in — this is Buñuel’s first color film — has changed the emotional quality of his obsessions in a completely unpredictable way.” In “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” (1972), an Oscar-winner for best foreign film, at 10, six upwardly mobile friends try to have dinner together — but find they can’t. “In addition to being extraordinarily funny and perfectly acted,” Vincent Canby wrote, “ ‘The Discreet Charm’ moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Buñuel’s experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis.” The lineup continues with “Diary of a Chambermaid” (1964), an adaptation of the novel by Octave Mirbeau about the foibles and hypocrisy of the landed gentry as seen through the eyes of a worldly domestic (Jeanne Moreau), at midnight; “Viridiana” (1962), in which a young nun (Silvia Pinal) tries to help the poor after inheriting a fortune, at 2 a.m.; and “The Exterminating Angel” (1962), where guests at a lavish dinner party in an elegant home in Mexico City find themselves unable to leave the parlor for several days, during which the social order begins to break down, at 3:45."

Their teams were mostly bad, their owner was an embarrassment, their stadium a dump. Yet the Patriots always retained a lovable haplessness about them, with their cute minuteman logos, their A.F.L. lineage and the identity crisis that comes from being named after an entire region instead of a city or state.

The actors, both 43, have become synonymous with the kind of quirky indie fare that has come to epitomize Sundance over the years: Ryder, as the breakout star of “Beetlejuice” and with her roles in the cult films “Heathers” and “Edward Scissorhands” in the late ’80s and early ’90s; and Sarsgaard with celebrated turns in the Sundance films “The Dying Gaul,” “An Education” and “Garden State,” among others. This week, they star alongside one another for the first time in “Experimenter,” the director Michael Almereyda’s drama about the social psychologist Stanley Milgram and his controversial experiments on obedience in the 1960s. It’s a peculiar film — as Milgram, Sarsgaard routinely breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera; at several points an elephant appears from seemingly nowhere to hint at the deeper meaning behind Milgram’s experiments — and yet it never crumbles under its own weight, thanks to the steady talents of Sarsgaard and Ryder, who plays Milgram’s wife, Sasha.

It could be the case — it’s about pushing boundaries and experimenting.” Asked to select a standout item, Kronthaler mentions the Pirate Trouser, originally from Westwood’s 1981 Pirate collection, for its “muscly, active-looking, dynamic leg shape”; Leon, however, declined to choose just one. “It’s hard to pick specifics because it’s about telling the whole story,” he says."

Yasmina Reza’s ‘Happy Are the Happy’,2015-01-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Yasmina Reza’s novel tells interlinked stories of yearning.,"Like a handful of the 18 people who populate her latest novel, “Happy Are the Happy,” Yasmina Reza is formidably accomplished. A prolific novelist and playwright — two of her works for the stage, “Art” and “God of Carnage,” won Tony Awards for best play — as well as a screenwriter and actress, she haunts the halls of power in her native France. “Happy Are the Happy” is another coup, a quick and delicate book that’s as funny as it is humane. Each of its short chapters, titled with the name of the character speaking, is told in the first person and concerns, for the most part, other characters in the book soon to introduce themselves if they haven’t already. Everyone gets a word in, and the style is feathery as gossip. Characters chime with one another in ways they never realize, a conviviality that is bittersweet. Their voices are self-aware, a little jaundiced, vulnerable, sometimes plaintive, and entirely authentic. Accomplishment, Reza suggests, is no hedge against yearning or regret. Status, wealth, celebrity, sex appeal and good health are unevenly distributed and ­underappreciated, until they are in decline. Life isn’t sparkly, it’s a slog: “People, practically oldsters, lurching around Paris, bearing their lives.” Perhaps chasing the impractical is simply a way to stay in motion."

The friendliness of the people is what’s most appealing in this small and very walkable city, from smiling servers to talkative bartenders to helpful strangers on the street. Visit Belfast to soak up good vibes, to eat well and to drink unstintingly. It’s a city that’s at its best when enjoyed from behind a pint glass."

An Inventive Postwar Japanese Painter Has His Moment,2015-01-28,article,News,,"['Art', 'Collectors and Collections']","Four exhibitions in New York and Dallas this winter and spring will showcase the work of Kazuo Shiraga, known as the “foot painter” of the underrepresented Gutai Art Association.","Ironically, Kazuo Shiraga’s feet were nearly his feet of clay. The breakout star of the Gutai Art Association, Shiraga became colloquially known as the “foot painter”; the Japanese postwar movement’s founder, Jiro Yoshihara, even dismissed Shiraga as a “nobody, if he didn’t paint with his feet.” After his 1955 performance “Challenging Mud,” in which the artist wrestled a mixture of cement, gravel, clay, plaster, pebbles and twigs into a “formless form,” Shiraga devised an entirely new painting technique. From 1959 onward, he suspended himself from his studio ceiling and manipulated the paint exclusively with his ten toes to create a range of textures from the slinky and supple to the protruding and violent. Almost 60 years later, Shiraga, whose dynamic contributions blend painting and performance, is still a misunderstood radical who is only now receiving the sort of American institutional and gallery attention that properly contextualizes the depth and reach of his practice."

These shows often represent dealers, their gallery directors or invited curators — usually artists or critics — thinking slightly or very outside the box, putting together disparate works often by younger or lesser-known artists, in new and illuminating combinations. The dizzying bounty here reveals not only the elastic nature of the words “art” and “artist” but also of the group-show format itself. "

Steven Sebring’s 360-degree photographs of Krakoff’s designs — the same signature technique utilized in the photographer’s recent book featuring Coco Rocha, “Study of Pose” — will also be on prominent display. “The juxtaposition of these things tells a story,” Krakoff says. “It’s different than the typical shopping experience.”"

Fuller’s new book describes the collapse of her marriage, and in a recent interview with the Times reporter Penelope Green she bristled at the idea that she would have shown a draft to her ex-husband. “There’s almost this expectation you need to get approval,” she said. “I doubt Ernest Hemingway was asked what his ex-wives thought of his writing. I think women have to stop asking for permission.” She didn’t say, though, whether she had shared the memoir with her children, who are 21, 17 and 9. So I asked. “There’s a very fine line,” she said by phone from Washington, D.C., where she was on book tour, “between protecting your children, as you should, and smothering them to the point that they don’t know what’s going down in the world.” She had offered to show relevant passages to her older two, and Sarah, the 21-year-old, took her up on it. “She’s a fantastic writer in her own way,” Fuller said. “At the same time I was working on this book, she wrote an essay about the divorce for her student magazine. It was so poignant. My ex-husband read it and said, That’s not what happened. But of course it was totally from her perspective. It’s another prism. We’re reading each other’s stuff now not just as people who were personally involved, but as writers able to appreciate each other’s talent.” And her 17-year-old son? Fuller laughed. “He has better boundaries than anyone I know. He said, Mum, I lived it. I don’t need to read it.”"

Some were clearly real, but a surprising number couldn’t have been; they were too fantastic — elephants butchered in church basements, ordinary suburban parents gathered on the outskirts of town, in forests, to perform satanic rituals (though really, who wouldn’t thrill at the idea of one’s mother doing that while one slept?). A lot of the stories came from children, so one hesitated to call them “lies.” They were fictions. They were the great outrageous stories made up to express the more regular feelings of loss or disenchantment or anger."
Jenny Uglow’s ‘In These Times’,2015-01-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Jenny Uglow’s multifaceted history of the British home front during the Napoleonic wars.,"Most Americans probably have an indistinct idea of the warfare between Britain and France at the turn of the 19th century. So far as Britain is concerned, we are likely to recall that Admiral Nelson won a great victory in 1805 at Trafalgar, off the coast of Spain, and was mortally wounded during the battle. In words that became famous, he had signaled to his fleet, “England expects that every man will do his duty.” We are likelier to remember the Duke of Wellington’s triumph at Waterloo 10 years later, which ended Napoleon’s sensational career. A comment Wellington supposedly made afterward is also frequently quoted, that the engagement had been “a damned close-run thing.” And as a sidelight to the international conflict there was our own American War of 1812, during which Francis Scott Key was inspired to write his verses about the rockets’ red glare and bombs bursting in air.

"‘The Girl on the Train,’ by Paula Hawkins",2015-01-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A psychological thriller of intersecting lives and betrayals.,"Alfred Hitchcock may have said all there is to say about the fallibility of making assumptions about what you see through a window, but, like most important lessons, this one can bear some repeating. To the limited scope of a window frame, the former London journalist Paula Hawkins, in her debut thriller, “The Girl on the Train,” offers a few additional obfuscations. First, her novel’s protagonist, Rachel, looks out through the window of a moving train on her daily commute. Second, Rachel is your basic hot mess: depressed, unemployed, still in mourning for the death of her marriage and prone to alcoholic blackouts that coincide with critical moments in the tale of a missing woman later found dead. Rachel might as well be wearing a sign that reads “Unreliable Narrator.”"

Like thousands of their Lithuanian landsmen, Cohen’s relatives headed for the sunny, still-undeveloped, resource-­rich country of South Africa. In this new world they began with nothing, worked hard and achieved much. As is often true of successful immigrant families, their grandchildren could live as though the old world had never been. Cohen’s father became a doctor, his mother was college educated. Both were raised with the comforts that only numerous servants can provide: “They never had to boil an egg,” Cohen writes. Being a Jew in South Africa was not unlike being a Jew in the American South: Anti-Semitism was not absent, but it was greatly mitigated by a segregated black underclass all but legally enslaved."
"‘The Sacrifice,’ by Joyce Carol Oates",2015-01-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Joyce Carol Oates’s novel, a teenage girl is the alleged victim of a brutal rape.","Writing difference is a challenge, particularly in fiction. How do men write women and vice versa? How do writers of one race or ethnicity write about people of another race or ethnicity? More important, how do writers tackle difference without reducing their characters to caricatures or stereotypes? Some handle the challenge with aplomb. Bill Cheng’s “Southern Cross the Dog” and Louise Erdrich’s “The Round House” come to mind. Others fail: At one point in Kathryn Stockett’s “The Help,” a black woman compares her skin color with that of a cockroach. To write difference well demands empathy, an ability to respect the humanity of those you mean to represent. "

David Adam’s ‘The Man Who Couldn’t Stop’,2015-01-30,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder']","A guide to the science of obsessive-compulsive disorder, offered by a sufferer.","One cold Northern England evening in November 1990, when David Adam was a first-year college student in Leeds, he enjoyed an encouraging first date with a young woman that culminated in a bit of physical intimacy ending somewhere short of intercourse. The next day when a friend asked Adam if he had sex with the woman, he lied in the traditional manner of boastful, insecure young men everywhere and said that he had, without a condom. “You could have AIDS,” the friend said. That wasn’t true — or was, at most, exceedingly unlikely. Nevertheless, the idea lodged in Adam’s mind, where it set about establishing permanent residency. By the following summer, the fear that he might already have AIDS, or would someday contract it, had hijacked his brain. The “snowflake” of a single intrusive thought, as he puts it, had become a “blizzard” that “blew the snow into every corner of my mind, and laid down a blanket that muffled every surface.” For the next 20 years, Adam was consumed by the fear that he had contracted, or would contract, H.I.V.: He called the National AIDS Helpline so many times daily that the half-dozen staffers there came to recognize his voice; he got blood tests; he compulsively examined and re-examined every red stain he ever came across to determine whether it might be AIDS-tainted blood, and whether it might somehow have contaminated him. He knew this to be irrational — he was a science writer! — yet he couldn’t resist his compulsions. He had developed obsessive-compulsive disorder, or O.C.D."
