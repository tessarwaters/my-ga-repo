The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said in a statement released late Tuesday that eight years of effective bans on most exports, three major conflicts and tight restrictions on materials entering Gaza had “shattered its ability to export and produce for the domestic market, ravaged its already debilitated infrastructure, left no time for reconstruction and economic recovery, and accelerated the de-development” of the Gaza Strip. According to the agency, “Gaza’s 1.8 million inhabitants rely on coastal aquifers as their main source of freshwater, yet 95 percent of this water is not safe to drink.” Moreover, the unemployment rate exceeds 40 percent, and more than two-thirds of Gazans do not have reliable access to adequate supplies of food. A United Nations report in 2012 contained similar warnings, but it appears that widespread destruction caused by last summer’s conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants may have accelerated those trends. Israel and Egypt heavily restricted the movement of people and goods into Gaza after the militant Hamas group seized power of the territory in 2007. "

Instead, over the past few decades, historians have been extending their inquiries. Investigators who once understood the wartime massacres as a unique historical episode that mainly concerned Germans and Jews and was driven principally by ideology have increasingly produced comparative studies of regions and states, turning their attention to other victims and to what Eastern European archives are able to tell us about the dynamics of persecution and mass murder; economic issues; and the motivations of perpetrators, bystanders, women, religious and political leaders, neutrals, rescuers and others. So voluminous is this scholarly outpouring that few are able to keep up with it, although some historians continue to grapple with the subject as a whole. Notwithstanding all this effort, Timothy Snyder, a Yale University specialist in Eastern Europe, contends in “Black Earth” that our understanding of the Holocaust has failed us. We have misunderstood its lessons."

Is the Blue-Collar Shirt Still Blue Collar?,2015-09-03,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Labor and Jobs']","As the chambray shirt has evolved into a staple of casual style, its workingman’s identity has become a slippery social construct.","A work shirt is a dress shirt with a job to do. Accordingly, it is designed with buttonholes on its double pockets, stitched with an emphasis on strength and constructed from a sturdy material like khaki or covert or, most classically, a cotton called chambray. You can have a chambray shirt in any color you want, and if that color is blue, you also have a social construct and a rhetorical device: The shirt’s blue collar is a mass-­produced idea as durable and versatile as the garment itself. With blue-­collar identity now more a matter of cultural style than of occupational history, the term is perfectly slippery, such that the assertions that Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has ‘‘blue-­collar appeal’’ and an ‘‘anti-­union agenda’’ are not fundamentally incompatible. The phrase ‘‘blue collar’’ has flourished precisely because it is concrete in its imagery and vague in its connotations, vividly conjuring a labor-­class scene while sidestepping such a nasty word as ‘‘class.’’"

Colorado: Pro-Marijuana Activists Pull Back on Ballot Measure,2015-09-04,article,Brief,,"['Marijuana', 'Referendums', 'Law and Legislation']",Activists campaigning to allow the drug to be used legally in nightclubs or bars said they were withdrawing a measure to put the issue before voters in November.,"Pro-marijuana activists campaigning to allow the drug to be used legally in adults-only businesses like nightclubs or bars said on Thursday they were withdrawing a ballot measure that would have put the issue before voters in Denver in November. Activists said they were pulling the initiative because they believed they could reach a compromise with city  officials and business groups that would result in local legislation to allow some limited social use of marijuana in Denver. When Colorado voters in 2012 became the first in the nation, along with Washington State, to legalize marijuana for recreational use, they did so with a caveat: No public use. But advocates said the restrictions on public use were too strict and had prohibited marijuana everywhere except private homes and a handful of marijuana-friendly bed-and-breakfasts scattered around the state. The ballot proposal would have allowed people to eat edible marijuana or inhale vaporized forms of marijuana indoors, but would have relegated smoking to outdoor areas blocked from public view. Organizers said that it was still too early to know what might be included in a compromise ordinance, and that if the effort stalled, they might reintroduce the ballot measure next year. "

"‘A Clue to the Exit,’ by Edward St. Aubyn",2015-09-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Three passengers discuss life’s meaning in a novel within Edward St. Aubyn’s novel about a dying screenwriter.,"“Those of us who are dying,” Charlie Fairburn writes toward the end of this sparkling and morbid confession of a novel, “as opposed to those who are lounging around in their studies making dinner engagements, and then reluctantly disconnecting the phone for 20 minutes in order to browse through a medieval textbook and look up some realistic details — those of us who are really dying haven’t got time to ponder the past. The present is scintillating with horror and precision.”"
"‘The Wake,’ by Paul Kingsnorth",2015-09-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A novel about an Englishman undone by the Norman invasion is rendered in a devised Anglo-Saxon “shadow tongue.”,"What happens after the end? Since the portrayals of world-destroying deluges in early writings (“Gilgamesh,” the Matsya Purana, Genesis, the “Timaeus”), narratives of apocalypse have structured our understanding of time and history. Religious eschatology looks to the end of days as a prelude to the absolute finality of the kingdom of God. Secularized as “the Singularity,” a similar idea drives the imagination of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and cybernetic doomsayers, who believe we are approaching a technological punctum beyond which humanity as we know it will no longer exist. In the face of economic crisis and anxiety about climate change, postapocalyptic science fiction, long a genre staple, is undergoing one of its cyclical peaks of popularity. Our screens and pages are crowded with survivors, grimly coping with the aftermath of plagues, wars, natural disasters, zombie attacks and alien invasions."
"‘The Making of Asian America,’ by Erika Lee",2015-09-04,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Asian-Americans']",A historian broadens the focus on the experience of the very diverse Asian-American community.,"Early in Erika lee’s sweeping “The Making of Asian America: A History” she suggests that Asian-Americans constantly cycle between being labeled “good Asians” versus “bad Asians,” depending on the shifting and often contradictory politics behind their immigration and settlement. We were a “despised ­minority” when Asian immigrants threatened 19th- and early-20th-century white labor, yet since the Cold War we’ve been described as a “model minority,” valorizing the promise of American meritocracy. The capricious ease with which those labels get swapped highlights how our precarious social position rests on our perceived utility: as cheap labor, as anti-­Communist soldiers, as overachievers meant to ­success-shame other communities of ­color. In doing all of this “work,” Lee argues, Asian-­Americans have redefined not only immigration politics and racial categories but also “the very essence of what it means to be ­American.”"

At nightfall, amid the multitude, he spots a man who absorbs his attention. He decides to pursue him, until at last the sun begins to rise again and the narrator realizes that he has been following nothing but a man of the crowd — a man, the reader suspects, who mirrors the narrator in his banal pursuit of others and in his incapacity for being alone.

Inside the List,2015-09-04,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Louise Penny, whose novel “The Nature of the Beast” is No. 3 on the hardcover fiction list, once said: “I know that if I’m not in the top five on the Times best-seller list, I’m going to feel like a failure.”","The 11th Coming: “The Nature of the Beast,” Louise Penny’s 11th novel about the Québécois detective Armand Gamache, hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 3. Penny started the series in 2005 after two decades as a CBC radio host, and its popularity caught her by surprise. “It’s difficult to learn from success. I’ve learned more from my mistakes,” she told the author and critic Joel Yanofsky in 2013. “Fortunately, I’m capable of manufacturing my own problems.” In her 20s and early 30s those included a battle with alcoholism, and later a five-year bout of writer’s block that was, according to Yanofsky, “mainly spent watching Oprah, eating gummy bears and lying to everyone, including her husband, about how well her writing was going.” Things have improved since then. “Now I know that if I’m not in the top five on the Times best-seller list, I’m going to feel like a failure,” she said in the same interview. No worries here! But that doesn’t mean Penny’s life is challenge-free: In the past few years she’s had to care for her husband as he slides into dementia. “I find now that the writing is a safe harbor,” she told The Vancouver Sun last month. “It’s a place I go to that is mine.” You have to wonder if Penny had her husband’s condition in mind when she quoted Yeats’s “The Second Coming” in the new book — that’s the poem about things falling apart and the center not holding, which concludes, “And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?” Maybe. But mostly, Penny told The Sun, “the beast is ourselves.”"

What’s on TV Saturday,2015-09-05,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) WILD (2014) Reese Witherspoon, in an Oscar-nominated performance, portrays Cheryl Strayed, who copes with the aftermath of her heroin use, her marital infidelity and the death of her mother by hiking the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, spanning more than 1,000 miles, from the Southern California desert to the forests of Oregon. Her routine — walking, thinking, pitching her tent at night and packing it up in the morning — is punctuated by montages of memories and encounters in the wilderness, mostly with men. Some are scary; others are kind; but almost all are intrigued by the presence of a solitary woman so far from civilization. “ ‘Wild’ may be full of natural beauty — Yves Bélanger’s cinematography unostentatiously captures the infinite colors and vistas of the West — but it is also a celebration of the power of art,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Jean-Marc Vallée’s adaptation of Ms. Strayed’s memoir, from a script by Nick Hornby. And the film has its shortcomings, he added, with too much montage in the middle and too much voice-over at the end, and maybe not quite enough detail about some of Cheryl’s relationships. “But you wouldn’t want a movie that celebrates imperfection, improvisation and the importance of mistakes to be slick or seamless. What makes its heroine worth caring about — what makes her a rare and exciting presence in contemporary American film — is not that she’s tidy or sensible or even especially nice. It’s that she’s free.”"

What’s On TV Sunday,2015-09-06,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (13) ARTHUR & GEORGE In the time it took to puff on his pipe, Sherlock Holmes would have discerned everything: the eavesdropper at the private club, as well as his name, political persuasion and birthplace — all from the dust on his shoes. But Arthur Conan Doyle? Shockingly oblivious, a detractor declares in this three-part “Masterpiece Mystery!” presentation. “If you pursue your interest in the Edalji case, you’ll be judged by his high standards, and judged harshly,” the man chides Holmes’s creator. “But if you fall short, as you are bound to do, you’ll taint not only yourself but the world’s favorite consulting detective.” Edalji is the titular George, an Anglo-Indian solicitor imprisoned for mutilating livestock — and threatening schoolgirls with worse — in 1903 Staffordshire. He longs to be exonerated for crimes he maintains he did not commit, and Conan Doyle wagers his reputation that Edalji’s conviction was racially motivated. Martin Clunes, above, and Arsher Ali star in this adaptation of Julian Barnes’s fact-based novel, which unveils Conan Doyle’s personal life as he contemplates a future with his true love after his wife’s death. Charles Edwards plays Conan Doyle’s secretary, Alfred Wood — in other words, his Dr. Watson. “There’s just enough Sherlockian fun — Conan Doyle’s deductive abilities’ being compared unfavorably with those of his creation, Wood’s alarm when Conan Doyle considers a false beard as a disguise — to make the case for ‘Arthur & George,’ ” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times.

Mycale is Ayelet Rose Gottlieb, Sofia Rei, Sara Serpa and Malika Zarra — from Israeli, Argentine, Portuguese and Moroccan backgrounds — singing texts in Hebrew, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic, from the Hebrew Bible, Rumi, Fernando Pessoa, Heraclitus and elsewhere.

As reported in The New York Times, Anthony Hopkins, who starred, asked him to explain the play’s ending. Pinter’s response: “I don’t know. Just do it.” Pinter has since died, but his masterly and enigmatic dramas, as spare as his advice to actors, endure, although New York is perhaps due for a revival of “Old Times” (an acclaimed English production in 2013 starred Rufus Sewell).

In this new production, the Oscar nominee Clive Owen makes his Broadway debut opposite Eve Best (who starred in the Broadway revival of Pinter’s “The Homecoming”) and Kelly Reilly (“True Detective,” the Donmar Warehouse’s “After Miss Julie”). Douglas Hodge directs. (Previews start on Sept. 17, American Airlines Theater, roundabouttheatre.org.)"

Minotaur in His Maze ,2015-09-10,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",MacDonald ­Harris’s view of human identity as a kind of freak accident provides an undergirding structure of mystery to much of his work.,"No one, observing MacDonald ­Harris, would have taken him for a literary genius. He did not dress head to toe in black. He never posed for a photograph in a wrestling singlet, in Zen robes or atop a granite outcrop whose austere majesty was echoed by his windswept quiff. By September 1985, when I became his student and his friend, there was no hair at all to invite the wind’s attention. The luster of his pate gave his head the appearance of the polished ball end of some precision-­engineered chrome socket, or an observatory dome. You might have supposed that the mind inside that dome was busy working up new techniques of heat dissipation in airplane engines, but not new plots, new characters. He wore button-down shirts, tucked into jeans that were belted and pressed. His preferred footwear was the kind of tan hybrid of sneaker and Oxford shoe favored by Elderhostelers. Sometimes, it is true, he would wear a floppy-brimmed bucket hat and a funny kind of jacket, vaguely suggestive of an interest in trout fishing or photo safaris. But — as with the high, lustrous cranial dome — if you saw him in his goofy hat and jacket, you would have been less likely to think, “There goes a literary innovator gifted with an original and unfettered artistic imagination” than “There goes a chemical engineer who enjoys cultivating succulents.”"

Both worked hard and succeeded against long odds, defying convention on the way to making a real impact on the world. Each honed her craft and rose to prominence in 1920s Paris, but they had little in common, background-wise or personality-wise: The down-to-earth yet flamboyant Schiaparelli came from a cultured, well-off Italian family, the theatrical but restrained Chanel from a dirt-poor French one. The two women developed a tense rivalry, capped off by their choices during World War II, when Schiaparelli did relief work for the French and trained as a Red Cross nurse’s aide, while Chanel became a Nazi agent. So it’s fitting that two new books intended to plant their life stories in the imaginations of a new generation, “Hot Pink: The Life and Fashions of Elsa Schiaparelli” and “Coco and the Little Black Dress,” take completely different approaches."

Invariably, at least one student evaluation will complain that ‘‘Professor Baptist only talks about slavery.’’ It’s an annual reminder that while I’ve been trying to teach the history of slavery for two decades in American classrooms, America has tried to evade thinking about that history for far longer.

Inside the List,2015-09-11,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"Jonathan Franzen’s “Purity,” No. 2 on the hardcover fiction list, includes a riff about the “plague of literary Jonathans.”","The Plague: Is there any way, at this point, to separate Jonathan Franzen’s work from his polarizing public image? Most readers will recall that Franzen’s fame problem began in 2001, when he openly squirmed after Oprah Winfrey picked his novel “The Corrections” for her book club, then escalated through no real fault of his own when media outlets (including The Times) hailed his 2010 follow-up, “Freedom,” as a masterpiece. Both were best sellers, but they also fostered an enthusiastic backlash among people who objected less to Franzen’s writing than to Franzen himself, as an emblem of literary ambition and elitism. (Laura Miller put her finger on this in a recent essay for The New Yorker’s website: “Franzen’s persona,” she wrote, “has its own audience, one that seems to derive great pleasure from hating it. Although his fiction is the occasion of his fame, it is now no longer necessary to have read any of it to have an opinion about Franzen.”)"

Bill Walker’s expansion order.,"Alaska expanded federal Medicaid coverage after the state’s highest court on Monday refused an appeal by the State Legislature to halt Gov. Bill Walker’s expansion order. Mr. Walker, an independent, said that the expansion could save the state about $100 million and bring 20,000 or more residents into health care coverage, and that he did not need legislative approval. The Republican-controlled Legislature, in filing a lawsuit and seeking a temporary restraining order, said Mr. Walker had violated the State Constitution’s separation of powers provisions. The expansion will, among other changes, increase federal reimbursement to 100 percent from 50 percent for medically necessary travel for Medicaid-eligible Alaska Natives and American Indians receiving care in Indian Health Service facilities, which is a major medical expense and care concern in rural Alaska. The Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision, issued last week, not to halt the plan while the Legislature’s lawsuit proceeds. "

In the next sentence, however, Didion tells the story of her 7-year-old daughter, who, on seeing one of O’Keeffe’s sublime “Sky Above Clouds” paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, runs toward it and whispers: “Who drew it? . . . I need to talk to her.” The longing to corroborate one’s own feelings with the facts of an artist’s life — the assumption “that the glory she saw in the work reflected a glory in its maker” — is a primal one, Didion suggests. But there is a paradox inherent in the encounter with art: Even as it may touch us acutely, it is essentially mysterious. It carries only a trace of its maker, and this is style. “Style is character,” Didion declares, throwing down the gauntlet: Find me if you can."
"‘The Story of My Teeth,’ by Valeria Luiselli",2015-09-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A playful novel shaped by inventive collaborations.,"On its not-so-placid surface, Valeria Luiselli’s second novel is the tale of a guy named Gustavo (Highway) Sánchez Sánchez, who auctions off his old teeth, claiming they are from the mouths of Plato, Montaigne, Virginia Woolf and Borges, among others. Then he takes his profits and buys a set of teeth that supposedly belonged to Marilyn Monroe, implanting them in his own mouth. After that, things go well for a while until Highway’s son, Siddhartha, knocks him out and steals Monroe’s teeth, leaving his dad chopperless. Eventually Highway runs into a man named Voragine (an abyss?) who helps him, and who later appears to be the person telling this story. Along the way, the names of Proust, Unamuno, Foucault, Walser, Cortázar and Raymond Roussel burst out of random paragraphs like startled grouse."

Review: ‘Available Light’ Takes Over an Armory at Philadelphia’s Fringe Festival,2015-09-13,article,Review,,"['Dancing', 'Festivals']","This revival of a work choreographed by Lucinda Childs and scored by John Adams, with a set by Frank Gehry, mines a breathtaking spectrum of kaleidoscopic patterns.","In the midst of an extensive European tour, “Available Light,” a 1983 collaboration among the choreographer Lucinda Childs, the composer John Adams and the architect Frank Gehry, made an American stop over the weekend. Presented by FringeArts in Philadelphia as part of the 2015 Fringe Festival, the work took over the Drexel University Armory, a space vast enough to accommodate its grand if minimalist proportions. Ms. Childs was among the revolutionaries of Judson Dance Theater in the 1960s, and like some of her fellow postmodernists she has found a more ardent audience — and more funding, presumably — in Europe than in the United States. But as the writer Suzanne Carbonneau notes in a program essay, Philadelphia has been good to her, with the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage supporting the reconstruction of her early works and giving them a handsome online platform, the exemplary archival project “A Steady Pulse: Restaging Lucinda Childs, 1963-78.” You can enjoy that from anywhere."

It eventually became one of the most beloved, too, and one of the biggest moneymakers. Emma Thompson is the author P. L. Travers, who conjured the magical nanny and is something of a crank. “I won’t have her turned into one of your silly cartoons,” she says of her creation, lips pursed. There’s a back story, too, in which Travers is a little girl (Annie Rose Buckley) in a dusty Australian town, where her hopelessly alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) can barely hold on to his bank job. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this movie “part of the Disney brand, of course: fun for everyone, with a spoonful of therapeutic medicine to help the sugar seem nutritious.” (Image: From left, Lily Bigham, Ms. Buckley, Ruth Wilson and Mr. Farrell.)"

Of course for them, the phrase would have been transmitted insularly, from one to another, as a reminder of how much was riding upon their success at not merely performing gentility but also believing in the inviolable dignity that gentility has always been thought to confer.

"‘Finale,’ by Thomas Mallon",2015-09-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This novel of the Reagan years shows how the 40th president dominated those around him without revealing himself.,"Readers of “Finale,” Thomas Mallon’s sly and penetrating ninth novel, are well aware that the book’s protagonist, the nation’s 40th president, is destined to be revered as the Republican Party’s patron saint, his very name synonymous with conservative virtue. However, none of the novel’s characters know this in real time. “Finale” takes place primarily in 1986, two years after Ronald Reagan’s final triumphant campaign and two years before he vacates the White House for good. His presidential legacy is on the line, and the events of 1986 — a fateful nuclear arms meeting in Reykjavik with Mikhail Gorbachev and the brewing Iran-contra scandal — threaten to undo it. The sense of foreboding, bordering at times on panic, that pervades this work of historical fiction stands as an arresting contrast to today’s notion of the unassailable Teflon president."

I’ve never met this person, and I know him to have been a diligent student who won a prestigious fellowship during senior year. He would probably be a leading candidate, and by passing his résumé on, I would be implicitly giving my stamp of approval. The problem is that freshman year he sexually harassed and attempted to sexually assault a good friend of mine. A third party intervened before it escalated and brought her to me and another friend. She decided not to take the incident to any authority, and she eventually worked through the experience. The thought of working with the man who brought so much pain to a good friend is hard to swallow, but I do not know what the ethical thing to do is. It is not my story to share, and I do not want to bring the question to my friend for fear of opening old wounds. Am I allowed to share this information with the head of human resources?

Patrick deWitt’s ‘Undermajordomo Minor’,2015-09-17,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A tale of mystery, adventure, romance and quest, with an oddball detour.","What does it mean to say that a writer has a “take” on a genre? This question has been popping around my mind since I read Patrick deWitt’s new novel, “Undermajordomo Minor,” which is, let’s just say this straight out, quick and funny and thoughtful and moving and super. But what else is it? The book feels like a take on a certain genre — and let’s figure out what the genre is in a minute — but I’m suspicious of that phrasing, a take, which is often used to draw a divisive line. It is said, for instance, that Margaret Atwood does a take on science fiction and therefore is a literary writer instead of a science fiction writer, and then we wonder why there are so few science fiction writers who write as well as Margaret Atwood, while the science fiction writers glare at us and order another round. This is bad. “The Handmaid’s Tale” is science fiction and should not be disqualified as such on the grounds that it has good sentences and makes you think, as does the work of Patrick deWitt.

It’s important to realize that it matters not at all whether the overall rate is slightly positive or slightly negative; as the IMF says, “lowflation” creates all the problems we associate with deflation, even if the headline number is greater than zero."

What’s On TV Friday,2015-09-18,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) FURY (2014) An American tank crew — its leader, Sgt. Don Collier (Brad Pitt), a.k.a. Wardaddy, and his motley crew (Michael Peña, Jon Bernthal, Shia LaBeouf and Logan Lerman) — fights its way across Germany in the spring of 1945 as the Nazis retreat toward Berlin in Hitler’s suicidal last stand. Children are conscripted and uncooperative parents murdered. And while the Allies may have momentum, the Germans still have plenty of tanks, many superior to the Americans’. David Ayer, whose drama is less an epic than a series of tense episodes, “has a way of filming violence that is both intense and matter-of-fact,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Like many other post-‘Saving Private Ryan’ combat movies, this one emphasizes the chaotic immediacy of battle, staking its claim to authenticity on the unflinching depiction of bloodshed: Heads are vaporized by mortar rounds. Limbs are severed by bursts of automatic-rifle fire. Human flesh is charred by flames and shredded by shrapnel. But within this gore-spattered, superficially nihilistic carapace is an old-fashioned platoon picture, a sensitive and superbly acted tale of male bonding under duress.” (Image: Mr. Lerman, left, and Mr. Pitt.)"

A good song is a good song.”","Female Acts: Chrissie Hynde’s rock ’n’ roll memoir, “Reckless,” about life as the lead singer of the Pretenders, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 7, taking its place in a wave of recent titles from the women of rock: Patti Smith’s “Just Kids,” which won the 2010 National Book Award, spent 46 weeks on the hardcover and paperback lists; Kim Gordon’s “Girl in a Band” logged a month this year; and Jewel’s “Never Broken” has just been released. Books are also on the way from Carrie Brownstein, Sinead O’Connor and others. “This is the era of the female act,” the former Rolling Stone editor (and current president of Blue Rider Press) David Rosenthal told The Washington Post this month. “Maybe that has caused overall a hunger for reading about female artists.” Maybe it has. But Hynde told The Post that gender isn’t a big part of the equation for her. “A good book is a good book. A good song is a good song,” she said. “Let me hear it, let me read it. I’m not very gender-driven.” Hynde grew up in a fairly conservative family in Akron, Ohio, and managed, apparently, to hide the more lurid elements of her rock ’n’ roll lifestyle from her mother and father. “I couldn’t have told this when my parents were alive,” she writes in a brief prologue to the memoir. “I would have had to leave out the bad language and tell a lot of lies about what I’d been doing all that time I was gone.”"

But she gets much of her inspiration and source material from far outside jazz. Not from pop or classical music or avant-garde traditions. But from music that she has to travel great distances to learn about, like Southern Taiwanese folk songs; or pansori, the South Korean musical storytelling tradition; or sindhenan, the improvisational singing of Javanese gamelan music. (A lot of the music she’s looking for has something to do with her own background: raised in Illinois, her parents are from Taiwan and East Timor.)

In “The Lost Landscape: A Writer’s Coming of Age,” she repeatedly ex­presses her doubts about first-person autobio­graphical writing. For one thing, she’s deeply wary of the confessional voice. For another, she has little faith in the reliability of memory. While she can vouch for the accuracy of “A Widow’s Story,” her 2011 account of the aftermath of her first husband’s death, which she based on contemporaneous journals, she can hardly back up this latest memoir with documentation. No small child, not even a Joyce Carol Oates, could be expected to take notes all day.

1915: German Armies Occupy Vilna,2015-09-20,article,News,,"['Defense and Military Forces', 'World War I (1914-18)']",From the International Herald Tribune archives: The capital of Lithuania is taken by the German army in 1915.,"Vilna, capital of the Government of that name and the biggest city of Lithuania, has been occupied by the Germans. Details of the city’s fall have not yet been made known, but there is every reason to suppose that the Russian army of occupation has withdrawn intact. For the last few days, as the HERALD indicated yesterday, the fate of Vilna had been in the balance. The enemy occupying Molodetchno and Vidsy, Vilna was practically cut off from all railway communication, and its evacuation, generally regarded as imminent, had doubtless been fully prepared for by the Russian high command. The fall of Vilna, says the “Times” Petrograd correspondent, will facilitate a further German advance along the northern routes and will increase Russia’s difficulties in the matter of transport, both of men and munitions. No official Russian statement has yet been issued, but even the German newspapers do not suggest that the army defending Vilna has been captured. Its escape may therefore be taken for granted, but its position is still a somewhat dangerous one, for an important enemy force threatens its flank from the east. — The New York Herald, European Edition, September 21, 1915"

One of the last sustainable industries is the prison system. “Prisons used to be about punishment, and then reform and penitence, and then keeping dangerous offenders inside. Then, for quite a few decades, they were about crowd control — penning up the young, aggressive, marginalized guys to keep them off the streets. And then, when they started to be run as private businesses, they were about the profit margins for the prepackaged jail-meal suppliers and the hired guards and so forth.”"

And “Watergate” (2012) is a tough act to follow. It’s a shockingly glamorous immersion in the Washington of the Nixon years, with a vast array of characters and a beautifully oblique way of maneuvering them. It makes no difference what knowledge of the Nixon presidency you bring to this marvel of a book. Mr. Mallon has found surprising perspectives from which to look at it and a way of siphoning emphasis away from the turf already trampled by historians.

Both tell the story of a marriage first from the husband’s somewhat complacent perspective, then change course midway to reveal a wife far more active and vengeful than expected. But “Fates and Furies” is also, as the title suggests, a meditation on classical ideas of destiny and human agency, with the golden boy Lotto (short for Lancelot) representing submission to the Fates while his wife, Mathilde, rides with the Furies and shapes reality to her liking. I asked Groff which view she endorses, if either. “I wobble between action and somewhat optimistic fatalism,” she replied by email. “In the middle of the night, I side more with Ma­thilde’s pragmatic anxiety; during the slow, hot Florida daylight hours, I’m a little sunnier, a little more like Lotto. I thought, going into the book, that I was 89 percent Lotto, and this book is in some ways an elaborate apologia to my husband for often being wrapped up in my writing to the exclusion of actual life. But Mathilde is a terrifying sister of my heart, and I find myself in her in equal measure. It’s not exactly Flaubert’s ‘Madame Bovary, c’est moi.’ In truth both Lotto and Mathilde, c’est moi. I am both of them and neither of them in equal measure, and their lives and ambivalence and desires have elements of mine, all snarled up in this one big wild knot.”"

What’s on TV Saturday,2015-09-26,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) UNBROKEN (2014) Angelina Jolie descends from the heavens into hell in this tale about Louis Zamperini (Jack O’Connell), the Olympic track star turned World War II hero, who survived a plane crash in the Pacific in 1943 and drifted for nearly seven weeks on a life raft before being imprisoned and tortured by the Japanese for two years. Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson condensed Laura Hillenbrand’s 2010 best seller, “Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption,” which covers the first 25 years or so of Mr. Zamperini’s life, into a 2-hour-17-minute screenplay. That’s still hardly enough time to cover each chapter in his life, and though Ms. Jolie does fine work throughout, the strain shows. Her “tendency to go David Lean in this material works against her,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “What the movie ends up in desperate need of is a sense of life made real and palpable through dreadful, transporting details, not a life embalmed in hagiographic awe.”"

But her efforts to find him place her in a terrible dilemma: either betray the code of silence that keeps her clan proudly on the wrong side of the law or face destitution.

By turns he is frightened, terrified, alarmed, filled with dread. On one occasion he shudders in his core; mostly he is just plain worried. What concerns him, a concern he is eager to transmit to us, is the rapid spread of computer, Internet and telephone technologies and more specifically what those technologies are doing to our minds. Forever glued to screens of one kind or another, clicking compulsively on the links others provide for us, we are losing the ability to concentrate, growing more itchy and agitated by the day, allowing our consciousness to be fragmented and dispersed. Our very selfhood is under threat as we are invited to think of achievement as a collective, rather than individual goal, a contribution to Wikipedia rather than a distinctive personal statement. At every step the Internet or GPS navigator puts us at a remove from the world and from our fellow human beings, deprives us of the agency we enjoyed when we had to go out and find things for ourselves rather than have them suggested to us. “Rewired,” as neuroscientists have now demonstrated, to adapt to the fitful back and forth of the web, our brains are no longer fit for the sustained attention that literature requires. Fewer young people are choosing to study the humanities. Fewer great works of art are being produced. There is a real risk of individuality being submerged in system. To make matters worse, a vast majority of people seem entirely happy with this state of affairs, to the point that anyone questioning the value of the new technologies is immediately deemed a Luddite if not a dinosaur.

What’s On TV Tuesday,2015-09-29,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Flix) VENUS (2006) The elderly actor Maurice (Peter O’Toole, in an Oscar-nominated performance) takes an interest in Jessie (Jodie Whittaker), the great-niece of his friend Ian (Leslie Phillips), who has arrived in London to care for her great-uncle — and perhaps break into modeling. Ian is horrified by Jessie’s working-class habits. Maurice, on the other hand, sees in her a target for his charm. “Their unlikely, uneven friendship provides the movie with a thin, wobbly dramatic peg, but it turns out to be just enough for Mr. O’Toole to show the younger guys out there — the Leos and the Brads and, for that matter, the Daniel Craigs — how the thing is done properly,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this meditation on age and beauty, directed by Roger Michell and based on a screenplay by Hanif Kureishi. In “Dirty Pretty Things” (2002), at 9:35, Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays a Nigerian doctor on the run who discovers an organ-smuggling ring while working illegally as a hotel porter in London. Audrey Tautou is his Turkish roommate, who pines for him. “ ‘Dirty Pretty Things’ plays it straight and cool,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times about this Stephen Frears drama. He added, “After watching Mr. Frears ply his refined skills in mainstream studio fare, it’s enthralling to see him employ that jazziness to spark his ticking impatience with injustice.” (Image: Mr. O’Toole and Ms. Whittaker.)"

Niall Ferguson’s ‘Kissinger.

Recent History,2015-09-30,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"A graphic novel set in the 1970s shows a kind of childhood long gone, but not so long ago.","Middle-grade readers today are part of what’s becoming known as Generation Z, born between 1996 and 2011 (give or take a year or so on either end). As this newspaper has noted, they have by now their own generational sensibility: more Lorde than Lady Gaga, more Snapchat than Facebook. Growing up entirely in a digital era, they are more private, sensible and cautious than their Millennial elders. Perhaps that’s because they are being raised not by high-flying boomers but by Generation X, which one Times article calls “a relatively small, jaded generation that came of age in the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam funk of the 1970s, when horizons seemed limited.” Much of the current helicopter-parenting phenomenon, it has been speculated, is a result of these Gen-Xers overcorrecting with their offspring for the strange and often jarring empty spaces that characterized their own 1970s childhoods. Back then, I think it is safe to say, “parenting” as a verb — a life-defining, life-consuming activity — had not been invented, even as the world had become more treacherous for children to navigate. It seems appropriate, then, that one of the best books I have yet read about growing up in the 1970s is a graphic novel for middle-grade readers: “Sunny Side Up,” by Jennifer L.

The Pre-Aged Genius of Bill Withers,2015-09-30,article,News,,['Music'],Paying tribute to the master of well-seasoned soul.,"“I’m not going to let anybody con me out of being an old guy,” Bill Withers told The Times in an interview earlier this month. Now 77, the recent Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee was referring to the fact that he didn’t feel under any pressure to make new music. But even at the peak of his career, Withers was, in a sense, old.

Here, finally, is a recording of this epically proportioned forgotten treasure, written in 1927 in Philadelphia by Ornstein, a Ukrainian-born piano virtuoso and composer who died in 2002 at the age of 108. Ornstein goes for the jugular in the febrile outer movements, shot through with Russian folk material and rhythmic fire, but offers respite in the achingly tender Andante Lamentoso. His nervous, simmering String Quartet No. 2, written around 1929, is another interesting document of Ornstein’s late Romantic style, but it’s the Quintet that now ought to be picked up by intrepid performers and presenters and given its due in the chamber music canon.
