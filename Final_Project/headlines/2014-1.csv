Diving Into the Wreck,2014-01-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Chang-rae Lee’s new novel imagines a future after the breakdown of society.,"Watching a talented writer take a risk is one of the pleasures of devoted reading, and “On Such a Full Sea” provides all that and more. It’s a wonderful addition not only to Chang-rae Lee’s body of work but to the ranks of “serious” writers venturing into the realm of dystopian fantasy. Colson Whitehead, Cormac McCarthy and Margaret Atwood (in her recently concluded MaddAddam trilogy) have all tackled this genre. Doris Lessing’s “Mara and Dann” is a classic, as is Anthony Burgess’s “Clockwork Orange.” Further back in time, one has only to think of Orwell, Huxley and Wells, even Jack London and Mary Shelley. As the author of such carefully realist fiction as “Native Speaker” and “A Gesture Life,” Lee has always been preoccupied by the themes of hope and betrayal, by the tensions that arise in small lives in the midst of great social change. His marvelous new book, which imagines a future after the breakdown of our own society, takes on those concerns with his customary mastery of quiet detail — and a touch of the fantastic."
Mr. Shteyngart’s Planet,2014-01-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A son’s story of moving from Leningrad to Queens with parents unburdened by any understanding of American life.,"Early in his hilarious and moving memoir, Gary Shteyngart reveals that his mother’s post-collegiate nickname for him is Little Failure, which would seem more insulting if his father didn’t already call him Snotty. In this Russian Jewish family — the Shteyngarts moved from Leningrad to Queens in 1979, when Gary was 7 — barbed jokes, or shutki, are tokens of love: weird, hostile tokens, but tokens nonetheless. The shutki continue to fly in Shteyngart’s direction even after — or maybe especially after — he becomes a successful novelist (“The Russian Debutante’s Handbook,” “Absurdistan,” “Super Sad True Love Story”). Treating his parents to dinner at the revolving restaurant atop the Marriott Marquis to celebrate his mother’s birthday, Shteyngart is a sitting duck as his father fires off this one: “I read on the Russian Internet that you and your novels will soon be forgotten.” While that may not sound exactly like a joke, it’s riotous compared with what he tells his son at another dinner: “I burn with a black envy toward you. I should have been an artist as well.”"

The plan for one, La Coupole, a sports arena in Algiers, which can be seen in the slide show here, was made on a napkin. Mekki Damerdji, an architect and professor in Algiers, says Mentouri University (shown here), in the city of Constantine, is a favorite of his for its stark contrast to the more traditional buildings that dominate the country’s landscape. “We’re not used to seeing this shape in our country,” Damerdji says. “We haven’t anything like this in Algeria.

What’s On Saturday,2014-01-04,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) ADMISSION (2013) Tina Fey (above, seated) portrays Portia Nathan, a Princeton admissions officer who seems to take a special kind of glee in controlling the fate of applicants aspiring to the university’s ivy-covered halls. She also has a goal of her own: to succeed the retiring dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn) and beat out her office rival (Gloria Reuben) while reclaiming Princeton’s place at the top of the U.S. News & World Report rankings. But just as her smug English-professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen) dumps her for an aggressive Virginia Woolf scholar (Sonya Walger), a fellow Dartmouth alum (Paul Rudd) comes along with an unusual student (Nat Wolff) he wants Portia to consider. “How could anyone make light of the brutal, capricious system by which our young people are judged and sorted?” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this comedy from Paul Weitz, adapted from the novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz. “And I must confess that I don’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed that ‘Admission,’ which had the potential to be a sharp, satirical jab at the soft belly of middle-class anxiety, chose instead to be a warm and wacky fable of wish fulfillment. Mr. Weitz lines up a target placed at the explosive intersection of class, race, region and every other source of societal anguish, and then does not so much miss as aim in another direction — or several — letting fly a volley of darts that land as lightly as badminton birdies.” Still, Ms. Fey and Mr. Rudd “are fun to watch, though not as much fun as they might have been in a riskier, crazier movie,” he said, adding that “the best scenes belong to Lily Tomlin, brilliantly cast as Portia’s mother, an unbowed second-wave woman warrior with a pair of borzois and a Bella Abzug tattoo.”"

Do Animals Have a Sweet Tooth?,2014-01-04,article,News,,"['Artificial Sweeteners', 'Sugar', 'Taste']",Some animals appear to like sugar but have no response to artificial sweeteners.,"No preference is so quick to form, and none so hard to lose, as a baby’s love for sweets. Give a newborn a drop of sugar water when he’s hours old, and he’ll suckle. At a dental school in Jerusalem in the early 1970s, a scientist named Jacob E. Steiner doled out sucrose to 175 infants before they’d had a drop of mother’s milk and saw clear signs of satisfaction: The babies showed “a marked relaxation of the facial muscle,” he wrote, and “a retraction of the mouth’s angles resembling a ‘smile.’ ” Then he tried the same experiment on several babies born without a cerebral cortex and found the same result. The joy of sugar needs no cogitation; it scarcely needs a brain."

What’s on Sunday,2014-01-05,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (13, 49) DOWNTON ABBEY A fourth round of the writer Julian Fellowes’s sudsy British hit about aristocrats and their servants begins as Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) mourns the death of her husband, Matthew, who was killed on the day of the birth of their baby, George, at the end of last season. But Mary finds motherhood to be scant solace, and Matthew’s death has left the estate’s financial future shaky, since he apparently did not leave a will. Meanwhile, Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) appears to have at long last found love with the editor Michael Gregson (Charles Edwards); Lady Rose (Lily James), the niece of the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), stirs things up with her newfound fondness for jazz and her particular appreciation for the singer Jack Ross (Gary Carr); and Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton) struggles with her place in the family, now that her son Matthew is no longer in the picture. (Sophie McShera, as Daisy, is above.) “The narrative this time around is even more stretched, derivative and repetitive than Season 3’s, but almost ingeniously so: It is both utterly predictable and surprisingly addictive,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “ ‘Downton Abbey’ is long past its sell-by date, yet is still remarkably palatable.”"

He has no choice, though: Responding to the history of one’s times is the sworn duty of a character in a novel by E. L. Doctorow, who has in his half-century of writing fiction placed a remarkable number of people, both real and imagined, in their history just to watch them respond. At first Andrew, whose time is the bewilderingly eventful opening decade of this century, doesn’t sound like much of a witness: A self-­described “freakishly depressive cognitive scientist klutz,” he seems far more interested in the workings of his own mind than those of the world outside, and for a long time speaks — to someone he calls Doc — only of his messy private life and his largely fruitless research into the mysteries of the human brain. He cracks cynical jokes, tells parts of his life story in the third person, indulges in a fair bit of glib self-analysis (“I am finally, terribly, unfeeling”) and generally plays the fool. “Andrew’s Brain” is cunning. It isn’t hard to figure out that Andrew is an unreliable narrator, but by the end of this sly book Doctorow has you wondering if there’s any other kind."

Beyond Beefcake in the Work of a Gay Pioneer,2014-01-09,article,Review,,"['Art', 'Photography']","“Devotion,” an exhibition at New York University’s 80WSE, shows a surprising range in the work by Bob Mizer, known for his erotic photographs of men.","In 1951, Bob Mizer began Physique Pictorial, a magazine loaded with photographs of muscular young men wearing little more than posing straps — G-strings for men. Its imagery ostensibly illustrated health and fitness, but was really aimed at what was then an underground gay market. Mizer (1922-92) was a pioneer in making explicit the genre’s erotic appeal, enough so to attract attention from legal authorities. In 1947, he was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor by taking nude pictures of a 17-year-old, and he spent a year in prison. In 1954, he was convicted of distributing obscene material through the mail. (That conviction was reversed on appeal a couple of years later.) Those speed bumps didn’t stop Mizer’s enterprise as a commercial photographer and publisher from growing to the point at which it occupied four lots near downtown Los Angeles, like a Hollywood movie studio, earning him the nickname “the Hugh Hefner of gay publishing.” Mizer, evidently, was blessedly free of high-art pretension, but Physique Pictorial was nevertheless an inspiration for artists like David Hockney and Robert Mapplethorpe.

While many of these works have been destroyed, and others forgotten, some are now recognized as significant works of art, accorded a special place in history and in an artist’s body of work, in part because they can bring us closer to understanding the mysterious process of painting, and, indeed, to painting’s future.

But its journey concludes on a positive note, even if the film itself does not. On second thought, the film can be a little ambivalent in that department."

The Music Gene,2014-01-10,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Richard Powers’s novel, a composer’s experiment with sound and microbiology attracts the attention of Homeland Security.","Is it premature to talk of the “Powers Problem”?

At his current age of 56, he is, as a novelist, midway on life’s path; presumably he has another 11 or so novels still in him. Powers has won a National Book Award and has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; he has been the recipient of a MacArthur “genius grant”; he has elicited lavish praise from the critics — most of them, anyway. Two of the words most frequently employed in connection with his literary output are “cerebral” and “ambitious.” “Cerebral” refers to his tendency to lace his novels with scientific and scholarly themes, like artificial intelligence in “Galatea 2.2,” game theory in “Prisoner’s Dilemma” and musicology cum genetic recombination in “The Gold Bug Variations.” “Ambitious” refers to his penchant for fashioning narrative structures and symbolic networks on a heroic scale."

By 1954, when the action of the novel begins, Vienna has witnessed not only the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but the Anschluss and Hitler’s reign of terror against the Jewish population, as well as repeated bombings during World War II and simultaneous occupation by four victorious foreign powers. Written during the late 1950s, “The Exiles Return” has an immediacy that makes de Waal’s readers feel the experiences of its characters in a visceral way."

Trudging along in this Lear-like existence — “Wintertime, Jesus Christ, he lived like a bear” — he’s taken by surprise by the ebullient Cadillac, a remarkable young woman from the Solomon Islands who comes to stay with him before studying medicine at Yale. (Thirty years prior, stationed in the Solomons during the Second World War, Jim befriended Cadillac’s father, with whom he has since lost all contact.) If this premise sounds familiar — striking young woman brings hope to forsaken old man — the style with which Greenway weaves her tale of memory and loss is bracing in its restraint."

"Dear Sasha, Dear Volodya",2014-01-10,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In a postmodern Russian epistolary novel, two lovers are separated both by distance and by time.","Contemporary Russia is short on pleasant surprises, but one is its formidable audience not only for the trashy novels prohibited by the Soviets but also for aggressively untraditional work. In the West, the phrase “Russian literature” typically conjures standard-bearers of ­realism — Tolstoy, Chekhov — but perhaps modern Russia is too real for realism.

E. B. Griffin (“Hazardous Duty,” No. 3) and Jack Higgins (“The Death Trade,” No. 11). Higgins is well known for his audacious story lines: His 1975 breakthrough, “The Eagle Has Landed,” concerned a Nazi plot to kidnap Churchill, while his 1989 best seller “A Season in Hell” imagined smugglers transporting heroin in the corpses of drowning victims. By those lights, “The Death Trade” — about a nuclear scientist forced to work for the Iranian government — seems almost workaday. Higgins’s eating habits are less colorful. “I’m notorious for liking very simple food,” he told Virgin Media in 2000. “You can take me to some of the world’s top restaurants and I’ll leave half of it on the plate. Food is not hugely important to me.” That’s not to say Higgins never dines out — a restaurant near his home in the Channel Islands doubles as his office, he explained in the same interview. “I go in at lunchtime, do two hours’ work, and then I eat,” he said. “And then in the evening I’ll go in and do three hours and then I’ll eat. I’ll write by hand and I get so absorbed it doesn’t bother me if the place is full or the music’s playing. It’s very common, particularly at night, for the waiters to come up and say, ‘Look, it’s 10 o’clock and you haven’t had anything to eat yet.’ ”"

It signals a bold departure from both the carefully observed realism that distinguished Mr. Lee’s powerful earlier books “Aloft” (2004) and “A Gesture Life” (1999) — and the historical vistas of “The Surrendered” (2010). In eschewing one of his most potent gifts as a writer — his ability to map the inner lives of his characters with sympathy and precision — Mr. Lee has produced an ungainly and strangely inert novel. Instead of creating a palpably real flesh-and-blood heroine, he has chosen to center his book on an anime-like character named Fan; and instead of creating a fully imagined fictional realm (as Kazuo Ishiguro did in his bravura sci-fi-like novel, “Never Let Me Go,” from 2005), he’s dropped Fan into a futuristic world that seems at once overly familiar and unconvincing."

Raf Simons’s Colorful Collaboration With Sterling Ruby for Fall/Winter 2014,2014-01-16,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Paris Fashion Week']","The Belgian designer teamed up with the American artist, an old friend, to design a one-off collection under a new label.","Last night, the Belgian designer Raf Simons and the Los Angeles artist Sterling Ruby presented their collaborative fall/winter 2014 collection in a gutted raw space just off the Place Vendome in Paris. “We have done the whole thing together,” Simons said backstage about creating the label Raf Simons/Sterling Ruby with his friend of nine years. The two met through a gallerist when Simons first purchased a piece of Ruby’s art, and collaborated several years ago on a capsule collection of denim jeans and jackets. For this one-off set of designs for the label, which was presented in place of Simons’s eponymous line, Ruby decked out the runway with his signature large-scale sculptures. Shaped like red-white-and-blue fangs dripping from the ceilings, the artwork set the scene for the colorful clothes: khaki trench coats artfully appliquéd with brightly colored fabric strips and various articles emblazoned with words like “father” and “Abu Lang,” which Ruby explained stood for the phrase “abusive language.” “We loaded a lot of things into the clothing, both in terms of iconography and also our own path,” Ruby added. The pieces spattered with color were the most literal references to their craft — a real artist’s wardrobe."

There will be a funeral, hosted by his family.

It’s the 25th book in her “Dark” series of paranormal romances, about a race of shape-shifters called the Carpathians — basically, kindhearted vampires who refuse to kill humans and often have energetic, soul-trembling sex with them. Feehan discovered her calling while she was still in middle school; speaking with the romance website RBL Romantica early in her career, she remembered sitting in math class and working on her first steamy love scene until the teacher confiscated her notebook. “You should have seen his face,” she said. “I was about 13 at the time. I don’t know which of us was more mortified.” But despite her early start she delayed publishing for a long time, working more than 20 years as a martial arts instructor (she has a third-degree black belt in karate) and writing for herself while she and her husband raised 11 children. “I can write with the entire household around me most of the time,” she told another website in 2002. “My husband reads all my books and had better love them — and if he doesn’t, he’d better lie like crazy with a smile on his face.

Austin City Limits,2014-01-17,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A con man hides out at a famous writing program in this satiric novel.,"Feeling like a fraud or a con artist can be a hazard of the writing profession; there’s a fine line, Balzac wrote, between the artist and the criminal. That’s certainly true of Frankie Abandonato — a New York grifter who makes the critical error of pulling a lottery scam on a mobster. Abandonato, the hero of James Magnuson’s novel “Famous Writers I Have Known,” slips town for Texas, holing up at a creative writing institute where he’s mistaken for a J. D. Salingeresque recluse named V. S. Mohle. (The real Mohle was expected on campus to teach a seminar while either reconciling or settling an old score — it’s complicated — with the institute’s fabulously successful founder, Rex Schoeninger, whose sprawling social novels are reminiscent of James Michener’s; their feud culminated years ago in a brawl on “The Dick Cavett Show,” after which Mohle dropped out of society and never published again.)"

In Sickness and in Health,2014-01-17,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Nancy Horan’s second historical novel reimagines another tempestuous love story.,"Nancy Horan’s first novel, “Loving Frank,” explored the tangled personal life of Frank Lloyd Wright. Now, in her second, she takes a deep, long look at the intimate history of yet another creative man. This time, the action is viewed from two perspectives — those of Robert Louis Stevenson and (even more so) of his American wife, Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, who hopes to be a painter or a writer herself. “Under the Wide and Starry Sky” is at once a classic artistic bildungsroman and a retort to the genre, a novel that shows how love and marriage can simultaneously offer inspiration and encumbrance, especially when the more successful partner believes that, as far as artists go, “a family could tolerate only one.” The Stevensons’ story is full of morbidity and sacrifice, chronicling losses and gains — and, of course, the writing of classics like “Treasure Island,” “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” and “Kidnapped,” none of which, Horan suggests, would have been possible without Fanny Stevenson’s careful nurturing of her husband."

Egypt: Clashes Erupt During Protests,2014-01-18,article,Brief,,"['Demonstrations, Protests, and Riots', 'Constitutions', 'Referendums']",Egypt’s security forces killed at least two protesters and arrested more than a hundred on Friday during demonstrations around the country.," Egypt’s security forces killed at least two protesters and arrested more than a hundred on Friday during demonstrations around the country against the military government, the state news media reported. In recent days millions voted to approve a new constitution validating the military takeover last summer. Friday’s clashes are the first evidence that the new charter is unlikely to resolve the complaints of the protest movement, the terrorist threat from a budding insurgency or Egypt’s deep divisions. At least one protester was killed in Fayoum, south of Cairo, and another on the outskirts of Cairo. Separately, a report from Democracy International, an election-monitoring group that sent 80 observers to track the constitutional referendum, said it had “serious concerns” about the political environment of the voting, with “arrests and detention of dissenting voices” and “no real opportunity for those opposed to the government’s road map of the proposed constitution to dissent.” "

The Department of Environmental Affairs blamed poachers who cross the border from Mozambique to South Africa, then sell the horns to places like Vietnam and China, where they are symbols of wealth and are used in potions. The number of rhinos illegally killed in South Africa has been climbing since at least 2010, when 333 deaths were reported. Susie Ellis, of the global nonprofit group International Rhino Foundation, said the latest figure was almost certainly an undercount. “Those are only the deaths that we know about,” she said.

Turkey: Contentious Medical Bill Signed,2014-01-18,article,Brief,,"['First Aid', 'Human Rights and Human Rights Violations', 'Emergency Medical Treatment']",President Abdullah Gul signed a measure into law on Friday that makes it a crime to administer emergency first aid without government authorization.," Over the objections of human rights and medical groups, President Abdullah Gul signed a measure into law on Friday that makes it a crime to administer emergency first aid without government authorization. Critics contend that the law could be used by the police and prosecutors to intimidate and punish doctors and other medical workers for treating protesters wounded in demonstrations against the government, like those in Turkey last year. “Passing a bill that criminalizes emergency care and punishes those who care for injured protesters is part of the Turkish government’s relentless effort to silence any opposing voices,” said Dr. Vincent Iacopino, senior medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights, one of the groups that had campaigned against the legislation. If convicted, violators could be imprisoned for up to three years and face fines of nearly $1 million. "

The lawmaker, Koichi Hagiuda of Mr. Abe’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, said it was unfair for the United States to expect Japanese leaders to refrain from visiting the Yasukuni shrine, which honors the nation’s war dead, when American politicians can freely honor their fallen soldiers. “If Japan says, ‘It’s unfavorable to pay a visit to Arlington National Cemetery,’ do they refrain from going there?” Mr. Hagiuda, a special adviser to Mr. Abe, was quoted as saying by the Kyodo News Agency. “I assume the United States will say, ‘It’s none of a foreign country’s business.’ ” Mr. Hagiuda was responding to an American government statement expressing disappointment with Mr. Abe’s visit to the controversial Shinto shrine on Dec. 26. Washington feared such a visit could anger other Asian nations, where Yasukuni is viewed as a symbol of Japan’s refusal to come to terms with its brutal 20th-century militarism because it honors all war dead, including convicted war criminals. The shrine also houses a museum that views World War II as a noble struggle by Japan to liberate Asia from white imperialism. "

What’s on Saturday,2014-01-18,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Showtime) SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012) Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper, above), who has returned to the home of his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) after eight months in a mental institution, following a violent crime, tries to tackle the world — and reclaim his estranged wife, Nikki, who took out a restraining order against him — through a physical and psychological regimen he created while locked away. Then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a heartbreaker who persuades Pat that she can circumvent the law by passing a letter from him to Nikki — if only he’ll enter a dance contest with her. Soon, she is leading, and he is following. “For all its high-flying zaniness, the movie has the sting of life, and its humor feels dredged up from the same dark, boggy place from which Samuel Beckett extracted his yuks,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this best picture Oscar nominee directed by David O. Russell, which also earned nominations for Mr. Cooper, Ms. Weaver and Mr. De Niro, and a win for Ms. Lawrence. “ ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ is crammed with people talking and shouting and weeping and also yielding to what are sometimes called boundary issues but which here turn out to be the mad, loving scrambling of people finding and saving one another,” Ms. Dargis added. “These are characters who get in one another’s faces and occasionally punch a loved one right in the kisser.

What’s On Today?,2014-01-19,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights,"1:30 P.M. (Showtime2) AMÉLIE (2001) Audrey Tautou, above, in her breakthrough role, plays a French sprite working as a waitress who lays out elaborate practical jokes as payback for those who offend her friends. When she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), Amélie finds herself incapable of revealing her feelings and instead turns Paris, recreated through sets and computer-generated imagery, into a kind of treasure hunt as she leaves clues about her identity, and he trails after her. Writing in The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell called this comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whose original title was “Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain,” “a sugar-rush of a movie.” It has, he said, “a hypnotic sense of romance; it’s a fable filled with longing, with a heroine who constantly flirts with failure.” The film’s “fastidious complex of flesh and fantasy is a dazzling achievement,” he added. There is no denying, he said “that ‘Amélie’ is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous.”"

Hope Davis plays his flaky, depressed mother; Robert Downey Jr. is the high school’s alcoholic principal, whose relationship with Charlie turns into warfare, once he learns that Charlie is dating his rebellious daughter (Kat Dennings). “In the movie’s funniest scene, Charlie and his business partner, Murphy, the school bully who beat him up and dunked his head in the toilet when he first arrived, dispense Ritalin to the students and turn a dance into a frenzied free-for-all with bare-breasted girls running down the halls,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The movie, directed by Jon Poll from a screenplay by Gustin Nash, is never more amusingly subversive than in this scene, which suggests the hypocrisy of American attitudes toward drugs without putting it in words.” Still, he said, “as the movie dashes from one base to the next, it never coalesces into the character-driven, serious comedy with heart that you want it be.”"

D. Salinger as run his memory and legacy through a spin cycle of hype.

When the word “Spanish” materialized, I tapped the side of the glasses to select it, a process you need do only once to lock in a language for an entire trip. Seconds later, the street sign was in English: “Attention, area of construction. No trespassing.”"
Capturing the New York of the 1960s and ’70s,2014-01-23,article,News,,['Photography'],"Fred W. McDarrah, who for decades was The Village Voice’s only staff photographer, had access to his subjects that photographers could only dream of today.","If we had known that the scrawny guy onstage at that Greenwich Village folk club might someday amount to something, we’d have all been there, camera in hand, to document the event. But we didn’t, so we weren’t. Fred W. McDarrah, on the other hand, made it a point to be there: when Bob Dylan first performed in New York; when Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg held court at house parties in Greenwich Village, or Andy Warhol at his studio, the Factory; when the hippies or the gay liberation movement found their voices; when downtown New York was the incubator for the cultural movements that shook the world. Mr. McDarrah, who died in 2007, was the first photo editor and for decades the only staff photographer of The Village Voice. He had a front-row seat for multiple revolutions, with access that photographers today cannot imagine. “You could be standing three feet from Jimi Hendrix at a cocktail party and start shooting,” said Mr. McDarrah’s son Patrick, 47. “You could never just do that now with Jay Z.” Back then, said Mr. McDarrah’s other son, Timothy, 51, “We’d answer the phone and it would be, ‘Hi, it’s Andy, is Freddie there?’ ”"
Should Pope Francis Rethink Abortion?,2014-01-24,article,News,,"['ABORTION', 'Ethics (Personal)']",Doctrinal revision needn’t contradict his commitment to the “value of the human person.”,"Pope Francis has raised expectations of a turn away from the dogmatic intransigence that has long cast a pall over the religious life of many Roman Catholics. His question “Who am I to judge?” suggested a new attitude toward homosexuality, and he is apparently willing to consider allowing the use of contraceptives to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. But his position on what has come to be the hierarchy’s signature issue — abortion — seems unyielding. “Reason alone is sufficient to recognize the inviolable value of each single human life,” he declared in his recent apostolic exhortation, “Evangelii Gaudium,” adding: “Precisely because this involves the internal consistency of our message about the value of the human person, the church cannot be expected to change her position on this question.”I want to explore the possibility, however, that the pope might be open to significant revision of the absolute ban on abortion by asking what happens if we take seriously his claim that “reason alone is sufficient” to adjudicate this issue. What actually follows regarding abortion once we accept the “inviolable value of each single human life”? This appeal to rational reflection has been a central feature of the tradition of Catholic moral teaching. I put forward the following reflections in the spirit of this tradition.There is considerable rational basis for moral concern about abortions. In many (probably most) cases, it would be immoral to abort a pregnancy. (Note, however, that this by no means implies that most abortions actually performed are immoral.) Late-term fetuses, for example, are no different biologically or psychologically from babies born prematurely at the same stage of development. It’s hard to see how killing a premature baby is immoral but killing an identical late-term fetus isn’t. At a minimum, aborting a healthy late-term fetus would, except when the mother’s life is at risk, be immoral — which is no doubt why it is seldom, if ever, done."

Sundance Diary | The Sun Sets Early on Park City,2014-01-24,article,News,,"['Movies', 'Sundance Film Festival (Park City, Utah)']",A look back at the best — and more bizarre — happenings and offerings during this year’s film extravaganza.,"The 2014 Sundance Film Festival may not be over yet, but with most of its high-profile premieres wrapped up and a large portion of the celebrity contingent already back in their L.A. and New York enclaves, Park City, Utah, certainly has the feel of a circus ready to leave town. The festival, which officially concludes on Sunday, had a strong lineup this year and featured a total of 118 feature-length films from 37 different countries and 54 first-time filmmakers. And while film sales have been relatively quiet — the reported $3 million that Sony Pictures Classics paid for the opening-night film, “Whiplash,” pales in comparison to the $9.75 million that Fox Searchlight shelled out for “The Way, Way Back” last year — the creative output has been promising."

Sitting at a table with drinks and a couple of friends was Joe Kennedy, 24, who moved to New York five months ago from a college town in Missouri. A friend recommended that he check out the place (90 Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn; there was some debate at the table whether this was East Williamsburg or Bushwick).

The Year in Adaptation,2014-01-24,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],A look back at the books that made it to the big screen.,"Cinematic book adaptations dominated 2012, with “Life of Pi,” “Silver Linings Playbook” and “Anna Karenina” springing from novels, and “Lincoln” and “Argo” drawing their stories from the nonfiction shelves. There was plenty of bookish inspiration in 2013, but the results elicited less enthusiasm. Martin Scorsese’s Oscar contender, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” was adapted from a memoir by Jordan Belfort.

There Must Be Some Misunderstanding,2014-01-24,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Navigating the terrors of adulthood, the characters in Ben Marcus’s story collection resort to extreme survival strategies.","Ben Marcus achieved the startling visions of his first story collection, “The Age of Wire and String,” and the novels “Notable American Women” and “The Flame Alphabet” largely by placing the reader in strange and unfamiliar worlds that turned out to be our world after all. The stories of his new collection, “Leaving the Sea,” still contain peculiar linguistic and perceptual tics, but he has added to his arsenal narratives that are less relentlessly unfamiliar, less rigorously dis-enchanted, populated by characters full of longing and visible regret, though for what is not always clear. For fans of the old style, like me, there are still plenty of messed-up points of view, and we can be reassured that while most of the work in this collection begins on familiar ground, it happily disintegrates into confusion and dread. In the end Marcus presents a deeper range of identification for the reader, more emotional complexity, but still plenty of the chair-gripping alienation that marked his previous books."
Writer of a Certain Age,2014-01-24,article,News,,"['Writing and Writers', 'Books and Literature', 'Women and Girls']",The author remembers when looks started to matter in publishing.,"When I started out as a television dramatist in the ’60s, it was a truism that the more fanciable the female lead, the higher the ratings. Casting was a simple matter of sitting by the director while he flipped through acting photo directories and selected his preference. Theater was no different. When I took to writing plays in the ’70s, it was understood that if two mature women were talking onstage, audience members would cough and shift in their seats, but if two men of any age were talking, the audience would pay some attention. And if a man of any age and a young woman were alone onstage, you could hear a pin drop. "

The Vanishing,2014-01-24,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Valerie Martin’s novel explores the enduring enigma of a 19th-century ship found floating in the Atlantic without captain or crew.,"On Dec. 4, 1872, the brigantine Mary ­Celeste was discovered abandoned, adrift in the North Atlantic near the Azores. The ship was empty and its crew missing, although its cargo and provisions were intact, as were the crew’s possessions. The weather was calm and the ship was seaworthy, but no trace of the crew — or of the captain’s wife and 2-year-old child — was ever found. Newspapers around the world carried the story, and it inspired one of Arthur Conan Doyle’s first published pieces of fiction, “J. Habakuk Jephson’s Statement,” printed anonymously in the British journal Cornhill. From then until the present, dozens of other investigations, novels, historical accounts, television documentaries and movies have been devoted to what has become the prototypical ghost ship.

Commitment,2014-01-24,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Roddy Doyle’s Jimmy Rabbitte reappears, dealing with cancer, mortality and love.","Roddy Doyle’s new novel, “The Guts,” begins with a conversation about Facebook. Jimmy Rabbitte, the hero of Doyle’s 1987 novel, “The Commitments,” and a key figure in that book’s two successors, “The Snapper” and “The Van,” sits in a pub with his father, Jimmy Sr. The two men are arguing (or simply talking; it can be difficult to tell in Doyle’s starkly profane dialect), and the son explains social networking thus to his dad: “It’s like a club but yeh have your own room, for the people yeh want to meet. Except there’s no room an’ yeh meet no one. Unless yeh want to.” For a moment, perhaps, we think we know what to expect: a rambunctious comedy about aging musicians, working-class life, rock ’n’ roll, something fundamentally upbeat, because that’s what Doyle does. Even his darker books — “The Woman Who Walked Into Doors,” say, that raw tale of a woman’s abuse at the hands of her alcoholic husband — have a way of seeming spry, sunny underneath their patina of hardscrabble realism. So we’re ready for the comedy of crusty ­middle-aged Jimmy and his father navigating the dubious world of text messaging and mobile phones (after all, we haven’t seen them fleshed out in a novel since the 1990 of “The Van”). But the younger Jimmy has something else on his mind."

The future Richard III pairs those elements in the first line of Shakespeare’s play, and they are also paired, with piercing chill, in James Scott’s debut novel, “The Kept.” It is 1897. Elspeth Howell is making her way to an isolated cabin in upstate New York. Elspeth is pursued by cruel weather and her past as “a sinner,” a woman besieged by “anger, covetousness, thievery.” Unlike “false and treacherous” Richard, she believes she has conquered her worst impulses. She bears gifts for her five children and her husband, Jorah. She longs for the comforts of home. What she discovers, instead, is the worst kind of retribution — a slaughter of innocents triggered by her own compulsive history."

The book doesn’t arrive without controversy: Ailes, the founder and president of Fox News Channel, refused to cooperate with Sherman and went so far as to grant exclusive access to a rival journalist, the Rush Limbaugh biographer Zev Chafets, in evident hopes of pre-empting Sherman with a friendlier account. (Chafets’s book, “Roger Ailes: Off Camera,” was published in March 2013 and spent a week on the e-book nonfiction list.) On NPR’s “Fresh Air” last month, Sherman described his efforts to interview Ailes in terms that called to mind Michael Moore’s early documentary “Roger and Me,” about the General Motors chief executive Roger Smith. “I reached out to Roger Ailes more than a dozen times in the two and a half years I was doing the researching and writing, both in person and in writing,” he said. “I traveled to different states to see him at public events to tell him I was eager to sit down and discuss every fact in the book. Ultimately, it was his decision not to participate.” Ailes’s opposition, he continued, had provided “a crash course in what it must be like to be involved in a political campaign. . . . I’m not the story. Roger Ailes is the story. But he has elevated me to a place where it’s this kind of me-­versus-him dynamic.”"

The British ambassador to the United Nations, Mark Lyall Grant, told reporters the resolution was intended to send a message to terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda that rely on ransom payments as a major source of financing. “We need to be honest about the impact ransoms have in sustaining terrorist activity,” the ambassador said. Governments rarely confirm, let alone publicly discuss, the details of ransom payments to kidnappers. The resolution applies only to payments to terrorist organizations, not other types of kidnappers."

How did you choose this aspect of Hillary Clinton’s political future for lengthier treatment?When I moved onto this beat, friends and colleagues said, “You’re going to cover one person for the next four years?!” But with Hillary Clinton, it’s never just one person (or even three people, with President Clinton and Chelsea). I found out that there is a huge cast of characters the Clintons have collected over the years. Their perspective and place in this world is an essential part of who Hillary is and what her future might look like. A person who went to Georgetown with Bill Clinton told me lots of his classmates were thinking about running for president, but only Clinton was building his cabinet. They’re unique in American politics in that they’ve collected so many people over the years — from Arkansas to the White House and to whatever she does in the future. I wanted to explore that dynamic, and the benefits of having such an enormous brain trust, but also the downside to having so many voices who all have a stake in 2016."

One deportee, now an adult, recalls that he was told, at 10, that he was being sent to a sunny paradise where he could pick oranges off trees. Instead, many of the youngsters found themselves forced into hard labor and enduring physical cruelty and sexual abuse at places like the Bindoon Boys Town, presided over by the Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order. The victims were informed that their parents were dead, while their parents — mainly unwed mothers deemed unfit — were told that their children had been placed for adoption in better homes. “This film presents a chilling portrait of bureaucratic stonewalling and denial as Margaret presents her evidence to politicians who meet her accusations with indifference and skepticism, express only a vague regret and assume no responsibility,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, directed by Jim Loach from Ms. Humphreys’s 1994 book, “Empty Cradles.”"

The Post-Hope Politics of ‘House of Cards’,2014-01-31,article,News,,"['Television', 'Writing and Writers', 'Web-Original Programming']",Every generation gets the Washington TV show it deserves — and Beau Willimon’s Washington is only getting darker.,"At 6:45 a.m. on a September day in Baltimore, when the heat was already loitering in the 80s and would eventually flirt with 100 degrees, Beau Willimon, the show runner for “House of Cards,” finished his first — or maybe second, or actually probably his third — cigarette of the day and stalked onto the show’s outdoor set. Every set of a TV show is a little reminiscent of a ragged Civil War camp, with its provisional tents and huddled groups of conferring higher-ups and wandering assistants tending to disparate needs. But on the “House of Cards” set — temporarily erected in a small park adjacent to a block of Baltimore townhouses — this feeling was heightened by the presence of Willimon, with his facial hair that might be best described as “sort-of mutton chops”; his beeline intensity; and, of course, that name: Beau Willimon, which seems perfectly suited to a brass plaque in the South somewhere, commemorating a particularly brave or foolhardy general. His hair was an unkempt pompadour, and he wore an untucked work shirt, unlaced work boots and jeans with a back pocket so tattered that it barely cradled his wallet, a situation that at least three people, including me, felt moved to warn him about it, though he waved each of us off in turn.

I’d won a Mademoiselle contest and would be one of 20 young women working at the magazine for a month in the summer. It was 1953, and I was excited but also frightened and daunted; I hadn’t been on an airliner before, and no one I knew had been to New York except my Sioux Falls uncle, Bill, a buyer for a department store. In case of difficulties, I was to call my Uncle Bill’s New York friend, Mr. Herbert Solomon."

The Empire State Building in Ice,2014-01-31,article,News,,"['Ice', 'Photography']",The Harbin Ice and Snow World in northeast China.,"Every winter, hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the Harbin Ice and Snow World in northeast China, near the Songhua River, to see its vast collection of elaborately carved ice structures, many of them illuminated with colorful LEDs. The arduous task of quickly collecting all that ice for an exhibition that opens in early January begins in mid-December, and the ice city has been getting bigger every year. This time around, 180,000 cubic meters of ice were used. Some of the finished sculptures this year, which remain in place until March, are a homage to structures around the world, from the Colosseum to the Empire State Building. Zengyu Wang, the executive manager of the event, says the local government in Harbin dreamed up the festival as a lure to promote winter tourism. When visitors see the ice for the first time, he says, they have one reaction: “Very shocked.” Julie Bosman"

As children went from helping on the farm to being the focus of relentless cosseting, they shifted “from being our employees to our bosses,” Jennifer Senior observes in her trenchant and engrossing first book, “All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood.” Senior, a contributing editor at New York magazine, examines what it means to be a parent, through interviews with a handful of families who are neither typical nor extraordinary. These are snapshots, not longitudinal documentaries, but in the way of good snapshots, they tell more than one might notice at first glance, and they allow for cautious universalizing. She supplements these vignettes with extremely impressive research, weaving in insights from philosophy, psychology and an occasionally overwhelming mélange of social science reports."

Alfred Dreyfus. Dreyfus was a 35-year-old artillery officer, a high-ranking graduate of the elite École Polytechnique and the École de Guerre (the French Army’s war college), and was chosen on the basis of his grades and overall performance to train with the army’s general staff. Robert Harris, in his fine novel “An Officer and a Spy,” lucidly retells the famous, bizarrely complicated and chilling story. His narrator is Lt. Col. Georges Picquart, who was promoted to that grade six months after Dreyfus’s arrest and put in charge of the general staff’s statistical section (the coy sobriquet of a counter­intelligence unit), and went on to become one of Dreyfus’s improbable and indispensable saviors."

Breaking In,2014-01-31,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The story of a 1971 raid on an F.B.I. office and what it revealed about bureau practices.,"On a March evening in 1971, eight antiwar protesters burglarized an F.B.I. office in Media, Pa., just outside Philadelphia, with astonishing ease. A few weeks of elementary surveillance had shown them the vulnerability of the target: There were no cameras to elude, no alarms to disconnect. Because the building contained residential apartments, the group chose the night of the first Joe Frazier-­Muhammad Ali heavyweight championship fight, an ideal distraction. It turned out that the Pennsylvania office, like so many others across the country, had almost no physical protection. Security was largely symbolic, resting on the bureau’s carefully buffed reputation for efficiency in tracking down America’s “most wanted” criminals, from bank robbers to atomic spies. Put simply, no one messed with J. Edgar Hoover’s F.B.I. "

The Marriage Plod,2014-01-31,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Jude Cook’s novel, a failed poet relives his calamitous relationship with his wife.","How disgusting the British find themselves! Let me rephrase that. If you were to go by the output of a certain strand of young, male British fiction writer, you could easily be forgiven for thinking the main activity of British life is being disgusted by the physical form of oneself and one’s fellows. Ian McEwan began a short story noting the peculiar smell asparagus lends the urine (“it suggests sexual activity of some kind between exotic creatures”). Martin Amis spent large parts of his early career detailing his characters’ bleeding gums and cracked molars. Will Self’s books come so awash in bodily fluids that if you were to throw them against a wall they’d most likely stick. Male self-disgust, rooted in the moist tumult of adolescence, and extended into one’s 20s and 30s under cover of literary careers aping the clinical imperturbability of Nabokov and Joyce, has almost bequeathed us its own genre. We might call it, in the manner of those outraged letters to British broadsheets, “Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells.” "

Lonely Hunter,2014-01-31,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A young woman disappears and evidence points to a troubled war veteran in Joyce Carol Oates’s novel.,"At the Brooklyn Museum, an exhibit called “War/Photography: Images of Armed Conflict and Its Aftermath,” which went up in November, featured a photograph by Nina Berman of a young Marine sergeant, Ty Ziegel, who was horrifically injured and disfigured by a suicide bomb in Iraq in 2004. Returning home, he underwent scores of surgeries and in 2006 married his sweetheart in Illinois. The marriage didn’t last, and Ziegel died in December 2012. But nobody who saw the “Marine Wedding” series will be able to forget him — or the damage wrought by war on his body, his life and his family.

Readers of even passing acquaintance with the Vietnam War will most likely know of Jeremiah Denton’s televised 1966 interview — one of the first glimpses of the life of United States military pilots who had been shot down and captured. American viewers watched in horror and puzzlement as Denton, an emaciated, hunched figure dressed in gray prison garb, defiantly telegraphed the word t-o-r-t-u-r-e by blinking out the letters in Morse code. His brave act was followed by yet more torture, and some time later Vietnamese authorities bundled him along with 10 other men out of the infamous Hanoi Hilton, as Hoa Lo prison in the North Vietnamese capital was known (and where John McCain, probably the most famous P.O.W. of the war, would be held). The destination of the Eleven was an even filthier hellhole a few miles away, which they nicknamed Alcatraz."

Lively has explored these themes before, in her many novels and in a handful of previous memoirs. This time, though, she says she wants to address them more abstractly: “I find myself thinking less about what has happened to me but interested in this lifetime context, in the times of my life.” She’s not trying to tell us a story."

It’s probably more accurate to say that this ungainly but thoroughly charming book is the author’s own eccentric notion of a murder mystery, and that it’s a lot of fun to read. Also, it features a teenage sleuth — “idiosyncratic of appearance, timorous of character, but magnificent of mind,” according to her besotted grandfather — who is pretty much irresistible."
