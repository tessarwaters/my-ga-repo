In it, he is seen emerging shirtless from a small, thatched hut, carrying a rudimentary stone hatchet. Then he walks, silently and purposefully, to a copse of narrow trees. He chops one down and carries it back to the clearing. He repeats this action until he has assembled a pile of timber. We watch as he demolishes his old, thatched workshop and builds a new one, twice the size. The man does not explain what he is doing as he frames the structure or as he thatches the roof with palm fronds and vines; in fact, he doesn’t talk at all. If you turn on the closed captioning, you can see descriptions of his actions, but only very general ones: “lashing rafters,” “putting rafters in place,” etc. There is no music. There’s no extradiegetic sound at all — just the forest’s chirping melodies and the rustling and chopping and hammering of insects, birds, wind in leaves, stone on wood. After completing the shelter, the man builds a pit and starts a fire by rubbing sticks together, to ward off mosquitoes."

Maybe this is because they don’t know how billionaires affect their lives or what political power they wield; maybe it’s just because a billion is such an unfathomably large number. A decade or so ago, three political scientists at Northwestern University, Benjamin Page, Jason Seawright and Matthew Lacombe, set out to determine the impact that superrich Americans have on congressional and presidential policies. They weren’t starting from scratch; previous work done by another political scientist, Martin Gilens, used years of surveys of thousands of poor, middle-income and affluent Americans to show that policymakers responded almost exclusively to the preferences of that last group. Following this earlier research, Page told me recently, “I wanted to find out how much influence the truly wealthy have and what they want from government.” Page and his colleagues wanted to do a quantitative analysis of political inequality. First, however, they had to figure out where to get the data."

In this poem, “Cataracts,” she writes about the cloudy vision many of us will experience as we age. The poem starts with a surprising image of the deteriorating eyes as turtles, but the turtle also serves as a metaphor for the physical retreat of the whole body as it crawls toward the “final haze” of death. We move gradually to something larger, ending with a declarative: “There is no surgery for this.” But the poem reminds us of the “sliver of disheveled beauty” and the “66 years of scenery” the eyes have captured.

It reminds me of a dictionary entry for “detritus” that I copied down in a notebook: “the pieces that are left when something breaks, falls apart, is destroyed, etc.” That seemed so artfully vague to me, so uncharacteristically casual for a dictionary. It has a quality of distraction, of trailing off, of suggesting you already know what detritus means.
