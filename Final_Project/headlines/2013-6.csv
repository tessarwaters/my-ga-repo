O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Eastwood “has the good sense to realize that, much as we may adore him, we’d sometimes rather spend time with Ms. Adams, who somehow grows tougher, funnier, scarier and more charming with every role.” The film, Mr. Scott added, “may be an exhibition game, with nothing much at stake, but Ms. Adams brings the heat.

IHT Quick Read: June 1,2013-06-01,article,News,,[],German population fears; identifying factory fire’s victims; unemployment rises in Euro zone; and deflation may be ending in Japan.,"NEWS It’s as if Leipzig, Hanover and Dresden had disappeared in the blink of an eye, statistically speaking. Germany, which has been deeply concerned about its rapidly dwindling population, released the results of its first census in nearly a quarter of a century on Friday and found 1.5 million fewer inhabitants than previously assumed. Chancellor Angela Merkel was already worried about the shrinking numbers of taxpayers and able-bodied workers. How future smaller generations will repay German debts, much less the mounting liabilities and guarantees meant to contain the euro-zone debt crisis, is a central question here. Germany had not conducted a single census count since reunification, not even an effort to tally those in the former East Germany after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The disappearance of 1.5 million people, equal to almost 1.9 percent of the population, only exacerbates the longer-term downward trend. Nick Kulish and Chris Cottrell report from Berlin."

(AMC) THE KILLING With the killer of Rosie Larsen finally revealed at the end of the second season, this series — which was canceled and then revived — returns with a new case, which the network says will be solved in a single year. And while Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos, above) is no longer working as a Seattle detective, she is drawn back into that life by her former partner Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman). During a search for a runaway girl, he discovers a string of gruesome murders seemingly connected to an investigation she headed several years earlier. Peter Sarsgaard joins the cast as Tom Seward, the psychopath who was convicted in those murders and is just weeks away from execution. Still, even with new colleagues, victims and suspects, “Season 3 looks an awful lot like the first two: brooding clouds; menacing, slate-colored skies; and leaden seas are still featured players,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “The creators take a fresh start but cling to the sepulchral atmospherics that too often take the place of narrative.

Instead, he inks his own experiences, which seem informed by the twin responses shared by many New York transplants: anxiety and wonder. In one illustration, a lone man looks out from his darkened apartment and wonders how many people are having sex at that moment. Another panel tells the story of a long-ago night when Mr. Kuper and a friend scaled the suspension cables of the Brooklyn Bridge. The artistic styles change from page to page, mirroring the frenetic, unpredictable nature of the city. As Mr. Kuper said, “The thing I like about New York is the quality of feeling like you’re traveling at all times.” "

Now, 60 years later, there is an answer to the question everyone — or at least one or two people — has been asking ever since: where can I get those chic reindeer boots? The answer is Bally, the Swiss company that in the ’40s began custom-making boots for serious mountaineers, among them the pair that Tenzing wore for his storied ascent. In honor of the anniversary of that climb — and the fact that the old-fashioned mountaineer has become a style model in men’s fashion — Bally is issuing a new version of the boots. The sole is lighter in weight and they lace more easily. But like the originals, they are available only by order, and they are still made of reindeer fur. They may never help you get to the top of a mountain, but, at $2,495, they will definitely get you to the tiptop of your credit card limit. Bally, 628 Madison Avenue; (212) 751-9082."

The grill master might scoff, but I have increasingly come to rely on my oven, sealing the deal with a slow bake after a quick sizzle atop the stove. That’s how I made these pork chops, with their lusty Neapolitan topping to accompany a sturdy aglianico. The slow cooking gently brings the meat to tenderness, guarding its juices. It also grants the cook nearly an hour to assemble the rest of the dinner, and what does the grill master know about that? (You might consider moving the meat away from the fire and covering the grill, but the temperature will not be as consistent and will require monitoring.) Penne or other modest macaroni dressed with just olive oil and chile flakes is excellent alongside, to share the sauce with the meat. "

The Other Sister,2013-06-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The narrator of Karen Joy Fowler’s latest novel spent part of her childhood in a long household experiment with an adopted chimpanzee for a twin sister.,"To experience this novel exactly as the author intended, a reader should avoid the flap copy and everything else written about it.

No reviewer could blow the surprise of a convict benefactor or Miss Havisham’s cobwebby cake when these were yet unwritten. But in modern times, literary fiction presents a conundrum: The more craftily constructed its suspense, the more it tempts its advocates — in the interest of airtime — to reach into a serious tale and pull out something resembling a tabloid headline. Such as: “Girl and Chimp Twinned at Birth in Psychological Experiment.” That’s the big reveal in Karen Joy Fowler’s “We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves,” a novel so readably juicy and surreptitiously smart, it deserves all the attention it can get."

What’s On Friday,2013-06-07,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"1 A.M. (Showtime 2) TAKE THIS WALTZ (2012) Margot, a young wife (Michelle Williams, above) in Toronto, finds herself attracted to a stranger (Luke Kirby) on a trip to Nova Scotia and is dismayed to discover, after sitting together on the flight home and sharing a cab from the airport, that he lives across the street from the charming row house she shares with her husband (Seth Rogen). She doesn’t want to give up her infatuation with her handsome neighbor. But she also does not want to destroy her marriage. He merely lets her know that he is interested and available should she change her mind. That ambivalence is central to what A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called “Sarah Polley’s honest, sure-footed, emotionally generous second feature,” which he chose as a critics’ pick. “Ms. Williams, one of the bravest and smartest actresses working in movies today, portrays a young woman who is indecisive and confused, but never passive,” he said. “Margot’s uncertainty, as she and Ms. Polley understand it, is a kind of passion in its own right. The current of her desire runs strongly in two directions: toward the man she knows and loves, and toward the stranger she wants in ways beyond her immediate understanding.” He added: “There is a moment about 90 minutes in that I was sure was the end, and I still think that stopping there would have made ‘Take This Waltz’ perfect. But I’m also willing to grant that perfection may not have been Ms. Polley’s chief concern, especially since the great theme of this wonderful movie — a source of delight as well as distress — is that imperfection is all anyone ever learns from love.”"

For her, it seems no great feat to balance high-literary intentions with broad social critique. “Americanah” examines blackness in America, Nigeria and Britain, but it’s also a steady-handed dissection of the universal human experience — a platitude made fresh by the accuracy of Adichie’s observations."

Who He Really Was,2013-06-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Alysia Abbott searches for the truth about her father’s life.,"When Alysia Abbott was a child, she constructed a fairy tale of sorts from the shards of her family’s short life together. Barbara Binder, beautiful Smith College graduate and aspiring psychologist, and Steve Abbott, conscientious objector and budding writer, had been an ideal match. Drawn together by radical politics while master’s candidates at Emory University, they were married in Atlanta in 1969. Late the next year, Alysia-Rebeccah was born. “We lived happily,” she writes in her memoir, “Fairyland,” hewing to her childhood fantasy, “until, one night late in the summer of 1973, my mother was out driving when her car was rear-ended. She flew into the street, was hit by a car and was killed instantly.”"
Who She Really Was,2013-06-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Emma Brockes searches for the truth about her mother’s life.,"Emma Brockes, a reporter for The Guardian, was the only child of a middle-class couple in a small town in England. Her mother, Paula, was born poor in South Africa, lost her mother to tuberculosis, helped care for her seven half siblings and emigrated alone at 28 to England, where she married and had Emma. The differences in their lives notwithstanding, Brockes writes in her new book, “it didn’t occur to me until an absurdly late stage that we might, in fact, be separate people.” Paula deflected questions about her previous life, which enabled Brockes to maintain that illusion. “If it struck me as odd that we never saw or heard from” her mother’s brothers and sisters, Brockes writes, “I didn’t dwell on it. Like most children, the life my parents led before I was born was a rumor I didn’t believe in.”"

A New York Perfumer Finds an Unlikely Source of Inspiration,2013-06-11,article,News,,['Perfumes and Fragrances'],The new unisex fragrance by Aedes de Venustas is based on the look — not the scent — of a rare Israeli wildflower.,"This Saturday, a little over a year after introducing its namesake signature fragrance — a combination of rhubarb and Madagascar vetiver — the Greenwich Village boutique-turned-perfumer Aedes de Venustas will release its much-anticipated follow-up. Teaming up this time with the German perfumer Ralf Schwieger, whose clients include the likes of Frédéric Malle and Hermès, the brand’s co-owners Karl Bradl and Robert Gerstner attempted to capture the essence of a rare flower to create the unisex aroma Iris Nazarena. “The inspiration was an iris that grows only in the mountains of Nazareth,” said Bradl, who discovered the species through art on a postcard. “It is a protected wildflower, so we could not harvest or remove the flower.” What’s more, iris flowers don’t actually have a scent — typically, only their roots do — so the team had to get creative. The fragrance they created, according to Bradl, is inspired by the “color, texture and pattern of the blossom.” The result is decidedly not floral. Instead, the eau de parfum has a powdery quality, with musky hints of clove and star anise, evoking burning incense — a signature note in the olfactory repertory of Aedes de Venustas, whose house line includes a scented room spray and candles. The effect is like a visit to an officers’ club from a bygone era, all smoky wood, aged leather and classic men’s cologne."

What’s on Tuesday,2013-06-11,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"1 P.M. (Sundance) L’AMOUR FOU (2011) The French couturier Yves Saint Laurent, below, may have been surrounded by intense beauty, both in the atelier and at home, yet he was said to be joyful only twice a year: on the days a new collection was shown, usually to boisterous acclaim. But within 24 hours, the euphoria had evaporated. Pierre Bergé narrates this documentary about Saint Laurent, his partner in business and in life for a half-century until the designer’s death in 2008. The “crazy love” of the title refers not so much to their relationship but to Saint Laurent’s obsessions with objects, from the artworks — including Picassos, Matisses, Braques and a treasured Brancusi that were sold at a 2009 Christie’s auction — to the perfect houses, which he collected passionately. (All of the rooms in one were named after characters from Proust.) “Much of this stately, rather detached biography,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times of this documentary from Pierre Thoretton, “is pornography for the eye (not the body).” Of Saint Laurent’s depression, he added, “To realize that you may have the world while still feeling as if you have nothing is to experience a closer encounter with the void than most of us are likely to have.”"

What’s on Sunday,2013-06-16,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (49); 10 P.M. (13) INSPECTOR LEWIS, SERIES VI: DOWN AMONG THE FEARFUL A new round of this show, a “Masterpiece Mystery!” stalwart, begins as Inspector Lewis, the long-suffering detective played by Kevin Whately — in what may be his final season as he embarks on a sabbatical — and his sidekick, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway (Laurence Fox, above center, with Mr. Whately, right, and Sanjeev Bhaskar), investigate the murder of a psychic who is an Oxford psychology fellow. Rebecca Front reprises her role as their boss, Chief Superintendent Innocent, and Clare Holman is the winsome pathologist Laura Hobson, whose languorous courtship with Lewis the show promises to resolve. “Knowing that this might be the last hurrah, the writers and directors have given these episodes a valedictory quality that edges up to but doesn’t cross the line of mawkishness; the final, silent fade-out is both moving and appropriately modest,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “And Lewis is always Lewis. In the first episode of ‘Inspector Morse,’ he begged off a trip to the pub with his alcoholic boss because it was his night with the kids. As ‘Inspector Lewis’ comes to a close, he’s ready to give up the whole grind to spend more time with them. You never really believe it when American TV cops say that, but after a quarter-century, we can trust Lewis.” "

What’s on Monday,2013-06-17,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) LOVE, MARILYN (2012) A range of actors and contemporaneous observers recite from recently discovered diaries and letters written by Marilyn Monroe, above, in what David DeWitt, writing in The New York Times, called “a respectful love letter to Monroe,” presented by the director Liz Garbus “as a sexpot, feminist and Tennessee Williams heroine come to life, noble in her respect and need for a sensitive, considerate humanity.” Some, like Glenn Close, Viola Davis and Uma Thurman nail their readings. Others, like Ben Foster, “get a bit cringe-worthy,” Mr. DeWitt said. “But the intelligence and dynamism of Ms. Garbus’s approach could hardly fail to make you appreciate Monroe’s growth as an actor,” he added about this documentary, which includes footage of Monroe performing or giving interviews. “More so, you’ll have sympathy for the hard-working woman whose self-improvement lists included exhortations of things she ‘must’ do and ‘never’ should do.”"

"As Rape Reports Increase in Delhi, a Call for Uncommon Men and Women",2013-06-17,article,News,,"['Police', 'Sex Crimes', 'Women and Girls', ""Women's Rights""]",The tide of rising crimes against women in India can eventually be stemmed by uncommon women and men.,"Last December, a young woman we call “Nirbhaya” was so brutally assaulted and raped by six men on a bus that she died from her injuries two weeks later. She was barely older than my daughter Mira. Grieving, I looked for solace in student memories. I had resisted going to a women’s college at Delhi University, but a few years later at Mount Holyoke, a college for women in Massachusetts, I discovered a world where no one had to remind you to “lean in” because every woman already had her shoulder to the wheel and was moving the needle on everything from microbiology to challenging history with herstory. I was surrounded by women who wrote poetry, discussed politics, dismantled engines, designed buildings, managed newspapers, and danced for the joy of being able to do so. It was a world where women were not less than but equal to – a world, as the playwright Wendy Wasserstein put it, of “Uncommon Women.”The assault happened in New Delhi – the city of my birth and the city where I now live. It is comforting for many to believe that cultures of rape arise in war-torn places like the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now suddenly it was New Delhi that was labeled the “capital of rape.” The latest statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau indicate that a woman is raped in India every 20 minutes and that this horrendous statistic could well be worse because of high levels of underreporting. According to the N.C.R.B., the number of crimes against women reported to the Indian police has increased from 228, 650 in 2011 to 244,270 in 2012. Out of the 24,923 rape cases registered by the police across India in 2012, 706 cases of rape were reported in Delhi, according to the N.C.R.B. In 2011 the number of rape cases reported in Delhi was 572. "

Fischl says the collector was just being matter-of-fact, but really? One of the many reasons to read “Bad Boy” (written with Michael Stone) is how vividly it recreates the precariousness and ambivalences of life in the upper tiers of the international art world. But the collector’s jab also alerts us that it’s a rise-and-fall story we’ve been reading, not just a jolly succession of triumphs. "
Legend Retold,2013-06-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An unfinished poem by J. R. R. Tolkien explores the tale of King Arthur.,"Even in its fragmentary and unfinished form — about 40 pages of text, a bit more than four cantos of what was evidently intended to be a much longer narrative poem — “The Fall of Arthur” is recognizably the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, veteran of the Great War and future author of “The Lord of the Rings.” This is an incomplete but highly compelling retelling of perhaps the most famous and familiar legend in the British tradition, a retelling the author’s son and literary executor, Christopher Tolkien, believes was begun in the early 1930s and abandoned by 1937. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year “The Hobbit” was published, offering readers their first glimpse of a fantasy universe that would shape the imaginative life of the 20th century and beyond."
Just Around the Corner,2013-06-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A looming civil war threatens to engulf the multiethnic Sri Lankan street of Ru Freeman’s novel.,"Before reading this rich, sensory novel, my literary familiarity with Sri Lanka came mostly from Michael Ondaatje’s rollicking memoir, “Running in the Family.” But it was enough of an introduction, with all its extravagant, hilarious dysfunctions, to pique my interest in the island nation. Ru Freeman’s assured second novel is a much quieter yet rewarding portrait of a community of families on a dead-end road in Colombo, the country’s capital. They are a mixed lot on Sal Mal Lane: Sinhalese, Tamils and Burghers, descendants of European colonizers. Down this road live the comfortably middle class and the dirt poor; the sick, the heartbroken and viciously prejudiced; youngsters vivacious with talent, or misshapen by abuse; and a few residents in their middle and later years who are roused by the arrival of the Heraths, a family with four lively children."

Soon, fighting broke out across the city. “It was like when a forest catches fire,” Omar writes; “both the dry and the wet burn.” The family retreated to their basement before the onslaught of rockets and snipers forced them to abandon their home altogether. Piling into their Volga, Omar and his mother, father, three sisters, baby brother, two aunts and seven cousins set out for safer ground. "

Bless the Borrowers,2013-06-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Robert Kuttner champions the cause of indebted students, families and states.","Robert Kuttner’s title refers, first, to the “medieval institution” that was the fate of improvident souls in England who could not repay their debts, including Daniel Defoe. In 1692, Defoe was committed to King’s Bench Prison in London, where he began to agitate for a change in the legal system. Forcing debtors to rot, Defoe not disinterestedly pointed out, was injurious to both parties, since “after a debtor was confined in prison both he and the creditor lost through his prolonged distress.” Society responded, eventually, with bankruptcy laws, but it is very much Kuttner’s point in “Debtors’ Prison” that we — America and Europe in the age of the financial crisis — have yet to absorb the principal lesson of Defoe’s “bitter experience.”"
When Two Paths Meet,2013-06-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Michelle de Kretser’s novel, a Sri Lankan and an Australian seem destined to connect.","Deploying flatulence as a plot device takes nerve. Chaucer got away with it in “The Miller’s Tale,” thanks to the bawdy, rowdy nature of the story. In her ambitious new novel, “Questions of Travel,” the Sri Lankan-Australian novelist Michelle de Kretser gets away with it too, when her main characters, Ravi and Laura, finally have an encounter that seems like a prelude to some greater connection — or at least a reckoning or revelation. But the moment passes with Ravi’s gas. This willful non-event is the culmination of de Kretser’s cool play with conventional reader expectations about how much, and how meaningfully, two disparate lives should matter to each other when they finally converge after pages and pages of parallel-track narratives.

Two books consider the question from different perspectives.,"More than a century ago, the president of Harvard, A. Lawrence Lowell, issued a warning to America’s colleges and universities. “Institutions,” he said, “are rarely murdered. They meet their end by suicide. . . . They die because they have outlived their usefulness, or fail to do the work that the world wants done.” Most of the institutions he had in mind are still around today, but the doomsday talk is back. William J. Bennett, secretary of education under President Reagan, and Jeffrey Selingo, an editor at The Chronicle of Higher Education, believe our system is self-­destructing. Their tones are different — Bennett and his co-author, David Wilezol, write in an expectant mood of good riddance, while Selingo is sympathetically alarmed — but their views are grimly consistent. College costs are up. Learning and graduation rates are down. "

Annus Mirabilis,2013-06-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"From Chinese economic reform to the Iranian revolution, Christian Caryl sees 1979 as a crucial doorway into the present era.","If Christian Caryl had set out to write a book about 1968, showing how the many convulsions and uprisings of that astonishing year were connected, his task would have been an easy one. It might be difficult to prove cause and effect between, say, the May events in Paris and the chaos at the Democratic convention in August, but as people might have said at the time, something was in the air. It wasn’t mere coincidence that led to youth revolts all over the world. In the case of 1989, such connections are even more obvious."

Maurizio Cattelan’s Shocking Window Displays at the Palais de Tokyo,2013-06-21,article,News,,['Art'],The supposedly retired Italian art provocateur has transformed the Paris museum with stomach-churning images from his magazine Toilet Paper.,"When the Italian polymath Maurizio Cattelan announced his retirement from the art world in 2011 on the eve of a major retrospective at the Guggenheim, few people really believed him, and for good reason.

Since its inaugural issue in 2010, the magazine has regularly published 2-D works with the same eccentric qualities as Cattelan’s sculptures. (An anthology was released last year.) Its spreads are scabrous and surreal, cartoonish and sublime: an eyeball staring from a man’s mouth, a playing card held between a woman’s buttocks, a half-eaten bar of soap. Though much of the work will elicit laughter, Cattelan and Ferrari take it very seriously. “Toilet Paper images are the realization of everyone’s most intimate, hidden and unspeakable desires and urges,” Cattelan said. “What makes a Toilet Paper image is the attempt to say something terrible while staying quiet.”"

What’s on Saturday,2013-06-22,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In this tribute to the Italian cinema of the 1950s and ’60s by Woody Allen, a retired, and overly psychoanalyzed, music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to an earnest lawyer devoted to left-wing causes (Flavio Parenti). Meanwhile in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and into the arms of a movie star while her befuddled husband tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penélope Cruz, above with Alessandro Tiberi) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) blown to smithereens when her neurotic actress friend (Ellen Page) shows up for a visit. Alec Baldwin plays the older architect — a ghost? a specter of the younger man’s self? — who witnesses the ordeal. “One of the most delightful things about ‘To Rome With Love’ is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The limitations of ‘To Rome With Love,’ as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights. Some of the scenes feel rushed and haphazardly constructed, and the dialogue frequently sounds overwritten and under-rehearsed. But this may just be to say that we are watching late-period Woody Allen. Complaining would be as superfluous — though also, perhaps, as inevitable — as psychoanalysis.”"

What’s on Sunday,2013-06-23,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (Lifetime) DEVIOUS MAIDS Subtitle this new series, which counts Eva Longoria among its executive producers, “Desperate Housekeepers.” Five maids bound by their personal struggles navigate the upstairs-downstairs attitudes of their Beverly Hills employers in this take on the telenovela “Ellas Son ... la Alegría del Hogar.” The story begins as one of their peers, Flora (Paula Garcés), is murdered in the home where she works during one of the year’s fanciest society events. Marisol, played by Ana Ortiz, works for some troubled newlyweds and tries to learn the truth about Flora’s death. Dania Ramírez is Rosie, who left her son in Mexico to work as a maid and nanny for a couple of uppity actors. Roselyn Sánchez is Carmen, an aspiring singer who would like her pop-star employer to help jump-start her career. And Zoila (Judy Reyes) and her teenage daughter (Edy Ganem, above right with, from left, Ms. Sánchez, Ms. Ramírez and Ms. Reyes) are the maids for an emotionally unstable but very wealthy woman. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley said that despite amusing touches, the show is “relentlessly arch and tongue in cheek in a way that seemed fresh when ‘Desperate Housewives’ began in 2004, but now is less so.” She added: “There is more to these hard-working women than their laundry skills — they are called devious for a reason — but the story lines and dialogue may be a bit too cute and contrived to hold viewers’ interest for long.” It’s the cast, she said, “that commands attention.” "

Mr. Kimball also speaks to scientists, who call the concentration of birds there “the Central Park effect,” and who, each Christmas season, attempt to count the birds in the park to produce the annual report of birds in decline.

What’s On Tuesday,2013-06-25,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"3:55 P.M. (TMC) SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998) Joseph Fiennes portrays Shakespeare as a struggling playwright cursed with the double whammy of writer’s block and a crisis of sexual confidence, and Gwyneth Paltrow is Viola, the literate, headstrong muse who inspires him to write “Romeo and Juliet” in this Oscar-winning film from the director John Madden. “Ingenious as the film’s many inventions happen to be (from boatmen who behave like cabbies to its equivalent of Shakespearean outtakes — ‘One Gentleman of Verona’ in the writing process), it could never have had so much energy without the right real-life Juliet to dazzle Will,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Ms. Paltrow, “in her first great, fully realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as the playwright’s guiding light. In a film steamy enough to start a sonnet craze, her Viola De Lesseps really does seem to warrant the most timeless love poems, and to speak Shakespeare’s own elegant language with astonishing ease. ‘Shakespeare in Love’ itself seems as smitten with her as the poet is, and as alight with the same love of language and beauty.” Ms. Paltrow won an Oscar for best actress; Judi Dench (above, with Colin Firth as Viola’s fiancé) for best supporting actress for her role as Queen Elizabeth; Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard for best screenplay; and the film for best picture."

Many other whites would work, like a Fiano di Avellino or, if you can get it, a carricante from Mount Etna.

Recently more human beings have been dying by suicide annually than by murder and warfare combined. Despite the progress made by science, medicine and mental-health care in the 20th century — the sequencing of our genome, the advent of antidepressants, the reconsidering of asylums and lobotomies — nothing has been able to drive down the suicide rate in the general population. In the United States, it has held relatively steady since 1942. Worldwide, roughly one million people kill themselves every year. Last year, more active-duty U.S. soldiers killed themselves than died in combat; their suicide rate has been rising since 2004. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the suicide rate among middle-aged Americans has climbed nearly 30 percent since 1999. In response to that widely reported increase, Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., appeared on PBS NewsHour and advised viewers to cultivate a social life, get treatment for mental-health problems, exercise and consume alcohol in moderation. In essence, he was saying, keep out of those demographic groups with high suicide rates, which include people with a mental illness like a mood disorder, social isolates and substance abusers, as well as elderly white males, young American Indians, residents of the Southwest, adults who suffered abuse as children and people who have guns handy."

Listen Up | The Moody Tunes of Dirty Beaches,2013-06-26,article,News,,['Music'],"Exclusive: T premieres the music video for “I Dream in Neon,” a song inspired by Alex Zhang Hungtai’s travels to Berlin.","“How you live your life eventually influences what you create,” said Alex Zhang Hungtai, better known by his moniker, Dirty Beaches. If that’s true, then Hungtai, who looks like a hipster Wong Kar-Wai character, has a lot of experiences to draw from for his music. Hungtai was born in Taiwan but has lived and worked in such diverse places as Montreal, Queens and Berlin, where the video for “I Dream in Neon” — featured exclusively above — was shot. It’s a moody, lo-fi single from his most recent album, “Drifters/Love Is the Devil,” on which many of the tracks are deliciously experimental and seem like they span decades, tiptoeing a thin line between a late ’60s garage band and a New Age ’80s pop group. “The album, and song, is a conglomeration of all of the past work I’ve done. I want people to come along for the ride,” he said. The music video, which he referred to as the loosely autobiographical story of his move to Germany, where he made part of this record, cuts in and out of shots of dimly lit classic cars zipping around foreboding streets. One might expect Ryan Gosling to pop out of the shadows at any moment — not a coincidence since Hungtai is “definitely obsessed” with the 2011 sleeper hit “Drive.” “I must have seen it about four times in theaters,” he admitted. “I have always been interested in road movies.” Perhaps that’s why the track seems like a trip to a dreamlike other world, not unlike his stage shows. Tonight, he performs at New York’s Mercury Lounge in the Lower East Side."

Francis Bacon’s Works Steal the Sale at Sotheby’s in London,2013-06-26,article,News,,"['Art', 'Auctions']","Two paintings by Francis Bacon were the stars of Sotheby’s sale of contemporary art in London on Wednesday night, when 68 works, including ones by David Hockney, Damien Hirst, Lucio Fontana, Andreas Gursky and John Currin, were also for sale.","LONDON — Two paintings by Francis Bacon — one of the artist’s favorite female model and another of a man peering at the viewer from behind a pair of delicate glasses — were the stars of Sotheby’s sale of contemporary art here on Wednesday night.It was the second night in a week of back-to-back auctions here, and the salesroom was overflowing with collectors and dealers. Most came to watch, but many bid as well. On offer were 68 works, including other examples by British artists like David Hockney and Damien Hirst, as well as an international array of blue-chip names — Lucio Fontana, Andreas Gursky and John Currin, to name a few.But while the evening brought some solid prices, it followed a similar pattern to Christie’s sale on Tuesday night. Both lacked the frenzy (and the stellar selection of material) that made up the New York sales in May. “We’re at the end of a marathon that started in New York, then moved to Hong Kong, Venice, Basel and now back to London,’’ said Harry Blain, a British dealer, ticking off the various events, including art fairs and auctions, that began in New York last month. “Still,’’ he added, “when something is rare people fight for it.’’The auction totaled $116.8 million, in the middle of its $101.2 million to $144.9 million estimate. Fifteen works failed to sell. The auction was bigger than the Christie’s event, which totaled $108.4 million, within its $86.4 million to $112 million estimate. Of the 64 works at that auction, 13 failed to sell.(Final prices include the buyer’s premium: 25 percent of the first $100,000; 20 percent from $100,000 to $2 million and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)Both Bacon canvases were being sold by William Acquavella, the New York dealer, according to several dealers familiar with the works. The best of them — “Three Studies of Isabel Rawsthorne’’ — was a 1966 triptych of Rawsthorne, an artist, who was Bacon’s confidante and model. Two bidders fought for the painting, which was purchased by Alex Corcoran of the Lefevre Gallery in London for $17.3 million. It had been estimated to bring $15.5 million to $23.3 million. Mr. Acquavella had bought the triptych at Christie’s in London nine years ago for $4.2 million. The second Bacon — “Head III’’ — a 1949 canvas of a man’s head peering eerily out at the viewer, was bought by an unidentified telephone bidder for $16.1 million, well above its $10.8 million high estimate.Abstract paintings have been all the rage recently and two works by Lucio Fontana commanded high prices. His “Concetto Spaziale, Le Chiese di Venezia,’’ a 1961 canvas inspired by the mosaics, frescoes, glass and stone of churches in Venice, which was expected to fetch $6.2 million to $9.3 million, went to a telephone bidder for $6.8 million. And Fontana’s 1965 “Concetto Spaziale, Attese,’’ a white canvas with his signature slashes that was expected to bring $5.1 million to $7 million, sold for $6.7 million to another telephone bidder.David Hockney is always a favorite in London, especially after his blockbuster exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts here last year. Both Hockney works artist brought higher than expected prices. “A Small Sunbather,’’ from 1967, depicting one of his famed subjects, swimming pools, had belonged to Stanley J. Seeger, the celebrated collector who died in 2011. Although it was expected to bring $467,000 to $780,000, it sold to a telephone bidder for $1.7 million. Mr. Seeger had bought the painting at Christie’s in New York 13 years ago for $270,000. A later Hockney work, “Double East Yorkshire,’’ a colorful landscape from 1998 that had been estimated to sell for $3.1 million to $4.6 million, went to another telephone bidder for $5.3 million.The sale also included five photographs by Andreas Gursky depicting stock exchanges around the world. They were being sold by Greg Coffey, a former hedge fund manager living in London. Among the best of them was “Chicago Board of Trade III,’’ which was estimated at $935,000 to $1.2 million and went to a telephone bidder for $3.3 million."

In “TransAtlantic,” he’s used the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean — made in 1919 by the British aviators John Alcock and Arthur Brown — as a catalyst. In both novels these acts of bravery and skill become metaphors for more everyday acts of daring, while at the same time serving as narrative anchors for Mr. McCann’s kaleidoscopic look at an expanding circle of lives.

But they were far from modern by present-day standards. In fact, the culture of the Naga was nearly destroyed by modern Europeans. First came mid-19-century subjugation by the British, who wanted to stop the irritation of headhunting raids on neighboring Indian territories. Then American Baptist missionaries invaded, eventually succeeding in almost totally suppressing the Naga’s “satanic” practices and converting nearly all of the population to nominal Christianity."

But as Jon Mooallem discovers in his ambitious and fascinating first book, “Wild Ones,” American conservation today presents a far greater conundrum than deciding what to save or even how to save it. Such efforts force us to reconsider our relationship with other species and to confront what may be our obsolete fantasy of “wilderness.” Most of all, they force us to rethink the human animal. "

But none are quite as deranged as the narrator of “The Cask of Amontillado.” His name is Montresor, and his story opens with a threat: “The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge.” What a wealth of pathology is revealed in these words; it becomes immediately clear that the “thousand injuries” Montresor mentions are less harmful to him than the “insult” he claims to have suffered."

That a Nation Might Live,2013-06-28,article,Review,,"['Civil War (US) (1861-65)', 'Books and Literature']","At Gettysburg, nothing less than the whole war was at stake.","The battle of Gettysburg was a human and environmental catastrophe and, for the United States, almost the beginning of the end of its existence. Any historian contemplating this event faces numerous daunting problems — apart from the fact that thousands of books and articles have already been published on the Gettysburg campaign. The ghastly scale of bloodletting has to be explained. The battlefield contest itself involved the highest possible political and national stakes. And although this may be the most documented battle ever, the historian must use a vast supply of unreliable postwar recollections as sources. Such issues never stem the tide of writers drawn by the intellectual challenge (or by the charms of the subject’s market). "

Small Betrayals,2013-06-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Set against an international backdrop, Lily Tuck’s story collection traces the emotional terrain of faltering relationships.","In “My Flame,” one of the stories in Lily Tuck’s new collection, “The House at Belle Fontaine,” a woman finds out, long after her ex-husband’s death, that he repeatedly slept with his teenage niece. The girl is also dead, having driven drunk. So betrayal, in a not uncommon phenomenon, has a longer life than its perpetrators: the many intervening years cannot prevent the protagonist from feeling “shocked and duped.” Such a bald statement of feeling is rare for Tuck, a writer chary with reports of her characters’ inner lives. We’re not often privy to their reflections; their thoughts tend toward memories that are not especially emotional, or local observations or desires. “She hoped the bus would not be late as it was her day to car pool.” “It might be nice, for a change, to have another female in the house.” “Dr. Harris-Mehta’s white coat, Helen notices, is buttoned up the wrong way and, briefly, she is tempted to reach over and fix it.” "
Sightseeing,2013-06-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A professor and his former student on their island honeymoon.,"“A tiny, perfect, whittled trinket found bedded in the sand”; “a brightness quivering against the coming rain”; “a modern-day Venus” who inspires “a fin-de-siècle fever”: these are a few descriptions of the young wife in “Orkney,” Amy Sackville’s masterfully self-contained second novel. If they sound dismayingly vague and romantic, that’s because the words belong not to the writer, but to the narrator, Richard, a professor who has recently married his most gifted student. She asks him to take her to the sea, and he gallantly makes arrangements for a honeymoon in the northern Scottish archipelago of Orkney, giving no thought to what she will do once he must return to his academic responsibilities. “We talked once of her working on her doctorate with me,” he muses, “but that would be impossible now.” When he thinks of their future, he imagines “a perpetual breakfast table.”"

Extreme States of Mind,2013-06-28,article,Review,,"['Poetry and Poets', 'Books and Literature']","Frank Bidart’s latest poems look back at the precedents — literary, cinematic and sexual — that shaped him as an adult.","Frank Bidart got noticed during the 1970s and ’80s for poems that did not sound like poems at all: a disjointed monologue by a serial killer, another by Ludwig Binswanger’s anorexic and ultimately suicidal patient Ellen West and, later, disquisitions on the history of philosophy, in spiky free verse full of capital letters, italics, white space and unconventional punctuation. Bidart’s extreme typography helped him convey extreme states of mind; it also helped show how his lines ought to sound, read aloud. More recent and more traditionally lyrical books have taken on well-defined topics: “Desire” (1997) was largely about sex, “Watching the Spring Festival” (2008) about beauty."

It had become an immutable part of the drill: at the completion of the flight the astronaut’s wife had to leave the house and confront the Beast and all his cameras and microphones and submit to a press conference and answer questions and be the perfect Astronaut’s Wife with merely the entire world watching. It was this grim prospect that truly lacerated one’s heart while Mr. Wonderful was aloft. It was this that gave the test pilot’s wife a royal case of nerves in the space age.”"

The performances of Michael C. Hall as the diffident psychopath Dexter Morgan and Jennifer Carpenter as his ferocious, intensely vulnerable, hilariously profane adopted sister, Deb, are the yin and yang of the series. Dexter’s protectiveness of Deb helps to redeem him; she is, in Ms. Carpenter’s hands, so vivid and appealing that we like him for loving her."
