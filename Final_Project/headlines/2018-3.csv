The fault lines are mainly financial — she’s the breadwinner and he’s a failed athlete reduced to drywalling their rambling fixer-upper — but they run deep. And when the near-fatal collision kicks loose a cascade of poor decisions and worse outcomes, the couple’s increasingly violent behavior blooms as much from hidden resentments as visible threats."

"Sex, Lies and Subterfuge Roil Joyce Carol Oates’s New Story Collection",2018-03-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Whether they’re lovers, parents, professors or kids, the characters in these stories all have something to hide.","The title of Joyce Carol Oates’s new collection of stories, “Beautiful Days,” is drawn from “Les Beaux Jours,” a painting by Balthus of a girl reclining in a chair and examining herself in a hand mirror, while a faceless man tends the fireplace behind her. But it might equally refer to “Fleuve Blue” or “Big Burnt,” the first two stories in the book — which are about (among other things) the strange disconnection that separates our romantic lives from the rest of life. “Fleuve Blue” describes an affair between a prominent small-town lawyer and a younger woman, whom he first sees walking across a bridge. He thinks, “I will marry her. That one.” Except, of course, he’s already married. Later, he offers her a ride when she gets caught wearing high heels in a downpour and they start meeting in the afternoon in a rented room. “She told him it would be the inside-out of the rest of her life, her relationship with him. … She meant, what they had together was a counter-world. … ‘Because I’m always lying. In that other life. In my “real” life. I tell people — I tell myself — “I live for my children. I adore my children.”’ ” Unsurprisingly, their affair turns out to be susceptible to the same sort of forces that she wants to escape in her real life — boredom and the passage of time."

"Review: In ‘Shining Moon,’ Two Gay Chilean Actors Confront the Past",2018-03-08,article,Review,,['Movies'],"This film, from the Chilean director Gustavo Letelier, is oddly enticing in its experimental awkwardness.","“Your love is going away like water in the fingers,” complains Renato (Ricardo Herrera) to his lover, Ivan (Pablo Sotomayor Prat), near the beginning of “Shining Moon” (“El Destello de la Luna”), the new film from the Chilean director Gustavo Letelier.

He describes two ways of approaching the world: “You can walk on the path, or you can walk through the hedge.” It’s almost a given that this documentary about his ephemeral, nature-based art will eventually show him trudging through a hedge, oblivious to or uninterested in the perfectly functional sidewalk next to it."

There is a notable drive toward streamlining, with fewer galleries this year — a total of 198 from 31 countries at Piers 92/94, the contiguous exhibition space. The timeline is being tightened, as well, to create less of a divide between the past and the present, between post-World War II art (usually found on the sleepier Pier 92) and newer work. It’s a smart move, since much “historical” art from the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s is now being shown in contemporary galleries anyway."

While he aspired to be invisible — to the point of refusing to be photographed and conducting all interviews by fax or email — Margiela’s impact is writ large on the contemporary fashion landscape. So many of his innovations — once radical — have become accepted norms in the industry (his deconstructed tailoring, his championing of recycling and his pioneering of the see-now buy-now model, to name but a few). Brands as diverse as Vetements, Marques’Almeida and The Row continually mine his archive for inspiration. The conceptual Belgian designer is being celebrated in two separate exhibitions in Paris this month: a retrospective at the Palais Galliera, which examines his career until he retired in 2009, and another at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, which premiered in Antwerp last year and catalogs his six-year tenure designing for Hermès.

Most often she is a princess of the depths, with alabaster skin, a giant fin in place of legs and breasts covered by a mess of long, tangled hair. Her appeal, though, is not merely aesthetic. For centuries, men have braved the open waters, knowing full well they may never make it home, and the mermaid has served as either a kind of ballast in times of trouble, saving sailors from floods and deadly storms, or a figure of seduction, luring them to their deaths at the bottom of the ocean. Her passivity, as well as her beguiling exoticness, is an escape from whatever drudgery awaits these men back on land — the mermaid is a fantasy, yes, but also a way to explain the unexplainable in nature. The admiral on one of Christopher Columbus’s expeditions once mistook a manatee, its silky gray curves moving gently through the Caribbean waters, for one."

This would take a while to bring positive results, but Hinkie implored fans to ignore the team’s losses and look at the big picture. “We talk a lot about process,” he said, “not outcome.”"

During its reign, his namesake shop-cum-gallery in SoHo, which opened in 1994 and closed in 2012, defined avant-garde good taste. Moss blurred the lines between art and design and reinvented visual merchandising, displaying everything from an 18th-century Nymphenburg figurine to a kaleidoscopic array of Maarten Baas Clay chairs inside massive vitrines within the immaculate white space.

But to this day, Moss still considers his childhood growing up in the suburbs of ’60s Chicago to be his most formative period. When his father insisted on installing electric hand-dryers and Borax soap dispensers in the bathrooms of their home, his mother agreed, provided their decorator could enamel them in pink and turquoise pastels. “To me, that epitomized what Modernism should be,” Moss says. “I’ve been fascinated by the juxtaposition of the industrial and the decorative ever since.”"

Now, a new group runs the hotel, and he was approached again. “They asked if I believed in fate,” said the veteran chef, who is 47. “And they gave me a chance to do my brainchild, my dream.” His menu features French techniques with Korean ingredients, reflecting his background and his years in the kitchens of chefs like Wayne Nish, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Laurent Tourondel. His kimchi bouillabaisse is based on a South Korean fish stew, and his Korean beef bourguignon is similar to the long, slow French braise.

Review: ‘12 Days’ and the Rights of the Mentally Ill,2018-03-15,article,Review,,"['Documentary Films and Programs', 'Mental Health and Disorders', 'Human Rights and Human Rights Violations']","In this lucid documentary, the veteran filmmaker Raymond Depardon explores French law and the care of psychiatric patients.","An uneasy calm suffuses “12 Days,” a documentary set at the juncture of personal liberty and the law. An opening title card offers some context: Since 2013, patients in France who have been involuntarily committed to psychiatric hospitals must be “presented to a freedom and detention judge” within 12 days and then, if needed, every six months. That’s pretty much all the background that the director Raymond Depardon provides in this movie, which suggests that the line between mental illness and health is sometimes determined by who tells your story and how. For those who have long been silenced — and often remain so — being able to tell those stories is clearly monumental."

And while Dara Horn’s novel “Eternal Life” takes organized religion as one theme— it unfolds against the backdrop of 2,000 years of Jewish history — it also features a heroine who comes to understand, through love, why everyone around her clings so hard to life."

In the ’70s, Gordon, now 68, graduated from college to a life in letters, and she memorized lines from “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” a 1971 film directed by John Schlesinger and starring Jackson as Alex, a woman competing with a doctor, played by Peter Finch, for the love of a young male sculptor and coming to terms with free love. As Gordon’s novels and nonfiction — including an important 1978 essay on abortion rights published in the New York Review of Books — won her increasing acclaim, she watched Jackson, now a two-time Oscar winner, make a turn to a surprising second career as a liberal member of Parliament beginning in 1992. Finally, and just as surprisingly, Jackson returned to acting. Just after turning 80 two years ago, she won raves in London as a gender-blind King Lear. This spring brings Jackson back to Broadway, starring in the revival of Edward Albee’s 1991 play “Three Tall Women,” which opens March 29, about a woman recalling her life’s great triumphs and regrets. One morning in January in Manhattan, Gordon finally met her idol for a long conversation, which covered poetry, film and theater, but most significantly the state of feminism today."

One gang, called La Familia Michoacana, announced its presence about a decade ago by tossing five rivals’ heads onto a dance floor in the town of Uruapan. The Knights Templar muscled in next, spouting a chivalric code of honor as it taxed, extorted and kidnapped farmers and usurped their land. Mexican security forces and local landowners have tried to fight back, but warring cartels continue to splinter and proliferate. In March, an armed group known as Los Viagras — apparently named for the way their leader’s heavily moussed hair stands up — wreaked havoc by burning dozens of vehicles and effectively shutting down the state’s main highway. One conflagration took place not far from where an American businessman named Steve Barnard owns a packing plant in Uruapan. “It’s too dangerous to drive on the roads,” Barnard says. The farm owners “have to be very careful not to get kidnapped.”"

Letter of Recommendation: Fatbergs,2018-03-27,article,News,,"['Museums', 'Waste Materials and Disposal']",A hideous collective self-portrait rendered in oil and wet wipes.,"The promise of a modern sewage system is the freedom to forget that the waste goes somewhere. It’s an indulgence that quickly hardens into abuse — which, in turn, hardens into something else altogether. Over the years, in London, millions of tiny droplets of cooking oil have been funneled down into the city’s underbelly from the drains of fried-chicken shops and curry houses, slipping past grease traps in a swirl of wastewater. At the same time, in homes all across town, wet wipe after wet wipe has been flushed out of sight and into the mix, where their plasticized fibers formed a skeleton around which the fat could accrete. Slowly, the incipient mass began to trap tampons, condoms and often a discarded needle or two in its oily matrix, eventually growing into a monstrous subterranean clot the length of 22 double-decker buses with the weight of a blue whale: the Whitechapel Fatberg."
