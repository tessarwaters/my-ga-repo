You could create what’s sometimes called a fruit-­cocktail tree by grafting a nectarine together with, say, a peach, a plum and an apricot, or manipulating a lemon tree to also grow grapefruits. But Barnett prefers a more traditional approach. “Keep apples with apples and pears with pears,” he says."

(Interviewing her for The Los Angeles Times recently, the author Meredith Maran began, “Tell me why I shouldn’t hate you.”) But in publishing as in politics, a big war chest alone doesn’t necessarily ensure success. “Money is very important,” the eminent publisher Howard Kaminsky told this newspaper in 1985, in an article headlined “Why Best Sellers Sell Best, and Other Publishing Secrets.” (The short version: Nobody knows.) “But there’s no guarantee of money making something happen. You need a book with intrinsic value, even if it’s frivolous intrinsic value.” Now Sweeney’s novel is out, and early reviews confirm that “The Nest” — a dark comedy about adult siblings squabbling over their lost inheritance — is worth the buzz. Still, Sweeney has maintained a sense of perspective. “We’re not people who are flashily trying to get attention,” she said of herself and her writer friends in a recent profile in New York magazine. “Whatever props we get, it’s just because we’re diligent workers.” Or, as she put it in her interview with Maran: “It’s not like I went out there saying, ‘I’ll only accept a million dollars for this book.’ It’s lunacy, that much money. On the other hand, I wish the publishing world was structured differently, so an author getting paid a lot for her book wasn’t such a rare thing that it’s news. I wrote the book I wanted to write. I was just hoping someone would want it.” She can stop worrying on that count: “The Nest” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 3."

Photographed from 1989-90, “Kitchen Table” earned labels like “career-making” and is considered the moment when Weems, 62 — who has received the MacArthur “genius” grant and U.S. Department of State’s Medal of Arts — “found her artistic voice.” Institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art have exhibited part of, or the entirety of, the 20 photos and 14 text panels during the last three decades. But, despite the series’ significance, and its total adaptability, it hadn’t been published on its own — until now. The idea came about when the graphic designer Takaaki Matsumoto approached Weems several years ago. “‘Kitchen Table’ has been printed many times, but never as a stand-alone book,” she says. “This is the first time that anyone has asked to focus on the series as its own entity. I am grateful to him for both designing and publishing the work, because it needed to stand on its own.”"

There’s nothing much amiss at first about the soiree in the low-budget chiller “The Invitation.” Most of the guests look as comfortable as the setting, a modernist lair wedged into a Los Angeles hillside. Still, there’s something off about the hostess, who’s slinking around barefoot wearing a vacant smile and a long white dress. It’s the kind of number that Joan Didion might once have slipped on for another beautiful-people night of anomie and booze."

Rules in fashion are made by the industry: the editors, the designers, the corporations who fund the whole thing. And so, genuine rule-breakers don’t come along that often. Fashion enjoys the status quo. It sells clothes, it makes money."

Review: Recycled ‘Jungle Book’ Puts a Real Boy in a Forest of Pixels,2016-04-14,article,Review,,['Movies'],"This Disney redo, by Jon Favreau, is a live-action movie that’s heavy on C.G.I. and a sunny vibe borrowed from the 1967 original.","Disney’s new take on “The Jungle Book” is being touted as a live-action movie, though there’s scarcely anything alive in it.

Inside the List,2016-04-22,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Annette Gordon-Reed, at No. 16 in nonfiction with a new book about Thomas Jefferson, says this political season raises “questions about the fundamental nature of democracy in the United States.”","Founders Day: In the middle of a weird primary season, one secondary weirdness has surfaced on the nonfiction lists — after a flurry last fall, the usual campaign books are nowhere in sight. That’s not to say political books aren’t selling. But instead of history in the making, readers are ­opting for history already made. This week, ­Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Hamilton: The Revolution” — written with Jeremy McCarter, it’s a look at Miranda’s hit musical about Alexander Hamilton — enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1. At the same time, Ron Chernow’s 2004 biography “Alexander Hamilton,” which inspired the musical, is No. 2 in its 27th week on the paperback list. And a new biography of Thomas Jefferson, “ ‘Most Blessed of the Patriarchs,’ ” by Annette Gordon-Reed and Peter S. Onuf, enters the hardcover list at No. 16. Are readers turning to these books for context, as a reprieve or for some other reason entirely? I asked Gordon-Reed what she thought. “Peter and I have talked a lot about the strangeness of this political season,” she replied. “So many of the bizarre things that have happened raise questions about the fundamental nature of democracy in the United States. Could this have been our destination all along? Maybe people are now, even more than usual, feeling the need to look at how it all got started and are seeking out books that may give them a clue. The cliché about not being able to know where you’re going until you know where you’ve been may be in operation here. In the face of uncertainty about the future, people are looking to the past.”"

They bang the drums like never before. From the organization that administers the SAT, they buy the names of students who have scored above a certain mark and are at least remotely plausible, persuadable applicants, then they send those students pamphlets and literature that grow glossier and more alluring — that leafy quadrangle! those gleaming microscopes! — by the year.

‘Sports Detectives’ Tracks Down Famed Memorabilia,2016-04-29,article,News,,['Television'],An episode focusing on Jim Brown’s 1964 championship ring and the Immaculate Reception.,"Fans who gorge on TV coverage of the National Football League draft can turn to the Smithsonian Channel for a digestif on Sunday, May 1: a football-themed episode of a new series called “Sports Detectives.” Each installment tries to track down or determine the authenticity of sports memorabilia, and here the objects in question are the 1964 championship ring that belonged to the Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown and the football that ricocheted into the arms of the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Franco Harris in the 1972 play known as the Immaculate Reception. The findings by the “detectives” — Lauren Gardner, a sports reporter, and Kevin Barrows, a private investigator — aren’t always definitive, but the fun is in the revisiting of these moments. (The series premiere on April 24 concerned the flag that draped the goalie Jim Craig after the United States hockey team’s gold medal victory at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1980.) And, especially in the segment on the ring, a story that involves a divorce and a possible burglary, the quests provide a window into the sometimes murky sports-memorabilia world."

Ryan McNamara’s ‘Battleground’ Invokes Costume and Conquest at the Guggenheim,2016-04-29,article,News,,['Dancing'],The multidisciplinary creator draws impishly on a form of performance art for the museum’s Works & Process series.,"In a 2010 piece called “Make Ryan a Dancer,” the multidisciplinary artist Ryan McNamara submitted himself, over a period of months under public scrutiny, to the invigorating but daunting task of learning to dance.

With sci-fi and fantasy in mind, he turns the museum’s intimate Peter B. Lewis Theater into the titular battleground, dividing it into three war zones, and musters nine dancers to serve in competing armies. The audience sits in the line of fire.

But to view the quotation above as a kind of library motivational poster, a fawning slogan for literacy, would be to rob it of the arch comedy that always and everywhere makes Austen sparkle. That’s because the speaker here is petty Caroline Bingley, who in fact cares nothing for books and hopes merely to attract the studious Mr. Darcy. Needless to say, it doesn’t work. (In the 2009 adaptation “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” by Seth Grahame-Smith, Darcy deflects her advance with this memorable reply: “Spoken like one who has never known the ecstasy of holding a still-beating heart in her hand.” But I think Austen’s original, in which he ignores her and silently keeps reading, is just as wicked.)"
