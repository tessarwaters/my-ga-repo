A Quarantine Activity for the Wine Lover,2020-05-06,article,News,,"['Wines', 'Quarantine (Life and Culture)']",Família Geisse from Brazil sells a sparkling wine that you disgorge yourself.,"I’ve sabered open a bottle of Champagne. But disgorging one? Yes, try this at home. Just follow the step-by-step that comes with Família Geisse’s Cave Amadeu Rústico Nature from southern Brazil. In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally it’s done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommery’s chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. It’s best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it what’s called a pét-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate. Disgorging is worth trying at least once, and understanding what lees contribute to the wine made it doubly worthwhile."

‘Arkansas’ Review: A Mumblecore Mob Drama,2020-05-07,article,Review,,['Movies'],"Clark Duke’s film takes an unusual perspective on a familiar genre but is weighed down by its dull, uneven pace.","Adapted from the writer John Brandon’s eponymous 2008 novel, “Arkansas” intercuts the escapades of a pair of low-level drug couriers with the back story of their mysterious mafia boss.

That may sound like the premise of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” and, coincidentally, this film shares a director with the second and third installments of the original Swedish trilogy. Perhaps that’s why Daniel Alfredson’s filmmaking feels most confident in this, the final entry of his thematically connected “Intrigo” series (now available on digital and on demand). The films take place in the fictional European town of Maardam, but the setting feels most fully realized here, with cameras panning the seemingly idyllic pastoral scenery of Samaria, the farm where the movie’s mystery is centered."

Let’s Talk It Out,2020-05-07,article,Review,,['Movies'],"Talia Balsam gets a rare chance to shine in a lead role in this sharp domestic drama, playing a woman who learns of her partner’s second family.","Talia Balsam is a paragon of acting talent who doesn’t get nearly as many opportunities to fully stand out as she ought.

But the pilgrims on my flight from South Korea had an altogether different purpose. It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission — the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name."

Today, traveling through them reawakens a distant, though not forgotten, past.","IT WAS OCTOBER in Tashkent. The broad Soviet-style avenues of Uzbekistan’s capital were lined with chestnut and Oriental plane, their leaves turning russet in the crisp autumn air. This city of 2.5 million had, in Soviet days, which lasted from the 1920s until the country’s independence in 1991, been the premier capital of Central Asia. It is home to more than half of Uzbekistan’s 116 universities, and on that first golden morning in Tashkent, there was something of the glazed perfection of a Soviet propaganda poster in the sight of students in twos and threes strolling down the runway-size avenues. They were dwarfed by the giant buildings that lined the roads — banks, museums and ministries — “Babylonian blocks,” as the English writer Philip Glazebrook, who had been in Tashkent at the end of Soviet rule, described them in “Journey to Khiva” in the early ’90s: “Since the days of Nineveh this has been the architecture of dictatorship and persecution.” And so it was, but after my late arrival on the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul, I found myself oddly in sympathy with the ideal, if not the reality, of Soviet life."

This is architecture meant to set the soul asoar, but I am conscious only of how far I am below, in the horde at the gates.

What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Ophelia’ and ‘Solar Opposites’,2020-05-13,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",A spin on Shakespeare airs on Showtime. And a new animated sitcom with ties to “Rick and Morty” is on Hulu.,"OPHELIA (2019) 10 p.m. on Showtime. The suggestion that Shakespeare wrote “King Lear” during plague lockdown has been widely circulated recently (online, at least), and some ambitious souls may be inspired to take advantage of social distancing to try to write the next great play, novel or TV pilot. For the rest of us, catching up on movies will have to suffice. One option, for those who missed it, is this revisionist take on “Hamlet.” As the title suggests, the movie takes the characters and plot of that Shakespeare play but gives them its own spin: It focuses on Ophelia (Daisy Ridley), the lover of Hamlet (George MacKay), who gets her own story line here as the action of the play takes a back seat. Directed by Claire McCarthy and based on a young adult novel by Lisa Klein, the movie makes for an “interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. This, Dargis added, is “Ophelia as a 21st-century heroine, who after a smudge-faced childhood running wild in her king’s castle — and being excluded from studying with the boys — grows into a woman with desires, ambitions and a pronounced rebellious streak.”"

This will mean firing large numbers of adjunct professors, some of whom will lose their health insurance, in the middle of a pandemic. (Mass firings have already started at other CUNY campuses, 450 to date at John Jay alone; they could happen at Brooklyn any day.) Remaining classes will then swell, which is bad for in-person education, but worse if classes remain online, as anybody who has tried to teach on Zoom can attest. The administration has said the projected savings from terminating adjuncts and ballooning classes at Brooklyn College would be $1.4 million. On the scale of New York State’s budget, the system’s main funding source, that’s a rounding error; for our adjuncts and our students, it’s a disaster. After years of being brutalized by Albany, CUNY has apparently so thoroughly internalized the backward logic of austerity that it responds to crisis by attacking itself."

An Artist Who Delights in the Minor Key,2020-05-29,article,News,,"['Art', 'Books and Literature', 'Photography', 'Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming']","Moyra Davey’s work moves freely between photography, video and writing but is united in its unwavering attention to the objects and accidents of everyday life.","In “I Confess,” the final essay in Moyra Davey’s new collection of prose pieces, “Index Cards” (2020), she recalls losing, as a child at school, a pencil given to her by her mother. Thinking it was stolen, she began to sob. Her teacher asked her: “Pourquoi as-tu tant de peine pour un crayon?” (Why so much grief over a pencil?)

An acute chronicler of quotidian life, she is both the narrator and protagonist of her work. She paces her apartment hallways in her videos; she photographs the dust under her bed; she reads and writes restlessly, hoping to find what Walter Benjamin called the “tiny spark of accident” that will set off stray thoughts and images. “Index Cards,” which she wrote between 2003 to 2019, reads like a serial novel and distills Davey’s methodology: Her art is rooted in finding a way to practice and is a record of its own creation."
