October 10 was the anniversary of an uprising in 1911 that led to the creation of the Republic of China, and it was celebrated in Taiwan by a massive military parade through the streets of the capital, Taipei.

Faison, board president of the Ebony Society of Philatelic Events and Reflections, a group dedicated to the collection of stamps relating to the African diaspora.

Faison’s themes include Black history, women and health care and science (she works as a senior medical director at Pfizer). Among her collection’s highlights: an illustrated Swedish stamp of Toni Morrison, released after her 1993 Nobel Prize in Literature, and a sheet of 10-cent stamps featuring Booker T. Washington, the first African-American person put on a U.S. stamp, in 1940. Faison’s older brother, Walter, who serves on the board with her, collects Martin Luther King Jr. stamps from around the world."

Up to that point, serving in the military seemed like more than sufficient civic engagement and provided a ready excuse for voluntarily opting out of several elections. By the time Barack Obama won the Democratic primary, I was an officer who’d spent more than a decade in the Navy and not a second in a voting booth. This apathy does not run in the blood. My parents are products of the civil rights era and the Jim Crow South, and as such religiously exercised their hard-won right to vote. In my formative years, the basic disposition of the house politics pressed together progressive demands for racial equality with the Black conservatism of marathon church services that stretched deep into Southern Sunday afternoons. We differed in degree on any number of issues, but elections were where our politics really diverged. Like much of Black America, my mother is a lifelong Democrat, staying true even as the party vacillated in and out of her good graces. My father is a somewhat perfunctory Republican, an heirloom affiliation inherited from Black Americans’ early-20th-century preference for the party of Lincoln and consecrated in the familial name carried by my grandfather, father and me: Theodore Roosevelt Johnson."

Once reserved for the cigar rooms of English gentlemen’s clubs, Saint Laurent’s black grain de poudre blazer with silk satin lapels, worn with a cummerbund, ruffled jabot blouse and bow tie over side-striped slacks, shocked the sartorial world: It was the first time a women’s designer had presented trousers for evening wear. But it quickly became the uniform of liberated women: The model Bianca Jagger wore a white version when she married Mick in 1971. The singer Françoise Hardy arrived at the opera in Paris dressed in a Smoking (and was heckled). And when the socialite Nan Kempner was famously turned away from the Manhattan restaurant La Côte Basque while wearing the tux (their dress code prohibited women from wearing pants), she slipped off her trousers and turned the blazer into a minidress. Saint Laurent would include a variation of Le Smoking in each of his collections until he retired in 2002, designing over 200 of them."

Of course, what elicits that sort of response from them is highly idiosyncratic, informed as much by their travels as the architecture of Northern Italy, where they grew up. The result is a collection that looks like no other and attracts clients such as the Italian director Luca Guadagnino, who featured one of the company’s abstract florals in his 2017 film, “Call Me by Your Name”; the Italian interior designer Michele Bönan, who installed their elegant-but-durable upholstery throughout the J.K.

Are Mushrooms the Future of Wellness?,2020-09-18,article,News,,"['Mushrooms', 'Vitamins', 'Sleep', 'Fungi', 'Anxiety and Stress', 'Herbs', 'Alternative and Complementary Medicine', 'Diet and Nutrition']","Long thought to have medicinal benefits, fungi including reishi, lion’s mane and chaga are gaining popularity in the wellness world.","Even before the onset of the pandemic, which has increased the demand for all manner of so-called organic immunity elixirs, wellness-minded Americans were warming to mushrooms. To be clear, mushrooms don’t cure Covid-19, but they are thought to provide a host of other benefits, from serving as an aphrodisiac to bolstering one’s defenses to toxins. As Ligaya Mishan explains in her essay for T’s Fall Men’s issue, Eastern cultures have long been enthusiastic about edible fungi, both in culinary and health contexts — mushrooms are rich in umami, the Japanese “fifth taste” that denotes savoriness, and woody species such as reishi are often prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine — while the West has been more ambivalent. Today, though, American cooks and diners delight in foraged morels and matsutakes, while others mix mushroom-based powders into shakes and teas. In an article published in 2014 — over 80 years after the British scientist Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, the powerful group of antibiotics derived from the fungus Penicillium — the mycologist Paul Stamets, best known for the TED Talk “6 Ways Mushrooms Can Save the World,” described mushrooms as “nature’s miniature pharmaceutical factories.”"

Most notable is its Vieilles Vignes Françaises, produced only from pre-phylloxera pinot noir grapes, grown on a couple of tiny plots. Now it has introduced an entirely new blanc de noirs, PN VZ 15, a nonvintage blend of wines with a base of the 2015 from the commune of Verzenay, with additions dating back to the 2009 vintage. The wine is full bodied, with ripe pears, apricots and a hint of chanterelles on the palate. It’s food-friendly and excellent alongside scrambled eggs with black truffles (my ideal lunch when visiting the Champagne region). Its price is reasonable, relatively speaking, for such a wine (Bollinger’s Vieilles Vignes Françaises is around $500)."

Design for the Future When the Future Is Bleak,2020-09-28,article,News,,"['Design', 'Earth', 'Agriculture and Farming', 'Greenhouse Gas Emissions', 'Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)']","Amid pandemics and environmental disasters, designers and architects have been forced to imagine a world in which the only way to move forward is to look back.","AT ITS CORE, design is an inherently futurist medium. In the 1960s, as the writer Maggie Gram has noted, key figures in the Modern design movement often used the word “design” indistinguishably from the word “planning.” This isn’t surprising: Design, like planning, was the profession most concerned with the future. Today is not so different, but what we mean by “the future,” a utopian ideal throughout much of the 20th century, is now undeniably much darker as we progress further into the 21st. To look ahead at what role design will play on an increasingly troubled planet takes us back to the fundamental polysemy behind the word itself. At various times it has encompassed drawing and architecture, products and graphics — in fact, everything short of the creation of the world itself (and, in the risible concept of “intelligent design,” sometimes that, too). Once industrial design became a profession in the early 20th century, the promiscuity of its aims and undefined nature of its objectives meant that designers felt they could do very nearly anything. In its most heroic phase, the mid-20th century, industrial designers gave themselves over to pronouncements that suggested they alone held the key to this savage parade. “What are the boundaries of design?” was the question posed in 1969 to Charles Eames, who, with his partner, Ray, designed chairs, toys, housing, films, exhibitions and, to a certain extent, the very nature of communication. Eames responded, “What are the boundaries of problems?”"

In the aughts, when his focus was apparel (he ran Edun, the clothing company started by Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson), he created loose silhouettes from linen and cotton dyed with coffee, blue corn and gardenia blossoms. In recent years, he has concentrated on furniture, lighting and sculpture, all with his signature futuristic, biomorphic contours, using bronze, gypsum, wood and plaster. This massive fireplace surround may be the ultimate expression of his aesthetic: Just over eight feet tall and nearly as wide, it is sculpted from a heat-tolerant marble composite that has a velvety matte finish — the stone is ground to a powder and combined with resin and ceramic fiber insulation.

Read the magazine’s five-month investigation.","On an October morning four years ago, eight young staff members at the Indiana Voter Registration Project in Indianapolis were planning their final steps before a closely contested presidential election. In recent weeks they had registered 45,000 new voters, most of whom were Black and Latino, and they were on track to enlist 10,000 more before Election Day. Their work had gone smoothly for the most part, but several canvassers had submitted applications with names that appeared to have been made up or drawn from the phone book, most likely to create the appearance that they were doing more work than they had actually done.

The staff members stopped using the suspect canvassers, but they couldn’t simply trash the faulty registrations: State law required them to file every application they collected, even if they had false names or serious mistakes. So they carefully identified all the applications with potentially false names, along with several hundred more with incorrect addresses or other simple errors, so that local election clerks would know they might present a problem."
