The Clinton Magic,2012-09-06,article,News,,[],What Bill Clinton did for Democrats (and to Republicans) last night.,"In a sweeping, sprawling, drawling 48-minute stemwinder of a speech last night, the former President of the United States drove a rhetorical truck through the biggest opening that Mitt Romney and the Republicans created for Democrats last week. The G.O.P. convention promised to make difficult choices and hard calls and be bracingly honest with the public, but the Republican speakers discussed policy in only the broadest and loosest terms, eschewing detail in favor of generalizations and creativity in favor of boilerplate. In response, Bill Clinton did everything they didn’t, diving deep on policy detail, covering issues ranging from Medicaid to welfare to prescription drugs to student loans, and effectively defining the Republicans — defining them negatively, it need hardly be said — on a range of issues where they declined to define themselves. Writing on Paul Ryan last week, I said that we shouldn’t be surprised that his speech was less wonky than his reputation, since a VP address is “hardly the time to talk about block grants and premium support and whether to peg spending rates to inflation or G.D.P. plus one percent.” But Clinton reminded us that this need not be true — that it’s possible to get wonky without losing your audience, and to embrace policy detail as a weapon against your opponents. Journalists tend to assume that voters tune policy substance out, and when the substance is delivered droningly or too abstractly no doubt they often do. But for the most effective rhetoricians, the mere act of talking in detail about the work of government can be a more effective way to persuade the public that you’re serious than a hundred vague promises to “make the hard choices” and “level with the American people.”"

By then a correspondent on assignment for William Lloyd Garrison’s newspaper The Liberator, Jacobs was a former slave and author of the book “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,” which she wrote under the assumed name Linda Brent. Traveling through Maryland, where slavery was still legal, and Pennsylvania, where anti-black animus still ran high, would have made for tough going for most free blacks.

Lost Tracks,2012-09-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Michael Chabon’s new novel is set in and around a used record store in Northern California.,"“Telegraph Avenue,” Michael Chabon’s rich, comic new novel, is a homage to an actual place: the boulevard in Northern California where Oakland — historically an African-American city — aligns with Berkeley, whose bourgeois white inhabitants are, as one character puts it, “liable to invest all their hope of heaven in the taste of an egg laid in the backyard by a heritage-breed chicken.” The novel is equally a tribute to the cinematic style of Quentin Tarantino, whose films its characters study and discuss, and whose preoccupations pepper its pages: kung fu, cinematic allusions and the blaxploitation films of the 1970s; and an interest in African-American characters and experience. Chabon and Tarantino make an unlikely duo; while the latter’s films tend toward gaudy eruptions of violence, Chabon bends Tarantino’s sensibility to a warmhearted novel about fatherhood in which the onstage violence consists of two graphic childbirth scenes and a 15-year-old boy whacking a chubby thug with a wooden sword. A self-help book in the style of Andrei Tarkovsky would be hardly more oxymoronic."

The President Plays It Safe,2012-09-07,article,News,,[],The Democratic convention concludes with a workmanlike nomination speech.,"The strongest impression left by Mitt Romney’s convention speech last week was that the Republican nominee’s campaign sees itself on pace for a narrow victory in November, with no risks or course corrections needed. The impression left by President Obama’s convention speech tonight was that incumbent’s campaign feels exactly the same way. This was a pure stay-the-course speech, workmanlike and occasionally somewhat distant, with a few inspired and moving passages standing out amid a litany of rhetorical moves that the president has made many times before. There was only the most general sketch of a second term agenda, only a relatively cursory defense of the president’s economic stewardship, and mostly assertions, rather than sustained arguments, to back up his claim that the country is headed (slowly) in the right direction. The strongest and most detailed portions of his remarks came on foreign policy (where his record is more popular and easier to defend) and in his late-in-the-speech attacks on the Republican ticket, which did effectively exploit some of the vulnerabilities that Romney’s rather content-free address created. And yes, maybe if Bill Clinton hadn’t covered so much of that territory so effectively last night, these strengths would have been enough to make the speech feel successful as a whole. But in the shadow of Clinton’s performance, the president often felt flat, rote, and unconvincing — almost as though he wasn’t quite convinced by his own arguments and promises, and felt a little awkward selling them to us."

The suspense novelist Tess Gerritsen — her latest Rizzoli and Isles mystery, “Last to Die,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 3 — told The New Zealand Herald last year that she had been reluctant for more than 20 novels to introduce elements of her Chinese-American heritage into her fiction.

Indecent Exposure,2012-09-07,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Privacy']",Garret Keizer considers privacy and the economic and class dimensions of its erosion.,"Privacy is a topic that tends to inspire discursive essays rather than philosophical treatises. In “A Bachelor’s Complaint,” in 1823, Charles Lamb deplored the exhibitionism of married couples who “perk up” their public displays of affection when in the company of single friends. In 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis lamented that American law, which protects privacy indirectly through laws safeguarding property, contains no remedies for the mental suffering that results from an offense against honor. Rather than attempting a comprehensive treatment of the subject, the privacy essayist identifies a distinctive value that privacy protects (ranging from dignity and autonomy to intimacy and friendship) and defends its value by using concrete examples and anecdotes from daily life."
Outback Outcasts,2012-09-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this historical novel, Kate Grenville explores modern Australia’s origins through the story of one family.","Kate Grenville’s latest novel, “Sarah Thornhill,” provides a wrenching conclusion to a tough-hearted trilogy about the colonizing of Australia. In her previous excursions into this rough, unforgiving land, shiploads of transported convicts, indentured servants and down-on-their-luck gentry were seen carving out English-style estates and tangling with aboriginals who somehow — to the newcomers’ astonishment — couldn’t accept the fact that they’d been conquered. By the time the heroine of this new book is born, in 1816, the country’s future is almost settled."

We believe that any nationality, no matter how small, has the inherent right to its own nationhood.” That was the core of the Atlantic Charter in 1941, which both Churchill and Roosevelt signed.

Long Divisions,2012-09-07,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Afghanistan War (2001- )']",Rajiv Chandrasekaran reports on America’s involvement in Afghanistan.,"Rajiv Chandrasekaran has done it again. Like “Imperial Life in the Emerald City,” his chronicle of Washington’s hapless management of the Iraq war in its early days, “Little America” is a beautifully written and deeply reported account of how a divided United States government and its dysfunctional bureaucracy have foiled American efforts abroad, this time to suppress the Taliban insurgency and bring stability to Afghanistan. It tells a story of political foibles, overly ambitious goals and feckless Afghans and Americans. The United States seems condemned to lurch between disastrous quick fixes and unrealistic visions of remaking countries overnight in its own image, never finding a middle road. No doubt most readers of this book will come away with the conclusion that our principal enemy in all this is ourselves."

They had been in Europe only a few months, thrown into combat and almost instantly captured during the Ardennes offensive, Hitler’s last big throw of the dice. The men now had “xylophone ribs” and “gangling arms.” Some of their fellow prisoners had been beaten to death by their guards for attempting to take sugar beets from fields. Blunden wrote: “They were more pitiful because they were only boys drafted from nice homes in a nice country knowing nothing about Europe, not tough like Australians, or shrewd like the French or irreducibly stubborn like the English. They just didn’t know what it was all about.”"
These Wild Solitudes,2012-09-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Paul Auster’s memoir includes an elegy for his mother, reflections on aging and an examination of the body’s frailties and desires.","Paul Auster was a novelist in Brooklyn before there were novelists in Brooklyn. (When I was growing up there in the 1980s, my father used to point him out to me as we did the grocery shopping in Park Slope — this was a rare kind of sighting.) Back in those days, his novels — the New York Trilogy, “Leviathan,” “Moon Palace” — seemed postmodern and fresh. They mingled the tropes of detective fiction with a kind of European quasi-philosophical ambiguity. “Kafka goes gumshoe,” as one of his editors described it. The novels comprised stories nested within stories; there were characters named Paul Auster, and there were doppelgängers even for the ­doppelgängers."
Murder in the Cathedral,2012-09-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"As chancellor, Thomas Becket was Henry II’s confidant; as archbishop, he became a bitter enemy.","“The biographer’s trap,” John Guy remarks in “Thomas Becket,” his portrait of that foremost friend turned foremost foe of Henry II, “is to look for a decisive moment of change.” But, he adds, “to do that is to write the history of the saint without his shadow.” With ­Becket, this temptation often seems to have been irresistible, from the very night of his murder, Dec. 29, 1170, near the high altar of Canterbury Cathedral. As a crowd swooped down on the battered corpse of the archbishop, tearing off pieces of clothing to dip in the gruesome puddle of his blood and brains, the outlines of the story of Becket’s sudden conversion from ­luxury-loving chancellor to ascetic defender of the church were already being rehearsed, soon to be followed by tales of his miraculous powers."

I ran across this quandary when helping my rising third grader fill out her “summer reading” list before going back to school. She wanted to include the books she’s listened to (I’d like to say it was to show her teacher what she enjoyed, but I know full well it was to make her list look longer), and I hesitated. Did a book listened to, I asked here last week, really count as a book “read?”"

Editor’s Letter,2012-09-07,article,Letter,,[],"Designers are trying to make fashion more responsive to the way men actually aspire to dress, i.e. to look on-trend but with offhand elegance.","This issue is about the fall men’s collections, so perhaps it is best to start with the news: this season, you’ll want a new coat, because there haven’t been so many terrific options in years, but you’ll come to wear it counterintuitively. An impeccably tailored number in the finest cashmere? Pair it for day with knits and slouchy trousers, as the artist Jeremy Everett does under the chic guidance of Bruce Pask. An oversize parka in waterproof nylon? Make like the director Michael Haneke and toss it over your red-carpet suit. If it all sounds a bit mad, consider it thus: in reversing the normal codes of dressing well (evening coat with evening look, casual jacket with casual wear), designers are trying to make fashion more responsive to the way men actually aspire to dress, i.e. to look on-trend but with offhand elegance."

Next, using a contoured blush brush (in place of the classic, dome-shaped powder brush), Kendal applied two shades of Nars Sheer Glow Powder Foundation — a lighter one on the outside of the face and a darker one across the cheeks — to perfect. (At press time, Kendal was not at liberty to disclose why, but a selection of models were given a more futuristic finish using Nars Light Reflecting Loose Setting Powder and Albatross Highlighting Blush on the high points of their cheeks, with some also sporting bleached or whited-out brows.) Eyes were contoured using Cayenne eyeshadow, while the same product in Blondie (light) or Bali (dark) were used to fill in the brows. Lashes were left bare.The Hair: “Ponytails are always very prevalent in New York,” says the stylist Guido Palau. “Half my career has been based on trying to reinvent it.” For Wang’s presentation, Palau used a variation on a look he’d originally conceived in the early ’90s: the taped center-part. To modernize the look, the stylist opted for dual texture — a sleek top with movement in the back — and low positioning. To achieve this, the top of the head (to behind the ears) was first dampened, then parted and treated with Redken Satinwear 02 Ultimate Blow-Dry Lotion before being blown straight. Once secured into a ponytail, the ends were sectioned and curled."

Krauss, a physicist, takes the view that all answerable questions are empirical; any philosophical question that turns out to be answerable, then, is in fact a disguised (frequently nascent) scientific one. Baggini contends that ethical questions are the great counterexample to Krauss’s reductive view. They cannot be settled by any simple appeal to empirical facts (concerning biology or evolutionary psychology, say); yet we do not consider them unanswerable or fit merely for idle philosophical debate. (One also wonders what Krauss would say about mathematical knowledge, which is, on most views, nonempirical.) Krauss, however, digs his heels in, arguing that ethical questions can indeed be settled empirically: “Ultimately, I think our understanding of neurobiology and evolutionary biology and psychology will reduce our understanding of morality to some well-defined biological constructs.”"

How Much Would Free College Cost for All New Yorkers?,2012-09-13,article,News,,"['Philanthropy', 'Scholarships and Fellowships', 'Tuition']",Less than you might think.,"In the magazine’s Education Issue, I write about the Kalamazoo Promise, a scholarship program that gives a full ride to all students who graduate from Kalamazoo public schools and go to college in Michigan. To replicate the program in New York City, to cover the college tuition of all 52,000 students who graduate from the nation’s largest school system every year, an endowment of something like $20 billion would be needed, according to Keith Luke, at the Connecticut-based Commonfund, which manages $25 billion in assets for nonprofit institutions. “Such an endowment,” he says, “would provide for annual tuition payments of $5,000 for each student for four years, growing annually at the rate of inflation for higher education.” Forbes magazine estimates that 57 billionaires live in the city. Mayor Bloomberg himself has donated more than $2.4 billion to favorite causes, and in 2013 Columbia University will finish a $5 billion fund-raising campaign, bringing in $1 billion more than its initial goal. So the money for a New York Promise is probably out there, but it would require one of the world’s biggest philanthropic efforts."

The Met often collaborates with major institutions like Juilliard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art but rarely with such a small fish. “It seemed like a good idea, as a way of educating the audience and reaching out to a new audience, to have performances down there,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said. Mr. Gelb said the first performance, on Oct. 26, would involve a few cast members of “The Tempest” and Mr. Adès as pianist performing scaled-down numbers from the opera. The concert will include works by Ives, Purcell, Stravinsky and Tippett, with other instrumentalists joining in, a spokesman later added. Mr. Muhly will play and program the second concert in May.

Who Made That Marshmallow?,2012-09-14,article,News,,['Candy'],The hard-labor makings of the fluffy treat.,"A century ago, confectioners made marshmallows from a froth of sugar, starch and gelatin, in a laborious process that involved lots of primping. Each candy had to “sweat” for several hours to form its delicate skin, and then it was sprinkled with starch. In the 1950s, Alex Doumak — an executive at the Doumak candy company — dreamed up an efficient solution to the problem of the slow marshmallow: he treated the candy goo as an industrial material. Machines forced the marshmallow slurry through tubes, subjected it to blasts of gas at 200 pounds per square inch, extruded it into long tails and then cut it into bite-size chunks. Doumak filled the candy with air, like a tire, trapping nothingness in an architecture of sugar. “Extrusion allowed for the marshmallow we’re used to today — with that springy, fluffy texture,” Sue Watson, manager of the company archives at Kraft Foods, says. Kraft began extruding its own marshmallows in the late 1950s, but its most creative touch might have been the space-age name it gave to the factory process — jet-puffed — as if the marshmallows had exploded out of a rocket-ship engine. As part of a 1959 promotion, children sent in empty Kraft marshmallow bags for a chance to own a 29-foot spaceship equipped with astronaut suits, countdown lights and an “astro projector for space observation.” The modern marshmallow may be mostly air, but it’s a sweet lesson in less is more."

The Third Musketeer,2012-09-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Before père and fils, there was the first Alexandre Dumas, a mixed-race general of the French Revolution.","In the 1790s, the son of an aristocratic white father and a black slave woman became a charismatic French general who for a time rivaled Napoleon himself, and afterward languished in an Italian dungeon. His story inspired the novel “The Count of Monte Cristo,” written by his son, Alexandre Dumas, who also drew upon his father’s adventures in “The Three Musketeers.” Posterity remembers this son as Dumas père, to distinguish him from Alexandre Dumas fils, also a writer, whose novel “La Dame aux Camélias” was the source for Verdi’s “La Traviata.” But the general was the first of the three Alexandres (he preferred to be known as Alex), and in “The Black Count,” Tom ­Reiss, the author of “The Orientalist,” has recovered this fascinating story with a richly imaginative biography."

But after reading William Souder’s engrossing new biography of Carson, “On a Farther Shore,” I returned to the book and discovered its central message to be — depressingly — timeless.

Vile Bodies,2012-09-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Grave robbers and serial killers populate this novel set in 19th-century England.,"“The Thing About Thugs” is an odd confection of a novel, set mostly in what looks like late-Victorian London. The streets are gaslit. The underworld teems with the flotsam of empire: lascars, Irishmen and so on, the undesirables of many nations. The city is overwhelmed with crime and prostitution and an influx of immigrants. Opium dens abound. And a serial killer is on the loose. Known as the “head cannibal,” he decapitates his victims after murdering them, but the heads are never found. The Metropolitan Police are baffled, as they were by Jack the Ripper, active in 1888, who also desecrated the bodies of his victims. Meanwhile, characters with names like One-Eyed Jack make shady deals in low taverns, and at the dinner tables of the upper classes Darwinian ideas are hotly debated. It feels as if we’re in the disillusioned twilight of the 19th century, but our narrator — or one of our narrators — sitting in his grandfather’s library “surrounded by Dickens and Collins,” claims that his story is set in 1837, the year Victoria ascended to the throne."

In a neat twist on Hitchcock’s “Rear Window,” Thomas Kilbride, who has been crazy about maps since he was 6 years old, is obsessively poring over Whirl360, a computer program rather like Google Street View, when he fixates on the image of someone being suffocated while standing at a window in an apartment building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

In the year 2012, breast-feeding still passes many good things from mother to baby: vitamins, minerals and “a solid hedge of extras to help ward off a lifetime of diseases.” But the practice also typically transfers “paint thinners, dry-cleaning fluids, wood preservatives, toilet deodorizers, cosmetic additives, gasoline by-products, rocket fuel, termite poisons, fungicides” and varieties of flame retardants, one of which, Penta-BDE, was banned by the European Union because of its chronic toxicity to humans."

In her first novel, “The Great Stink,” a thriller that takes place in the sewers of Victorian London, Clark wrote with such rich detail that you could almost smell the fetid air as you turned the pages. In “Savage Lands,” she transported readers to the young colony of Louisiana in the early 1700s, setting a complex love story against a fecund yet relentlessly cruel landscape that became as important to the plot as the characters themselves."

Night and Fog,2012-09-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Two shivery books for middle schoolers are set in Victorian England.,"What a literary legacy those Victorians left us! Not only are Charles Dickens, H. G. Wells and Charlotte Brontë still widely read, but they and their compatriots continue to inspire writers today: steampunk aficionados with their marvelous mechanisms; those who go for Gothic shivers; and the many others who set their narratives in 19th-century England. Among them are writers for young people who, in addition to creating great stories, engage an audience with little knowledge or interest in Victoriana. Two who rise to the challenge this fall are the debut author Stefan Bachmann, a teenager who is studying music at the Zurich Conservatory, and the Newbery Award winner (for “Good Masters! Sweet Ladies!”) Laura Amy Schlitz. "

The vowels are ethereal and consonants are anchors.” Many of his artworks strive for the appearance of self-generation, be it the aforementioned hand that looks as though it was whipped up in a tornado or a dodecahedron made of starfish cast in gold. Coffin is quick to point out that this complex five-sided shape is, according to Euclidean geometry, what Plato believed to be a building block of the cosmos, but then immediately offers another read where the starfish “could’ve come together the way skydivers do for fun in free fall.”"

The progression is both intriguing and relevant to those seeking to understand the Free Syrian Army, as the loosely organized antigovernment fighters are called.

It offers insights into something else — the social forces within an uprising that is reordering the Middle East."

The Inconvenient Truth Behind the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands,2012-09-19,article,News,,[],Guest blogger Han-yi Shaw argues that Japan in effect stole the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands from China in 1895 as booty of war.,"I’ve had a longstanding interest in the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, the subject of a dangerous territorial dispute  between Japan and China. The United States claims to be neutral but in effect is siding with Japan, and we could be drawn in if a war ever arose. Let me clear that I deplore the violence in the recent anti-Japan protests in China:  the violence is reprehensible and makes China look like an irrational bully. China’s government should rein in this volatile nationalism rather than feed it. This is a dispute that both sides should refer to the International Court of Justice, rather than allow to boil over in the streets. That said, when I look at the underlying question of who has the best claim, I’m sympathetic to China’s position. I don’t think it is 100 percent clear, partly because China seemed to acquiesce to Japanese sovereignty between 1945 and 1970, but on balance I find the evidence for Chinese sovereignty quite compelling. The most interesting evidence is emerging from old Japanese government documents and suggests that Japan in effect stole the islands from China in 1895 as booty of war. This article by Han-Yi Shaw, a scholar from Taiwan, explores those documents. I invite any Japanese scholars to make the contrary legal case. – Nicholas Kristof"

Regrettably, it is not a home run or a perfect game, but it isn’t a wild throw, an errant bunt or a dropped fly ball either. “Trouble With the Curve” is either an off-speed pitch that just catches the edge of the strike zone or a bloop single lofted into right field.

Had always been a papi chulo, so of course he dove right back into the grip of his old sucias, snuck them down into the basement whether my mother was home or not.” Breaking easily and often out of first-person narration to address his readers directly, Díaz flatters us with his confidences. Yet his prose also throws up walls, equally abruptly and equally seductively. Refusing to condescend or even pause for edification, the narrative moves along at speed, exciting us with its demands. This, then, is the Díaz rhythm: a syncopated stagger-step between opacity and transparency, exclusion and inclusion, defiance and desire."

When the Dust Settles,2012-09-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Claire Vaye Watkins’s stories show a concern for knowing the past and surviving the present.,"The most notable feature of “Battleborn,” the first story collection by Claire Vaye Watkins, is its physical landscape, especially as it affects the people who stake their claims on its inhospitable terrain. The reader is introduced to Reno’s founders, both the notorious and the anonymous; to figures who are insiders as well as outsiders; to personalities with historical pedigrees and to ones concocted to perfectly fit the crime. The point of view roams, but the Nevada setting provides a hard ground on which the reader counts for stability.

The postal code for the area is the NW of the title, and Caldwell — the housing project where the characters were raised — is the only fictional place on a very real map. The project consists of five tower blocks, each named for a giant of English philosophy: Smith, Hobbes, Bentham, Locke, Russell. Given the grimness of the locale, the names are only slightly less amusing than the titles of real tower blocks in Kilburn, which are named for Austen, Dickens and Fielding. There are times when the ironies of fiction cannot match those that reality provides."

Last Call,2012-09-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A “lost” novel by James M. Cain, the author of “The Postman Always Rings Twice” and “Double Indemnity.”","When you strike a match the flame burns blue closest to the source of combustion. For most of his prolific career James M. Cain had the blue flame burning in his explorations of greed, passion and murder. Novels like “Double Indemnity” and “The Postman Always Rings Twice” sizzled with it. And Hollywood always came calling. His work drew the best and brightest talents, and the results were classic. As recently as last year “Mildred Pierce” was produced for the second time in 60-plus years, in an Emmy-winning television run. Cain expertly mined the fine line between desire and lust and the consequences incurred by crossing it. And that skill is timeless, whether on the page or on-screen."

Making Sense,2012-09-21,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Music', 'Rock Music']","Though not strictly a memoir, David Byrne’s book about music explores his own personal and professional experiences.","David Byrne is a brilliantly original, eccentric rock star, and he has written a book to match his protean talents. It is not exactly a memoir — “the ‘aging rocker bio’ is a crowded shelf,” as he puts it in his acknowledgments. It is not exactly a series of essays about music, either, though it is some of that. It’s a little bit of both, proudly or unashamedly exposing Byrne’s biases and aimed at a particular audience: his own fans. Since he appeals to people generously diverse in age and interests, however, that’s a pretty big potential readership."
Where Is He Now?,2012-09-21,article,Review,,"['Travel and Vacations', 'Books and Literature']",The actor and travel writer Andrew McCarthy takes a deeply personal journey amid some of the world’s most far-flung places.,"Early on in “The Longest Way Home,” Andrew McCarthy recounts a vivid childhood memory of venturing alone into the yard one winter night. Intent on making a snow angel, he instead finds himself on his back mesmerized by the stars. It isn’t their beauty that transports him; it’s the unspeakable vastness of their glorious existence. In this moment, McCarthy is no longer a boy “prone to worry and fret,” but rather a wise young soul who knows to his very bones what it is to be alive, his entire being flooded with the exquisite perception that we are at once profoundly connected to the wide and cluttered world and utterly, inexorably alone in it. If I had to cut out the heart of this book, that’s where I’d put the knife, on that boy in the snow on that dark night long ago. It’s an intimate realization that glimmers with universality and sets us up for the question McCarthy grapples with mightily in the course of this engaging debut: How do we manage to nurture our deepest bonds at the same time that we honor our most necessary solitude?

In the movies the great sleuth has been portrayed by, among others, Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer, Nicol Williamson, Robert Stephens, John Neville, Jonathan Pryce, Peter Cushing, Ian Richardson, and, most recently, Robert Downey Jr., all of whom sensibly took the part in just one or two films.

The author Arthur Conan Doyle sometimes wearied of the character, and once even tried to kill him off, but the public wouldn’t allow Doyle to leave his hero forever at the bottom of the Reichenbach Falls.

The Wealth of Washington,2012-09-26,article,News,,[],Seeking explanations for D.C.’s influence-peddling arms race.,"In a post pivoting off my weekend column on Washington’s extraordinary recent growth, Dylan Matthews of Wonkblog marshals data showing that the soaring wage premium for Washingtonians doesn’t correlate directly with increases in the federal government’s share of G.D.P. The two have spiked together in the last few years, but the D.C. economy achieved separation from national trends in the Reagan and Clinton years and lift-off under George W. Bush, a long three decade period when government’s share of the national income was relatively flat. What does correlate, though, is the growth in Washingtonian wealth and the steady expansion of lobbying: As Matthews notes, “the growth in inflation-adjusted lobbying spending, as measured by OpenSecrets, tracks the D.C. wage premium’s rise since the 1990s quite well.”"

He set up an imposing agency to regulate air and water emissions, and another to regulate workers’ health and safety. Had Congress not stood in his way he would have gone much further. He tried to establish a guaranteed minimum income for all working families and, to top it off, proposed a national health plan that would have provided government insurance for low-income families, required employers to cover all their workers and set standards for private insurance. Thankfully for the country, his second term was cut short and his collectivist dreams were never realized."

And decorating books, he says, should change with them. Maloney and his partner, the architect Hermes Mallea, design houses and apartments for clients who collect Modiglianis and Roman sculpture, but for the first book on their work, the last thing they wanted was a standard coffee-table monograph, full of beautiful but static photographs and clichéd pronouncements like “Keep your silver polished.” And since the things in rooms, whether museum-quality or flea-market finds, are what fascinate Maloney and Mallea the most, the resulting book is called “Stuff: The M (Group) Interactive Guide to Collecting, Decorating With, and Learning About, Wonderful and Unusual Things” (Pointed Leaf Press, $65). While there are plenty of photographs of the firm’s work, they’re shown in the context of the book’s 40 collecting topics, each of which has its own “file folder” page. For example, the page for collecting maps, above, is followed by the photo, top, of a bedroom that is decorated with maps. And since Maloney felt strongly that the book had to have a digital component — “It was important that it look like 2012, not 2010,” he emphasizes — the topics pages have Digimarc watermarks. A free app can scan the topics pages and take readers to links on a wide and quirky range of resources — which, for maps, includes links not just to high-end dealers but also to a Web page on map tattoos."

Familiar Faces in Pop-Country Trio’s New York Debut,2012-09-27,article,Review,,['Music'],"Blue Sky Riders — a trio of the songwriters Kenny Loggins, Gary Burr and Georgia Middleman — are having their debut New York performances at Feinstein’s at Loews Regency.","Blue Sky Riders, a sturdy pop-country trio consisting of Kenny Loggins, Gary Burr and Georgia Middleman, is the latest illustration of a continuing phenomenon in which Nashville is the late-career catch basin for singers and songwriters from both coasts. It makes sense. There never was much stylistic difference between introspective New York folkies and laid-back Southern California dudes whose close harmonies in guitar-based arrangements were marginally less rural in sound and attitude than modern country music. Homogenization was the thing. "
"A Fighting Puritan, Wielding an Arsenal Against Infidels",2012-09-27,article,Review,,['Movies'],"James Purefoy plays the title character in “Solomon Kane,” based on the Robert E. Howard novel.","An Elizabethan English Puritan with mad sword skills named Solomon Kane sounds ludicrous, but his creator, the pulp writer Robert E. Howard (1906-36), excelled in outrageous fantasy. Best known for Conan the Barbarian, Howard described Solomon as “a strange blending of Puritan and Cavalier, with a touch of the ancient philosopher, and more than a touch of the pagan.” There isn’t much philosophizing in the 2009 British movie “Solomon Kane,” which, in between the smoting and smiting, introduces a character whose name — evoking at once King Solomon and Cain — telegraphs that this is one caped crusader who brings both piety and Old Testament-style wrath.

This 180 shift in perspective occurs early in the movie, which the Thai writer and director Pen-ek Ratanaruang adapted from a novel by his compatriot Win Lyovarin. It’s a contemporary if shopworn story of good and evil, decency versus corruption and one man fighting the machine when topsy-turvy and not. Mr. Pen-ek has said it’s also a political tale, if not transparently so for those unfamiliar with Thai history. For the uninitiated, the kick won’t be the story or its meanings but rather its silky fusion of pulp fiction material and art cinema style."

In What Universe Does This Guy Turn Into Bruce Willis?,2012-09-27,article,Review,,['Movies'],"In Rian Johnson’s “Looper,” a young hit man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) confronts his older self thanks to time travel.","“Looper,” an obstreperously entertaining, bullet- and attitude-ridden science-fiction pastiche, opens in a futuristic world that looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. Set in 2044, in a dystopia with Turner Classic Movies flavor, it puts a spin on the familiar figure of the existentially troubled gun for hire while leaving a layer of dust on many of the other genre fundamentals it plays with. Some of it you’ve seen and heard before, intentionally so, though it adds a weird wrinkle: an attempt to transform Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his nose prosthetically bobbed and a smirk surfing his thinned upper lip, into the wisecracking Bruce Willis of the “Moonlighting” years."

In the first place, the ambience onstage is disagreeable. Four dancers metronomically plod their way through long routines, occasionally counting out loud.

This festival was born in what is now invoked as a heroic era of local and global film culture — a feverish atmosphere perhaps best recalled by the writer Phillip Lopate in his 1998 book, “Totally Tenderly Tragically” — and its home at Lincoln Center frequently seems haunted by the ghosts of golden ages past.

Is it just too tempting to consider how a big social gathering might go disastrously wrong? Consider Ayelet Waldman’s “Red Hook Road,” in which a young couple meet a tragic end hours after taking their vows, or, in a more playful register, Ali Smith’s “There but for the,” which sends a dinner party spinning out of control when a guest locks himself in a room and refuses to leave. Lisa Zeidner’s funny, chaotic new novel, “Love Bomb,” is pitched in tone somewhere between Waldman’s and Smith’s: realistic in its depiction of sympathetic characters facing a crisis, while edgy in its satire of a well-off New Jersey suburb and its sometimes hapless police force."

Twelve years ago, when Chabon’s novel “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay” was starting to make some noise (it went on to win a Pulitzer in 2001), newspaper profiles mentioned that the author was wrapping up another project: a television pilot called “Telegraph Avenue,” about a black family and a white family in Oakland and Berkeley, Calif. How did Chabon get from there to here? “When I first considered the possibility of transforming the script into a novel,” he said via e-mail, “I went through the usual process, apparently requisite to my beginning any novel, of lying to myself about how easy it was going to be. I told myself I would just be able to ‘novelize’ it. Two and a half years later, battered and discouraged and ready to quit, and ready to kill the optimistic idiot who got me into this mess, I belatedly realized my mistake. A pilot is there to set the table. To set it beautifully, and with a proper and adequate complement of utensils for the coming meal. But in terms of nourishment it only really sets out some canapés, maybe a dish of olives. A novel has to serve a full, seven-course meal with sherbet in the middle and maybe a last little passed tray of petits fours. I had to start all over again, and reconceive the entire thing.”"
