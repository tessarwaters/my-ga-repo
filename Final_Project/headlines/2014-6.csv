(AMC) HALT AND CATCH FIRE Set in Texas during the 1980s tech boom, this new series stars Lee Pace (“Lincoln,” “Pushing Daisies”) as Joe McMillan, a former IBM salesman who enlists the help of a has-been computer engineer (Scoot McNairy, above left, with Mackenzie Davis and Mr. Pace) and a talented computer science student (Ms. Davis) to reverse-engineer an IBM PC. The story is fiction, but based on the actual technology race of that decade, in which companies were trying to create their own version of a PC. With AMC’s “Mad Men,” focusing on the ad executive Don Draper, ending next year, the network “seems to be looking for another period drama that can seduce viewers with old-fashioned customs and atavistic sins,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “Joe, like Don, is handsome, suave and moodily enigmatic, a salesman who pitches his product with passionate intensity.” Unfortunately, “Halt and Catch Fire” doesn’t seem to carry the same panache. “The period music is fun, but there is nothing particularly glamorous about high-tech Dallas. Most of all, the early 1980s are not a distant enough memory to cast a retro glow.” "

Another Ending for Arsenio Hall,2014-06-01,article,Brief,,['Television'],The February announcement that Arsenio Hall’s syndicated late-night show would return for a second season turned out to be both premature and mistaken.,"The February announcement that Arsenio Hall’s syndicated late-night show would return for a second season turned out to be both premature and mistaken. CBS Television Distribution, which owns the show with Tribune Media, has announced a cancellation because of a ratings decline among the viewers most advertisers pay for in late night, people between the ages of 18 and 49. (The ratings leader in that group is Jimmy Fallon on NBC.) Mr. Hall, left, who had a hit syndicated late-night show in the early 1990s, revived the franchise with some fanfare in September, and he scored some early impressive ratings. But the late-night scene had become intensely crowded, with as many as 10 shows fighting for a shrinking number of viewers. The ratings drop set in motion a pattern of downgrades from a host of local television stations, which began relegating Mr. Hall’s show to little-watched hours of the night. In February, his old friend Jay Leno appeared on the show with a letter confirming a second year. The ratings slide forced CBS’s syndication division to rescind that decision."

I’ve made the cookies using half whole-wheat flour and using all unbleached all-purpose flour, and I prefer the whole-wheat version – and not just because it’s healthier:The nutty flavor of the flour complements the nutty flavor of the seeds. You could soak the seeds, but you’ll have to take the time to dry them completely in a low oven; otherwise they will contribute too much moisture and the cookies won’t brown properly."

Feeling For | Modern Basics Dyed With Ancient Medicinal Plants,2014-06-04,article,News,,[],The sustainable clothing line Baserange debuts a capsule collection of blue pieces naturally colored with woad on Net-a-Porter today.,"Blandine de Verdelhan and Marie-Louise Mogensen, the France- and Denmark-based designers of Baserange, have made it their mission to produce minimal, functional clothing and underpinnings as sustainably as possible. The duo’s latest offering, debuting exclusively on Net-a-Porter today, is a capsule collection that highlights what de Verdelhan calls “a key part of the environmental footprint of making garments”: dye. The six-piece assortment gets its striking shade from woad, a medicinal plant in the broccoli family that the designers discovered in a workshop in a village near Toulouse, France. The ancient species was a key component of southern France’s economy during the Medieval and Renaissance eras; royalty and high society, including Napoleon, favored it for its distinctive blue hue. It’s also known for the anti-inflammatory and healing properties it provides when applied to the skin, and is unusual in the way that it continues to “live” as a garment ages. “The color grows stronger as you wash the material, and, if left in the closet, it will become irregular,” explains Verdelhan. “It’s such a beautiful, particular blue, and is quite important in Toulouse. There, all the shutters are painted in this color. It’s quite lovely.”"

He’s now swinging from the high wire with THOSE WHO WISH ME DEAD (Little, Brown, $26), a heart-thumping backwoods adventure that sends two creatively sadistic killers into Montana’s Beartooth Mountains, where they spark a monster forest fire to flush out the only witness to their crimes: Jace Wilson, a 14-year-old boy. Jace was just trying to escape his reputation as class coward when he dived into a quarry near his Indiana home. But when he swam into a dead man — and spotted the killers flinging a second victim into the water — Jace knew he was going to die. Reborn with a new name, he finds himself among the “bad kids” in a grueling wilderness survival course, parked there when his parents couldn’t be persuaded to put him in a traditional witness protection program. Jace’s hunters, the Blackwell brothers, are heartless sociopaths whose professional detachment is etched in their unnervingly precise grammar and careful diction. (“The way they say things. Like they’re alone in the world. Like it was built for the two of them and they’re lords over it.”) There will be no mercy from that quarter."

She fell in love with the city and so has never left, despite the fact that this place she adores hasn’t exactly opened its arms to welcome her. She found work as a language teacher, initially telling herself this is simply “a way to pay the rent.” But, as is often the way with the quotidian, “teaching became her real job and she forgot about other aspirations.” And yet those aspirations don’t quite disappear. In the fresh new days of spring, she determines to put together a book, “The Italian System,” about how to live a Roman life in New York. "

This welcome new recording from the impressive Boston Modern Orchestra Project offers three ingeniously written and distinctive Spratlan works. “A Summer’s Day” (2008) uses a simple, dreamy Celtic tune at the start as a jumping-off place for an elusive, complex suite that ruminates on the tensions below the surface of an inviting day. In his Concerto for Saxophone and Orchestra (2006), Mr. Spratlan finds a gripping, fresh approach to what might seem an awkward classical music genre; the music evolves from mystical musings to raw, jazzy vehemence. “Apollo and Daphne Variations” is like a Spratlan version of a Schumann suite, with alternating episodes of whimsy, frenzy and innocence.

Goudstikker’s daughter-in-law, Marei Von Saher, has been trying to reclaim the dyptich for years but has repeatedly run into legal stumbling blocks.  In a 2-to-1 decision, though, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a lower court’s decision and permitted Ms. Von Saher’s lawsuit to proceed.  The diptych was recovered and returned to the Netherlands after World War II, when the Dutch negotiated a partial settlement with Goudstikker’s widow, which did not cover the work. The Norton Simon bought the paintings in 1971 from a collector. In 2012, a district judge ruled against Ms. Von Saher, saying that the United States had fulfilled its obligations to restitute the art, and that any effort to alter the Dutch resolution of the case would interfere with the federal government’s sole authority over foreign policy. But the appeals panel noted that the United States had signed two international agreements — one in Washington in 1998, and another in Terezin, Czech Republic, in 2009 — intended to remove obstacles to the recovery of possessions stolen by the Nazis.  The Norton Simon released a statement saying it “remains confident that it holds complete and proper title” to the paintings and that it would “continue to pursue, consistent with its fiduciary duties, all appropriate legal options.”"

What’s On Saturday,2014-06-07,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) ENOUGH SAID (2013) Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in a Golden Globe-nominated role, plays Eva, a divorced massage therapist in Los Angeles who finds her life emptying out as her daughter (Tracey Fairaway) prepares to leave for Sarah Lawrence College. Then she meets Albert (James Gandolfini, above, with Ms. Louis-Dreyfus), another divorced parent of a college-bound girl, and although he isn’t her usual type, Eva suddenly finds herself falling for this funny, tender and sexy slob. Enter Marianne (Catherine Keener), a glamorous bohemian poet and Eva’s new client — who, Eva finds out a little too late, also happens to be Albert’s former wife. And so Eva listens to Marianne’s complaints about her ex — he’s a bore and a loser, clumsy in bed and unable to take care of himself — and surreptitiously tries to correct the faults in Albert that caused their marriage to disintegrate. “The real genius of ‘Enough Said’ is that it takes this entirely plausible anecdotal circumstance and unlocks both its farcical potential and its latent profundity,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this “small miracle of a movie” written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. “This movie will make you laugh and leave you in tears. Some of the pathos is the accidental byproduct of seeing Mr. Gandolfini, so playful and alive, in one of his final major movie roles and feeling once again the loss of his remarkable gift. There is also the pang of the empty nest, that mixture of grief and pride that is the special anguish of modern parents. But there is also something deeper. The ache that ‘Enough Said’ leaves behind comes from the blunt force of truth.” "

Even simple mastectomies, in which most nodes and the muscles were left intact, have become far less common. Dr. J. Dirk Iglehart, director of the Susan F.

Even Pollock’s relaxed, fluid brush strokes come into play in the L.A.-based designer’s laid-back silhouettes."

After Eric Cantor,2014-06-11,article,News,,"['Conservatism (US Politics)', 'Immigration and Emigration', 'Primaries and Caucuses', 'Shutdowns (Institutional)']",On the possible implications of a shocking primary defeat.,"During the government shutdown last year, I wrote a series of posts trying to explain why anyone interested in a healthy conservatism, a viable and serious Republican Party, should be somewhat ambivalent about the fight between the party’s insurgents and its congressional leadership. The insurgents pushed for the shutdown and the establishment resisted it, which meant that on the major question of the moment that establishment was right and the insurgents were not only wrong but utterly disconnected from reality. But in the bigger picture, the insurgents’ critique of the establishment’s lazy, K Street-oriented, “repeal the Medical device tax!” approach to policymaking was quite frequently correct, and it was noteworthy that some of the most prominent figures supporting the shutdown (Mike Lee, most notably, but also Marco Rubio and Rand Paul) were also sources of much of the party’s post-2012 policy innovation. So the post-shutdown scenario favored by many centrist observers in the media, in which John Boehner and Mitch McConnell just found a way to crush the grassroots and bring their base to heel, was not really a long-term solution to the G.O.P.’s lack of vision and seriousness. Instead — somehow, somewhere — the party would need to find leadership that could channel grassroots populism into a constructive agenda, without being captured by that populism’s follies and excesses."

Q. and A. | Wild Belle Spreads Its Island Vibes,2014-06-12,article,News,,['Music'],"The stylish sibling duo talk reggae influences, keeping it in the family and dressing like rock stars.","Reggae-based pop music has unlikely torchbearers in Elliot and Natalie Bergman, a.k.a. Wild Belle. The brother-sister duo grew up around Chicago, a city that’s more Buddy Guy than Bob Marley, and spent much of their childhood like modern-day Von Trapps, singing songs around the piano with their parents and two other siblings. Elliot, who plays keyboard and saxophone and, at 32, is seven years Natalie’s senior, would go on to study jazz and play in an Afrobeat band, Nomo, at the University of Michigan. And the siblings’ travels, both literal and sonic, helped expand their musical purview. The resulting mix of sounds — indie pop tinged with reggae and ’70s soul — can be heard throughout Wild Belle’s debut album, “Isles,” released last year. And though they insist the title is more about the album’s structure than its influences (“each song is its own island,” Natalie has said), it might just as easily be a nod to Chris Blackwell’s Island Records, whose catalogue of ska and reggae hits surely left an impression."

It also reminds readers that Neil himself (as he’s known on Twitter) once wrote a scrapbookish tribute of his own: His first published book — “written solely for the money,” he says — was “Duran Duran: The First Four Years of the Fab Five” (1984). “I got a phone call from a lady,” Gaiman explains in an interview cited in the book, “and she said would you like to write a rock ’n’ roll book for us? A rock ’n’ roll biography? And I thought, ‘Oh God, yes! I’m in!’ ” Gaiman suggested a handful of subjects, including the Velvet Underground, David Bowie and Elvis Costello, before the editor interrupted: “Do you want to write the Duran Duran book, the Barry Manilow book or the Def Leppard book?” Pragmatism led him to choose the relative newcomers Duran Duran. “With Barry Manilow,” he said, “I figured I was going to have to listen to, you know, 40 Barry Manilow albums.”"

Southern Living,2014-06-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The author of “Under the Tuscan Sun” reflects on her early life in a small Georgia town.,"Throughout Frances Mayes’s idylls about “the sweet life in Italy” — the subtitle of one of her best-selling memoirs — there are glimpses of a childhood, far less blissful, in the American South. In “Bella Tuscany,” she mentions her “tyrant” grandfather, Daddy Jack. In “Under the Tuscan Sun,” she touches on her “resigned disappointed ancestors” back home. Even as she enjoys a “pure surge of pleasure” while restoring Bramasole, a villa near Cortona, Italy, and discovering what it means to “surprise your own life,” she must keep the shadows cast by the town of Fitzgerald, Ga., at bay. “To put it mildly,” she remarks in passing of her father, Garbert, “he was a difficult man and to complicate that, he died at 47.”"
Nothing to Hide,2014-06-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Coming-of-age tales about girls and their fraught relationships.,"Paula Bomer writes the kind of women’s fiction that critics like to call “raw.” Her stark portrayals of biological womanhood have been described as raw and angry, raw and darkly funny, brutally raw and urgent. The word is meant literally, to a degree: Her earlier books, “Nine Months” and “Baby,” feature birth scenes that spare no anatomical detail. But “raw” has also come to mean something specific in blurb-speak about quasi-confessional writing by women, and it’s not always fitting or fair. Half praise, half dis, it commends the struggle to embrace female ugliness while finding the work unsatisfactory. “Raw” work is visceral but also hard to digest — a kind term, in other words, for something half-baked."
Late Bloomer,2014-06-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A married immigrant Londoner in his 70s is ready to come out.,"In 2012, at the age of 82, the indomitable stage and screen actor Christopher Plummer won his first Academy Award for his energetic portrayal of Hal Fields, a 75-year-old who comes out of the closet shortly after his wife’s death, in Mike Mills’s structurally complex romantic comedy “Beginners.” In the film, Hal’s full-throttled, last-call embrace of life inspires his son, Oliver, to fully embrace his own, while asking what exactly it takes to start life anew, and when, if ever, it’s too late."
European Pastoral,2014-06-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Michel Déon’s 1975 bildungsroman, a young Frenchman sets off to discover the Continent between the two world wars.","Michel Déon’s 1975 novel “The Foundling Boy” (in French “Le Jeune Homme Vert,” or “The Green Young Man”) is a bildungsroman, an account of a naïve young person’s education and the formation of his character, in this case inspired by Henry Fielding’s 18th-century novel “Tom Jones,” about a similarly clueless but likable character making his way on the road of life. As witty as its English forebear but with French savoir-faire, “The Foundling Boy” may win new readers for books translated from French, of which too few are published. English PEN and Arts Council England have supported Julian Evans’s translation, evidently in hopes of broadening our reading of these classics."

All in the Famiglia,2014-06-13,article,Review,,"['Organized Crime', 'Books and Literature']","A British historian examines the past of Italy’s three major regional crime organizations, and finds unity.","In “Blood Brotherhoods,” the British scholar John Dickie sets himself the wildly ambitious task of writing the histories of Italy’s three major criminal organizations from their origins in the mid-19th century to the present. The result is a book that is alternately impressive and infuriating. Dickie has amassed and digested an astonishing mass of material (tens of thousands of pages of trial documents, newspaper accounts and secondary literature) and followed scores of different characters (bandits, crime bosses, policemen, judges, politicians) in disparate places across a 150-year span. And yet he has managed, despite the girth and diversity, to sustain an argument and a story. He entertains the reader with dozens of fascinating figures — both noble and blood-chilling — while making frequently shrewd judgments that place this story in context, as a central feature of Italian life."

Struck by the models’ demure stances, she cut out certain images, before turning to her own fashion magazines and other periodicals. Last September, she asked Zosia Mamet to imitate the poses she had collected; the photographer Gus Powell shot. “Posturing” — inspired by the grids of the German artist Hans-Peter Feldmann, illustrated workouts and 1970s yoga manuals (hence the unitard) — is one of the many projects in “Women in Clothes,” out this fall. Edited by Sheila Heti, Heidi Julavits and Shapton, the book explores the issues women face when they get dressed. According to Shapton, the photo series evokes the energetic, experimental spirit of the publication, which features over 600 contributors. “We wanted the reader to do exercises,” Shapton said. “Exercises for the critical eye.”"

The Times believes opposition to the swap derives not from concerns for national security but for partisanship: “Perhaps Republicans were not troubled by such releases — and the more than 500 others that occurred during the Bush administration — because they were not then blinded by hatred of the White House occupant.”"

The Democrats United?,2014-06-18,article,News,,['United States Politics and Government'],Why party unity doesn’t necessarily protect presidential coalitions.,"Vox’s Matthew Yglesias, seconded by my colleague Paul Krugman, has written a seven-point response to my argument that the Democratic coalition is more fragile, and more dependent on Hillary Clinton’s unique strengths, than many people (mostly liberals) tend to think. Yglesias’s rebuttal focuses on the Democratic Party’s apparent lack of deep policy divisions, which he regards as the main reason why there’s so little opposition to Clinton at the moment. “It is impossible,” he writes, “to mount a coherent anti-Clinton campaign because there is no issue that divides the mass of Democrats.” There’s no equivalent of the intra-Democrat war over the Iraq War that gave us Dean v. Kerry and than Obama v. Clinton; the neoliberal/populist debate over Wall Street is muddled and complicated; there’s unanimity on the need to tackle inequality; the education reform debate is real but doesn’t matter enough at the federal level to shape presidential politics; and the party’s demographic diversity coexists with increasing ideological conformity. Then as his parting point, he notes that polarization and partisan rancor make it hard to imagine either political coalition truly dissolving any time soon: The collapses of the past, “where one party’s candidate gets utterly blown away … simply can’t happen under modern conditions.”"

Daring Deeds,2014-06-18,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Nick Bertozzi’s graphic novel “Shackleton” follows the explorer and his crew on his third attempt to reach the South Pole.,"In Nick Bertozzi’s graphic novel “Shackleton,” the great man who between 1901 and 1921 embarked on four attempts to reach the South Pole is first depicted in a moment of total failure.

But he is determined to return to the Antarctic, despite his wife’s entreaties (“The children are growing so quickly”!) and the claims of common sense. Though it’s easy to miss in Bertozzi’s telling, Shackleton went back about 5 years later, leading the Nimrod expedition, which came within 97 miles of reaching the South Pole. He managed to secure funding for a third attempt in August 1914, on the eve of the First World War. It is this famed adventure that is the focus of “Shackleton.”"

But that’s pure hindsight, and looking forward most of the strategic options being discussed look somewhat fantastical, from the invasion 2.0 favored by the editors of The Weekly Standard (in which “special operators, and perhaps regular U.S. military units” would rout ISIS, and then somehow re-join together what Maliki has very deliberately put asunder) to the ally-with-Tehran option advanced as the thinking internationalist’s alternative (which even its advocates acknowledge requires lending U.S. resources to the cause of a “strengthened expansionary Iran”), to the “targeted” air strikes reportedly being contemplated by the administration (which, as a certain general with some in-theater experience just pointed out, would risk turning the U.S. military into “the air force for Shia militias”)."

Down Under,2014-06-20,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Reefs']","A history of our desire to conquer, understand, embrace and ultimately save the Great Barrier Reef.","Our planet’s coral reefs offer nourishment and sanctuary to as many as nine million species, running the gamut of life, from single-cell organisms to whales. The Great Barrier Reef, shimmering beneath the turquoise shallows of Australia’s east coast, surpasses all other coral ecosystems in scale and fame. This colossal spine of life stretches for 1,400 miles, roughly the distance from Boston to Havana. Today the Great Barrier Reef seems obviously spectacular: a World Heritage Site visible to astronauts in outer space and acclaimed as one of the earth’s greatest natural wonders. Yet as Iain ­McCalman reveals in his enthralling book, “The Reef,” little more than 200 years ago no human had any inkling of its dimensions, far less any inkling of the complex science of its precarious vitality."

Late Reinforcements,2014-06-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Aharon Appelfeld’s novel, a sick and aging man in Jerusalem hires a young caretaker.","Of the many challenges confronting the contemporary writer of fiction, among the most vexing is the problem of goodness. How does one convincingly portray goodness in an age when the twin presiding deities are irony and violence, when the most feared transgression is the sin of sentimentality? Can there be a place for a character who seems genuinely selfless, motivated by benevolence, decency, the desire to be of help?"

Early Frost,2014-06-20,article,Review,,"['Poetry and Poets', 'Books and Literature']",The poet’s letters reveal a dedicated writer and ambitious man.,"In the early fall of 1912, a blandly handsome, tousle-headed American schoolteacher arrived in London. Nearing 40, coming without introduction or much of a plan — except, as he later confessed, “to write and be poor” — he was making a last attempt to write himself into poetry. It would have taken mad willfulness to drag his wife and four children out of their ­settled New Hampshire life in a quixotic assault on the London literary scene. Still, he was soon spending a candlelit evening with Yeats in the poet’s curtained rooms, having come to the attention of that “stormy petrel” Ezra Pound, who lauded him in reviews back home. Little more than two years later, the schoolteacher sailed back, having published his first two books, “A Boy’s Will” (1913) and “North of Boston” (1914). He had become Robert Frost."
The Wordy Shipmate,2014-06-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"From his fiction and cultural criticism to his latest adventure on an aircraft carrier, Geoff Dyer has defied genres for decades.","When Geoff Dyer came aboard the U.S.S. George H. W. Bush for his 14-day stay, he had his Ping-Pong paddle securely stowed but had misplaced his notebook. Too tall, spindly, self-described as “a leftover from a novel Graham Greene had decided not to write,” he had managed through a stubbornness born of sheer neurotic panic to wheedle his way, despite considerable and justified resistance from the United States Navy, into private quarters on the giant but very crowded vessel: the Vice-Presidential Room, no less. His report of his first day on board is a nonstop string of complaints: The noise is unbearable, he keeps knocking his head on the low ceilings and hatches, the spaghetti is cold and the lettuce inedible, the oil fumes are overwhelming, the temperature is like a blast furnace, the air is toxic, the ocean glitters but is spoiled by a sky greased with jet fuel. Dyer admits he is constitutionally incapable of adjusting to new environments; in fact, the only thing he’s grown accustomed to, over the years, is that he never gets used to things. This is the same man who, when asked by a friend (Alain de Botton) if he would like to spend some time writing in an interesting and relaxing environment, immediately replied: Put me on an American aircraft carrier.

These books describe the escapades of an 18th-century Scotsman and the World War II-era English nurse who fell into his world courtesy of a witches’ coven; writing in Salon in 1999, the critic Gavin McNett called it “the smartest historical sci-fi adventure-romance story ever written by a science Ph.D. with a background in scripting ‘Scrooge McDuck’ comics.” It’s been five years since the last Outlander title hit stores, and with a new Starz TV show based on the series coming in August, fans are primed for the latest installment. Gabaldon answered their questions recently on the website Goodreads. “People often say to me, ‘You write such strong female characters,’ ” she told one reader who praised the depiction of her heroine, “and I say, ‘Well, I don’t like stupid women.’ ” Gabaldon also cited her belief that fiction has three kinds of characters: mushrooms, hard nuts and onions. It’s a theory she’s expanded on at her official website. Onions, she explains, “develop slowly through the addition of multiple layers of personality, rather than popping up full-fledged as the ‘mushrooms’ do.” Hard nuts, meanwhile, play a merely functional role, making them difficult to animate. “Onions, mushrooms and nuts,” Gabaldon writes; “this is beginning to sound like an exotic recipe for turkey stuffing.”"

At the E.Tautz show in London, the designer Patrick Grant offered a version that was dark-washed, cuffed and slightly high waisted. (He sported a pair for his bow.) Worn monochromatically with a tucked shirt and long mac coat, the runway look was put-together but relaxed. Margaret Howell, who continues to show strong collections of covetable basics, also introduced a loose-fitting pair of jeans, which was topped with a simple shirt and coat. And Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida, the duo behind Marques’Almeida, took a more youthful approach, fraying the pants’ hems and pairing them with an equally frayed top and coat that evoked a similarly laid-back minimalism, but with an edge."

It is uttered by a doctor to a nurse after they have just assisted in a grueling home birth, an experience that is compared to the four-month battle in a muddy stretch of Picardy beginning on July 1, 1916, that was, at the time, the bloodiest episode of combat in human history, generating 60,000 casualties in a single day of fighting on the British side alone.

Report Calls for Tracking Data on Stress Disorder,2014-06-21,article,Brief,,"['Veterans', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'United States Defense and Military Forces']","The Department of Defense and the Veterans Affairs Department should track their efforts to treat post-traumatic stress more carefully, to see how effective those efforts are, a report released Friday said.","The Department of Defense and the Veterans Affairs Department should track their efforts to treat post-traumatic stress more carefully, to see how effective those efforts are, a government-sponsored report released Friday said. The report, from an expert panel assembled by the Institute of Medicine, noted that the agencies spend more than $3.3 billion annually on treatment of the disorder, which affects more than 500,000 veterans, including 8 percent of those who served in Iraq or Afghanistan — who are twice as likely to seek help as veterans of previous wars. It affirms the findings of a report published in 2012 that called for more careful tracking. The V.A. has tracked symptoms in some members given treatment, but it is not clear how many and whether those veterans are in fact improving, experts said. “Given that the D.O.D. and V.A. are responsible for serving millions of service members, families and veterans, we found it surprising that no PTSD outcome measures are used consistently to know if these treatments are working or not,” the chairman of the panel, Sandro Galea of Columbia University, said in a statement.

Should America Solve its Own Problems First?,2014-06-21,article,News,,[],Readers comment on my column about two 20-year-olds living worlds apart–and why we can address humanitarian problems both at home and abroad.,"Whenever I write about international issues, I always get pushback from readers who say that we should solve our own domestic problems before worrying about the rest of the world. As House Majority Leader Tom DeLay put it years ago, international humanitarianism puts “Ghana over Grandma.” I don’t buy that, and my Sunday column is a response to that way of thinking. But as my column notes, I think there’s sometimes also the opposite tendency, especially among university students–that is to think that it’s glamorous to fight illiteracy in Tanzania, but not to mentor at-risk students on the wrong side of the tracks in one’s own city.

The practice has been around for years, as a growing number of exchanges — there are now 11 public exchanges in the United States — have battled for business. What is new is the compelling evidence that the rebates are corrupting.” Brokers are technically supposed to find the best stock prices for their clients, but new research shows that they are “routinely sending orders to venues that paid the highest rebates.” The board calls on financial regulators to monitor executions, for the good of the American economy and maintaining fair competition: “Securities regulators clearly need to better enforce the best execution requirements on brokers, combined with better disclosure on brokers’ routing decisions and the rebates they earn. If Congress won’t provide more resources for enforcement, rebates need either to be passed along to the customer or eliminated altogether.”"

"Malaria Prevention, With Both Reward and Risk",2014-06-25,article,News,,"['ANTIBIOTICS', 'Malaria', 'Preventive Medicine']","Drug interventions in some African countries can help prevent the disease, but can also speed the spread of antibiotic resistance. To some, it’s worth the trade-off.","Alassane Dicko shivered and sweated through part of his childhood. Sick with frequent bouts of malaria, he often missed school. His older brother died of malaria, and so did his best friend. This disease can be cured with a pill, yet it claims about 1,700 lives each day — mainly children in sub-Saharan Africa who don’t take this medicine within a week of falling sick. Even when kids survive, some remain disabled or irrecoverably behind in school. That’s why Dicko, now a malaria researcher at the University of Bamako in Mali, took matters into his own hands when he became a father.Dicko gives malaria medicine to his children before they get the disease during the rainy season — the period when the mosquito-borne illness peaks in Mali. Tourists do something similar by taking malaria drugs prophylactically on trips to Africa, but for decades, health officials have said that Africans should not do so, because the widespread use of a drug eventually renders that drug ineffective. However, Dicko, who studies malaria prevention, has come to believe that the immediate health benefits are worth that risk.After a decade of clinical trials demonstrated that the preventive measure reduces malaria cases by 75 percent, medical authorities reversed their position against it, in areas where it’s most effective. They decided that the number of lives saved outweighs the cost of losing these drugs eventually. “For every drug you give, you will increase the risk of drug resistance,” Dicko says. “But these drugs are efficacious right now, so why don’t we use them and save thousands of lives?”"

Of particular interest is Jon Vickers in the title role. Here, Vickers is early in his career before it became clear that he would be the great dramatic tenor of his generation, bringing a powerhouse voice and expressive intensity to roles like Wagner’s Tristan and Verdi’s Otello. This is Vickers in a more youthful, lyric mode, but still singing with chilling power and ardency, despite occasional moments of strain in his high range. The cast boasts Gré Brouwenstijn as Elisabetta, Tito Gobbi as Rodrigo, Fedora Barbieri as Eboli, and Boris Christoff as Filippo II. The great Carlo Maria Giulini conducts a majestic account of the score. The performance comes through cleanly on this remastered recording. (Anthony Tommasini)"

It was a summer camp for consenting, distinctly un-Puritanical intellectuals. And the party needn’t be over.

Obama doesn’t like entrepreneurs!) and assuming that they’re already persuaded. It’s a speech rooted in conservative principle without being trapped by the conservative talking points, in other words, and that’s something we saw very little of in the 2012 campaign."

Troubled Inquisitor,2014-06-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A novel in dialogue between a man and a series of people he has kidnapped and chained up in a decommissioned military base.,"Political novels are full of pitfalls, particularly for a novelist with strong political leanings. Writers may craft their world however they like, so they need not deal with the complexities of reality if it inconveniences their narrative. Ayn Rand’s philosophy can work in “Atlas Shrugged,” for example, because it’s a fantasyland of her creation. A better approach can be found in “The Brothers Karamazov,” in which Dostoyevsky makes his ideological opponents his most articulate characters. Great writers force themselves to confront the challenges the world can throw against what they believe. The poet Tom Sleigh explains this as “the difference between exploring a political emotion, say, rather than a political conviction.” Whereas a political emotion is concerned with the lived experience of how politics impact people’s lives, a political conviction is primarily didactic — it “weaves no web, traps no chaotically buzzing flies — it’s hygienic, and easily put aside when the moment of outrage or conversational animus has passed.”"
Deep Cover: Alice Goffman’s ‘On the Run’,2014-06-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"For six years, Alice Goffman saw America’s penal system through the eyes of young black men in Philadelphia.","“On the Run” is, first and foremost, a remarkable feat of reporting. Its author, Alice Goffman, a young sociologist, had an ethnography assignment for an undergraduate class at the University of Pennsylvania, and she, the daughter of the renowned sociologist Erving Goffman (1922-82), didn’t take it lightly. She hung out with an older African-American food service worker at the university, and one thing led to another. Before long, she had moved into an apartment in a poor, largely black neighborhood in Philadelphia, her housemate a young man whose family lived down the block. Goffman became such a part of the fabric of the community that she was harassed by the police, witnessed someone getting pistol-whipped, was even set up on a blind date. And all the while she was furiously taking notes, trying to make sense of what at first glance appeared to be utter chaos going on around her. "

(“The Silkworm,” the second entry in the series, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 2, while its predecessor, “The Cuckoo’s Calling,” is No. 8 on the trade paperback list.) “When I ‘unmasked’ myself to my editor,” Rowling says on the official Robert Galbraith website, “one of the first things he said was ‘I never would have thought a woman wrote that.’ Apparently I had successfully channeled my inner bloke!” "

Seven years earlier, Jackie Robinson had signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers to break the sport’s color line, finally giving baseball the conditio sine qua non for any democratic claims it might make. Two years before that, American servicemen in Europe had celebrated Germany’s surrender by gleefully retrofitting the Nuremberg stadium into a ballpark, holding regular games where Hitler had recently rallied the Nazis."

The funeral will take place on Friday, the interment being in the mausoleum on the Archduke’s estate at Artstetten. Emperor Francis Joseph will not be present at this ceremony, but will attend a requiem mass on the following day. A representative of a Prague bank in which Archduke Francis Ferdinand’s will had been deposited has arrived in Vienna with the document.

What’s On Sunday,2014-06-29,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (HBO) THE LEFTOVERS Three years after 2 percent of the world’s population suddenly disappeared on Oct. 14, for no discernible reason — Was it an act of God? A natural phenomenon? — the residents of the fictional Mapleton, N.Y., are still searching for answers in this dystopian series created by Tom Perrotta, adapted from his novel, and Damon Lindelof, a mastermind behind ABC’s “Lost.” Churches have closed while cults have formed, including the Guilty Remnant, whose followers wear white, take a vow of silence and chain smoke. One member is Laurie (Amy Brenneman), the mother of Jill (Margaret Qualley), a high schooler, and Tom (Chris Zylka), who has joined another cult led by a man who claims that he can hug the pain out of people. Laurie is also the wife of Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux, the town’s chief of police, above, speaking with Amanda Warren), whose colleagues worry that he may be losing his mind as he tries to maintain order. The show “may never explain what happened to the people who disappeared, but the measure of its worth is that it may not have to,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “As with any good drama, the mystery lies in human nature more than in the supernatural. Once the show gets going, and it takes more than one episode to do so, ‘The Leftovers’ bores into the characters and the fissures that crack their community so astutely that the cause is almost secondary.”"
