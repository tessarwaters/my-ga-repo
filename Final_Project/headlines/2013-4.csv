La Famiglia,2013-04-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this novel, Italian-Americans balance their aspirations for the future and their nostalgia for Italy.","Early in Christopher Castellani’s new novel, “All This Talk of Love,” Frankie Grasso wonders whether he and his family are “at the end of something.” Frankie is a 30-ish graduate student in English literature, still a long way from the end of (for one thing) his dissertation. An answer begins to take shape when his sister, an affluent stay-at-home mom who has never strayed far from their childhood home in Delaware, organizes a family trip to Santa Cecilia, the village in Italy where their parents grew up. For all of the Grassos, the very idea of the trip stirs up thoughts of old losses, ghosts that shadow the present, prompted by the dissonant fact that like many if not most Italian-Americans, Antonio and Mad­dalena Grasso enshrined in their children a glowing image of things Italian yet never took them to Italy or even taught them the language. Feeling oneself “at the end of something,” this slyly ambitious novel suggests, may well be the existential condition of being Italian-American. "
The President Proposes . . .,2013-04-05,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', ""New Deal (1930's)"", 'United States Politics and Government']","Ira Katznelson examines how Franklin D. Roosevelt won approval for the New Deal, and at what cost.","Ira Katznelson heard his first political argument around the family table a few weeks before the presidential election of 1952. His grandmother started it, as only a grandmother can, by announcing that she wasn’t going to vote. Katz­nelson’s parents, who adored Adlai Stevenson, were suitably shocked. But Bubbeh Frima held her ground. “Since Roosevelt,” she insisted, “they are all pygmies.”"
Life Stages,2013-04-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Owen King’s hero grapples with his first film and his complicated relationship with his father, a B-movie Lothario.","“Double Feature” is a lame title for a novel that is epic, ambitious and dedicated to the uncontainable. Nor is the jacket of service; it shows a couple of old movie tickets when it needs a scrum of characters, not getting anywhere but being their talkative and irrepressible selves. I’d guess that this novel — Owen King’s first, after an esteemed story collection — was compiled over a period of years, possibly as a series of short stories about a group of characters. The novel is maybe a third too long, chiefly because as he wanders around King can hardly see a place, a face or a chair without embarking on a wordy, if not literary, description of it. This might have been cut by someone (why not King?) who can see that brevity is his best quality. But he may be a tricky man to edit or organize. He should persevere, for when he is good — and that is often enough to make a page turner of this book — he has a captivating energy, a precision and a fondness for people that are rare and that make the reader doubly impatient for him to do what he does best."
Book of Ruth,2013-04-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An abandoned daughter searches for her mother in Nancy Richler’s novel set in postwar Montreal.,"A family story: My mother’s friend Frika, a Viennese Jew, managed to leave Austria for America after the Anschluss. She knew if she were caught smuggling out the means of subsistence, she would be arrested. So she wore her money on her hat, in the form of a diamond brooch, which — thus flaunted — passed for fake. When the Nazis at the border asked what she was taking with her, she replied, “Only what you see!” And they let her through."

. . . Congress Disposes,2013-04-05,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Jews and Judaism', 'Presidents and Presidency (US)']","To fight World War II, Roosevelt needed support from legislators who wanted to keep out Europe’s Jews.","Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed the overwhelming support of American Jews during his presidency, and the reasons are clear. In his three-plus terms from 1933 to 1945, he led the war against Hitler, supported a Jewish homeland in Palestine, appointed a Jew to the Supreme Court, chose another to be his secretary of the Treasury and surrounded himself with Jewish advisers who helped shape the laws that revolutionized the role of government in American life — what some critics sneeringly called the “Jew Deal.” Then, of course, there was Eleanor Roosevelt, whose concern for minorities fused the bond even tighter. When Roose­velt died in 1945, the Rabbinical Assembly of America described him, almost supernaturally, as an “immortal leader of humanity and a peerless servant of God.”"
Up Front,2013-04-05,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Part of what made the discovery of gorillas so sensational in the Victorian era was that they were “too similar to humans for comfort.”,"In his review of Monte Reel’s “Between Man and Beast” this week, David Quammen notes that part of what made the discovery of gorillas so sensational in the Victorian era was that they were “too similar to humans for comfort.” As for whether attitudes have changed much, Quammen — the author of a biography of Charles Darwin, among other books — isn’t so sure; in an e-mail, he cited a recent Gallup poll that found 46 percent of Americans “decline to accept the reality that humans have evolved from ancestral primates.” His most recent book, “Spillover,” is about human diseases that come to us from animals, and he arrives at the terrifying conclusion that such outbreaks are likely to become more frequent and more worrisome. “The next big one might well prove devastating,” he said. Still, if there is one salubrious thing “about these insalubrious afflictions, such as Ebola and West Nile and AIDS and the influenzas,” it’s that “they remind us, by spilling over from nonhuman animals to humans, that we humans are just another animal.”"
Death of a Strongman,2013-04-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A new biography of Hugo Chávez can serve as a political obituary.,"On March 5, Hugo Chávez’s extraordinary good luck ran out at last. After decades of evading an endless string of opponents — from personal poverty to the United States government — Venezuela’s democratically elected strongman finally succumbed to the one enemy he couldn’t defeat. Even his ending was vintage Chávez. The perpetual showman spent the last months of his life ruling Venezuela Oz-like, by remote control from his sickbed (he even missed his own inauguration on Jan. 10). All of which makes this the perfect time for the release of Rory Carroll’s “Comandante: Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela,” a sort of political obituary for the self-declared savior of Venezuela — a charismatic champion of the poor who, during his 14 years in office, ground one of Latin America’s richest states into the dust."
Founding Father,2013-04-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Marie Arana’s biography assesses the man who led Latin America’s independence movement against Spanish rule.,"Simón Bolívar, the Liberator, was the George Washington of South America, or so he was regarded by sundry eminences in the United States during a large part of his extraordinary career. Grandeur was his nature. He aroused adulation. He dealt a few preliminary military defeats to the Spanish imperial army, and in 1813, he entered victoriously, for the moment, into Caracas on a chariot drawn by white-gowned daughters of the leading families, as if he were a god or a Caesar. And he assumed the magnificent title of “Liberator and Dictator.” The chariot and the daughters deviated, it is true, from the austere Washington style, and the dictatorial honorific has hovered a little ominously over his reputation ever since, as you can see by reading Marie Arana’s admiring and rueful biography, “Bolívar.”"

Why? Because, as Denise Kiernan explains in “The Girls of Atomic City” — new at No. 14 on the hardcover nonfiction list — that’s where the government set up the Manhattan Project’s top secret uranium enriching facilities, staffed almost entirely by young women who didn’t learn what they were working on until the first bomb fell on Hiroshima."
Ghosts of Budapest,2013-04-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Tamas Dobozy’s stories unfold between war-torn Hungary and the émigré circles of present-day North America.,"Are you experiencing any of the following: (1) A thirst for ­palinka? (2) A yearning for Budapest, though the closest you’ve ever come is the Hungarian Pastry Shop in Manhattan? (3) An urge to deploy diacritical marks over every other vowel? If so, you may be suffering from Hungarophilia. My own case dates to my mid-20s, when I discovered Peter Nadas’s novel “A Book of Memories.” Its high-Modernist aspirations were just one of the ways this contemporary masterpiece seemed to issue from a more distinguished past. Fascinated, I began reading every living Hungarian novelist I could find in English: Imre Kertesz, Laszlo Krasznahorkai. . . . By the time I got to Peter Esterhazy’s “Celestial Harmonies,” I, too, was dreaming of “palaces with swirling towers and flapping banners gazing at their reflections in the mirror of the lake.”"
The Messenger and the Message,2013-04-05,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Muslims and Islam']",This book presents the life of Muhammad for Western readers.,"In today’s febrile cultural and religious climate, what project could be more fraught than writing a biography of Muhammad? The worldwide protests at “The Innocence of Muslims,” 14 minutes of trashy provocation posted on YouTube, are a terrible reminder to the would-be biographer that the life story of the prophet of Islam is not material about which one is free to have a “take.” Lesley Hazleton’s “First Muslim” is a book written by a white woman of dual American and British citizenship, published in America more than a decade after the 9/11 attacks. For many believers it is already — even before it is read, if it is read at all — an object of suspicion, something to be defended against, in case it should turn out to be yet another insult, another cruel parody of a story such an author has no business telling."

It strikes Brunetti as sad, as well as sinister, that he’s unable to find any public record of Davide, that his mother can’t produce her son’s birth or baptismal certificates, school documents or any other verification of his life. In the eyes of the state, Davide never existed. “It daunted Brunetti, the pathos of it.”"

Extraordinary trees — rare, oddly shaped or just plain huge — provide something else altogether. They can serve as sculptural centerpieces to a yard or perfectly complement architectural details. Most tree nurseries keep some odd ducks in their inventory, but a few, including the three listed below, specialize in unusual specimens they either grow themselves or purchase during regular scouting missions of public and private land. As a general rule, the more unusual the tree, the higher the price. But as Todd Forrest of the New York Botanical Garden says: “Planting a tree transforms the landscape.

Vain Glorious | Olfactive Studio,2013-04-05,article,News,,"['Perfumes and Fragrances', 'Photography']",Experience the connection between visual elements and scents with Olfactive Studio’s new collection of fragrances.,"“Images and perfumes have always been linked,” says Céline Verleure, a 20-year fragrance industry veteran based in Paris. “When we smell a perfume, it gives us images in our heads, like a landscape or a scene.” A few years ago, she decided to explore this relationship further by asking perfumers to collaborate with photographers on a series of eau de parfums inspired by the visual artists’ works. Thus, Olfactive Studio was born, and the French brand’s five highly concentrated unisex scents arrive in the United States on April 8. “The perfumers are able to create on a spiritual level. Olivier Cresp, who worked on the Flash Back fragrance with the photographer Laurent Segretier, says there’s a new and special freedom in starting with the visual,” Verleure notes. Her current favorite in the lineup is Lumière Blanche, a milky yet fresh and spicy concoction from the perfumer Sidonie Lancesseur, who drew her inspiration from the famed photographer Massimo Vitali’s picture of sunbathers gathered on the ivory-hued Scala dei Turchi cliff in southern Sicily. To fully experience the connection between the visual and olfactory elements, Verleure suggests first choosing a scent based on the image, which adorns the fragrance box, and then smelling the juice second. “Pick the photo that gives you the most emotion, and you will really like that perfume. It works!” she says."

Paradigm Shift | Tools for Life,2013-04-05,article,News,,['Interior Design and Furnishings'],A furniture collection designed for Knoll by OMA that blurs the lines between working and living space makes its debut.,"After its sneak preview in January at the fall 2013 Prada men’s fashion shows, “Tools for Life,” the furniture collection designed for Knoll by OMA, the architecture office that was co-founded by Rem Koolhaas, will make its official debut next week during the Salone Internazionale del Mobile in Milan.

A massive, heavily engineered piece called the 04 Counter consists of three horizontal bars that stack like a wall, but which can also pivot and cantilever, transforming the piece from room divider to “piazza,” as Benjamin Pardo, Knoll’s design director, called it, adding, “Once people discover that the object moves, they want to engage with it.”"

(Cinemax) DARK SHADOWS (2012) Johnny Depp, above, summons the spirit of the romantic vampire hero Barnabas Collins in Tim Burton’s revisiting of a 1960s daytime soap opera.

A Catalog Will Detail Hirst’s Spot Paintings,2013-04-07,article,Brief,,['Art'],The publisher Other Criteria will issue a comprehensive catalog of the paintings this spring.,"Damien Hirst’s whimsical work evokes amusement, fascination and annoyance among art lovers, seemingly in equal measure. His spot paintings, which he began in 1986, have particularly been lightning rods. These panels of bright-hued spots are usually arranged in columns on canvases of different shapes, and his fans have paid as much as $3.4 million for them. Last year the Gagosian Gallery mounted an exhibition, “The Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011,” at 11 galleries in eight cities. But the show’s expansive title notwithstanding, it presented only 331 works — a fraction of the spot-painting output of Mr. Hirst. The full scope of Mr. Hirst’s fascination with colored dots will become clear this spring, when his publisher, Other Criteria, issues a comprehensive catalog of the paintings: a 1,000-page illustrated book listing every work. Jason Beard, the director of Other Criteria, told The Art Newspaper that there are about 1,400 of the works. Mr. Hirst painted the first 25 himself; the others have been mainly entrusted to his assistants.

The Havana Times reported that the couple also visited a dance troupe, Danza Contemporánea de Cuba, the singer Haila Mompié and the children’s theater group La Colmenita, and met with students and teachers at the Superior Art Institute. They may soon be explaining the trip to members of Congress, or facing a prison sentence and a fine. Treasury Department regulations prohibit Americans from traveling to Cuba “unless authorized by a general or specific license.” Now two Republican members of the House of Representatives from Florida — which has a large population of Cuban refugees and where feelings about Cuba are acute — have raised questions about the visit. The representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, have written to Adam J. Szubin, the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department, asking about the nature of the license the couple received for their visit. “Cuba’s tourism industry is wholly state-controlled,” Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Diaz-Balart wrote, “therefore, U.S. dollars spent on Cuban tourism directly fund the machinery of oppression that brutally represses the Cuban people.” Penalties for violating the travel ban can include a 10-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.

She articulated a peace-through-strength line on nuclear and conventional arms control, disclosing along the way facts that Soviet viewers had never read or heard in their media about their own arsenals. (A transcript is here.) She heaped praise on Gorbachev but, at a time when Gorbachev and President Reagan were indulging in talk about a world without nuclear weapons, Thatcher explained to viewers the European view that only nuclear deterrence had sustained 40 years of peace.

Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s Post-Scandal Playbook,2013-04-10,article,News,,[],Taking the plunge back into public life after a marital (and political) catastrophe.,"One day in early February, I met Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin for breakfast at the Gramercy Park Hotel, one of their regular joints, just a few blocks from their apartment on Park Avenue South.

This is what happens after a scandal: Ranks are closed and the world shrinks to a tiny dot. It is a life in retreat.

Instead of ink, each stamp has a unique dot pattern that triggers an artistic effect when placed against the iPad’s screen. Want to add a swimming dolphin? Use the sticker stamp. Want to make your dolphin move? Use the Arrow stamp, and trace a course. After you snap your iPad into the holder and download the free app, called ArtSee Studio, your child is free to sketch. One weak point — our testers found it hard to “undo” a sticker once it has been placed. But they were impressed by the powerful drawing options, which include such wonders as a rainbow crayon. Saving projects is automatic, and there is a set of games like connect the dots and concentration.  The case fits all generations of iPads.Download the app here."

He sensed secrets in his childhood home. His mother told him his father had died of a heart attack. “I had to pry this out of her,” Hainey writes in “After Visiting Friends.” She was vague about the circumstances. “All my life,” he says, “I’ve felt the story I was told about how my father died did not add up.” An obituary mentioned that his father had been visiting friends: who?

What’s On Friday,2013-04-12,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Sundance) ADAPTATION (2002) The director Spike Jonze and the writer Charlie Kaufman (along with his imaginary twin, Donald, who is also credited with writing the screenplay) journey into metafiction in this movie about the two Kaufmans (Nicolas Cage, in both roles) and Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep), a writer for The New Yorker whose book “The Orchid Thief” inspired the film. Chris Cooper won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his role as an orchid obsessive; Ms. Streep and Mr. Cage (above) also received Oscar nominations. “ ‘Adaptation’ is, most obviously, a movie about itself, as gleefully self-referential an exercise in auto-deconstruction as you could wish,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But it is also, more deeply, a movie about its own nonexistence — a narrative that confronts both the impossibility and the desperate necessity of storytelling, and that short-circuits our expectations of coherence, plausibility and fidelity to lived reality even as it satisfies them. Common sense suggests that there could never be such a movie, but if there could, it would have to be one of the slipperiest, most fascinating and, by any sane reckoning, best movies of the year.”"

Development and Its Discontent,2013-04-12,article,News,,"['Bridges and Tunnels', 'Roads and Traffic', 'Traffic Accidents and Safety']",Street traffic is exploding in Cambodia. And no one can keep up.,"PHNOM PENH — In 2010, the Cambodian government unveiled with great fanfare the country’s first traffic overpass. The $6 million project — lit with a futuristic blue neon swoosh — was intended to ease congestion where a major boulevard that runs north-south through Phnom Penh intersects with twin bridges that cross the Bassac River, just to the east. Prime Minister Hun Sen called the Sky Bridge Project a “great achievement” and proclaimed that it would end traffic problems in the area.It wasn’t long before commuters discovered a catch: By making it easier for motorists traveling north-south to keep going straight, the new overpass made it impossible for them to turn left onto the intersecting east-west road. The result is a mess. Now, drivers heading south who want to cross the river must first take a right and drive away for several hundred meters and then make a U-turn and head back. And motorists heading north are forced to turn right, which necessarily takes them onto the bridges — meaning that they are forced to cross the river, turn around and cross the river again. Congestion in the area is worse than ever, and the traffic more dangerous."

Day, who finished tied for second at the 2011 Masters, had never topped the leader board overnight at a major. Day is one shot ahead of his countryman Marc Leishman and the American veteran Fred Couples, who are tied for second at five under. Angel Cabrera, Jim Furyk, and Brandt Snedeker are tied for fourth at four under.  Tiger Woods, who had his back nine derailed by a severe bounce off the flag pole on No. 15, is part of a seven-way tie for seventh. As the day wrapped up, most eyes were on the middle-to-bottom part of the scoreboard, as the cut line hovered around the name of 14-year-old Guan Tianlang of China, who just barely survived with a score of four over.   Guan would have advanced more comfortably had he not been assessed a rare stroke penalty for slow play on the 17th hole.  Despite the unusual ruling, Guan did not take opportunities offered to him by Tom Rinaldi of ESPN to criticize or bemoan the controversial ruling.  “I respect their decision,” he said. "

Who Made That Lipstick?,2013-04-12,article,News,,"['Cosmetics and Toiletries', 'Inventions and Patents']",Creating a kiss-proof formula.,"In the 1940s, lipstick tended to fade and smear. Women were constantly checking their teeth for red marks and repainting their mouths. Hazel Bishop — a biochemist with a background in petroleum science — set out to solve this problem. Using the tiny kitchen of her Central Park West apartment as a lab, she cooked potions in a double boiler and compounded dyes on a countertop. Sometimes so much dust escaped from her experiments that the butter in her refrigerator turned red. Lipstick had existed for centuries, of course, but Bishop hoped to create a long-lasting version for the modern woman, one that would stand up to the friction of coffee cups, cigarettes and kisses. She hit on a formula made with lanolin and dyes that penetrated deep into the skin. To demonstrate its sticking power, she persuaded her neighborhood druggist to decorate his hand with streaks of her lipstick. As he rang up purchases, the red stripes stayed bright."

This week, Volume 5 of “American Vampire,” about a new breed of bloodsucker, enters the list at No. 2. (He is also the writer behind the Batman stories at No. 1 and No. 8.) In this latest installment of “American Vampire,” Mr. Snyder has been blessed with two gifted collaborators: Rafael Albuquerque, the original series artist, and Dustin Nguyen, who illustrates a spin-off story included in this collection. Though vampires have seemingly given up their number one status in pop culture to zombies, Mr. Snyder proves there are still plenty of tales to tell about these creatures of the night. Mr. Nguyen lends his wonderfully expressive and moody art to an adventure involving the hunt for the granddaddy of all vampires, Dracula, while Mr. Albuquerque illustrates the exploration of all things related to Skinner Sweet, the first American vampire, who is more vicious and less bothered by sunlight. The only drawback to reading this book in collected form is that the reader does not get to long savor the cliffhangers with which Mr. Snyder ends most issues.

What’s On Tuesday,2013-04-16,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M.

They argue that the convictions, and the years the defendants served for the attack, of which they were eventually absolved last year, constituted a second, racially motivated crime. “Equal measures criminal investigation, cultural exhumation and a consideration of race in a presumptively postracial America, it seeks to set the record straight,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Measured in tone and outraged in its argument, it is an emotionally stirring, at times crushingly depressing cinematic call to witness. It’s also frustrating because while it re-examines the assault on the jogger and painstakingly walks you through what happened to the teenagers — from their arrest through their absolution — it fails to add anything substantively new. If you followed the news, the story will be familiar; if you lived in New York in 1989, it may also feel incomplete.”"

The suit, which was filed Tuesday in conjunction with three local affiliates of the National Education Association in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Gainesville, says Florida’s two-year-old evaluation system violates teachers’ rights of due process and equal protection. Under a 2011 law, schools and districts must evaluate teachers in part based on how much their students learn, as measured by standardized tests. But since Florida, like most states, administers only math and reading tests and only in selected grades, many teachers do not teach tested subjects. One of the plaintiffs, a first-grade teacher, was rated on the basis of test scores of students in a different school in her district, and another, who teaches vocational classes to aspiring health care workers, was rated based on test scores of students in grades and subjects she had never taught. “This lawsuit highlights the absurdity of the current evaluation system,” said Andy Ford, president of the Florida Education Association.

Vain Glorious | Aqua Spin Classes,2013-04-17,article,News,,['Exercise'],"A fitness fad that’s swept over France, has just landed stateside.","Aqua spinning, the fitness fad that’s swept over France, has just landed stateside with the newly opened Aqua Studio in TriBeCa. As the name implies, there are elements taken from traditional spinning — fat-blasting and calorie-burning moves, upbeat soundtracks, and friendly (but firm) instructors — but there are also benefits that only exercising in water can boast. For starters, there’s the draw of a low-impact, high-resistance workout. The water supports your body weight and reduces stress on joints while generating resistance, which encourages your legs to move in a safe and controlled manner. Devotees also claim that aqua spinning can help smooth dimpled thighs. Aqua Studio’s founder Esther Gauthier, a French expat, says, “Moving in water generates a natural massage that drains the lymphatic system and improves the appearance of cellulite.” But most important, being in the water is simply fun. There’s something about throwing on a bathing suit and splashing in water that takes the typical emotional edge off of exercising: your muscles are getting a serious workout, while your mind feels buoyant and light. After my first session, I felt rejuvenated and energized, not wiped out (like I do after an intense run), and left the studio with a spring in my step. Sorry, guys: for the moment, Aqua Studio is for the ladies only."

And yet his quest to be exceptional (in which he inarguably succeeded) didn’t appear to make him all that happy, judging from his prodigious, grumbling output.

Vindication,2013-04-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"The life of a 19th-century public intellectual, writer and feminist.","Margaret Fuller died on July 19, 1850, in a shipwreck off Fire Island. In her intellectual prime and at the height of her influence as a social reformer, she was returning home from Europe with her Italian husband and their child. A major advocate for the rights of women, Fuller had left the United States in 1846, just a year after the publication of her influential book, “Woman in the Nineteenth Century,” which both Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton cited as an inspiration. Having accomplished her mission, as Megan Marshall puts it in this new biography, “to meet the writers and radicals whose work she’d admired from afar and test their minds in conversation,” Fuller was coming home to the United States, having flagrantly acted out the freedoms she demanded as every woman’s right."
The Lost Novelist,2013-04-19,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",Blake Bailey traces the rise and fall of Charles Jackson.,"Charles Jackson, one of the most successful failures in American letters, wished as fiercely as any writer for literary immortality. This he was denied, though for a brief moment in the mid-1940s it seemed all but certain. His first novel, “The Lost Weekend,” sold nearly half a million copies within five years of its publication, was translated into 14 languages, inspired a hit film that swept the 1945 Academy Awards, and helped cause a major shift in public perceptions about alcoholism. After this taste of fame, Jackson’s career tumbled into a long decline, made more agonizing by periodic relapses of hope. Even before he died, in 1968, his reputation had blurred into obscurity. Today, except for vague memories of his connection to the classic movie, it has all but disappeared."
"This Could Be ‘Heaven,’ or This Could Be ‘Hell’",2013-04-19,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets', 'Translation']",Clive James takes on a verse translation of Dante’s “Divine Comedy.”,"The perfect translation of Dante’s “Divine Comedy” remains one of literature’s holiest grails. Some translators have captured facets of the poem’s magic, but always at a cost: Charles Singleton conveys Dante’s erudition but flattens his poetry; John Ciardi recreates his music but takes mammoth liberties with the original; and John Sinclair’s “thees” and “thous” date his otherwise deft rendering. If the translator’s task is “to liberate the language imprisoned in a work,” as Walter Benjamin writes, then few literary strongholds come as heavily fortified as “The Divine Comedy.” Written in Dante’s native Tuscan instead of the more prestigious Latin, the poem and its earthy idiom, copious allusions and otherworldy precision burden translators, especially in rhyme-poor English, which struggles to match the momentum of Dante’s terza rima and internal rhymes. No wonder that Dante’s latest translator, the eminent Australian poet and critic Clive James, feared his task would be “thankless.”"

The Last Gasp of the East Village,2013-04-19,article,News,,"['Bars and Nightclubs', 'Nineteen Hundred Nineties']",A bloody valentine to the riotous ’90s in New York.,"The ’90s was not a golden era in New York City, by almost anybody’s reckoning. It had neither the nothing-left-to-lose freedom of the ’70s nor the everything-to-gain hedonism of the aughts. History will record it as a neutered, amorphous interregnum. But I can attest to the fact that the East Village was a good place to live then, filled with coffee shops, secondhand stores, Kim’s Video and lots of seedy bars. It still felt like downtown, and for a kid raised in the suburb known as the Upper East Side, there was nothing more I wanted from a neighborhood. One of my favorite places was a rock club called Brownies, on Avenue A, and that was largely because of a single night in 1996 that kind of represents the whole decade for me."

Beautiful and Damned,2013-04-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This new novel is based on the lives of Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald.,"They were, arguably, the first celebrity couple of the modern age, Jazz-era avatars running wild in a new century. She was a precocious, spoiled Southern belle and bad girl; he was a Midwesterner and Princeton dropout who had turned his experience into the novel “This Side of Paradise.” In the 1920s, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald careered through New York City and Great Neck, Paris and the South of France, leaving in their wake a trail of splintered Champagne glasses and glittering bons mots. Their tragic, slow-motion falls — she to madness and a series of mental institutions, he to alcohol and an indifferent public — seemed inevitable, and drawn from the pages of one of his novels. She was reckless to the point of oddity; he always drank like a professional, collapsing the arc from charming to churlish early on."

Other Labyrinths,2013-04-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Anne Carson returns to the Greek myth she first explored in “Autobiography of Red.”,"Anne Carson has a history of doing unpredictable and genre-crossing things. A classical scholar who came late to poetry, she rose, in the ’90s and ’00s, quickly and deservedly, to prominence. Many readers (including me) first knew her through “The Glass Essay,” a 38-page multipart lyric narrative in 1995’s “Glass, Irony and God.” The poem is an inspired mash-up: a confessional-style “I” recounts a breakup with a lover and a visit to an aged mother while considering the life and writings of Emily Brontë and reporting on her surrealist visions of nudes. The yoking of disparates, the old and the new, continues to be a Carson strategy. She’s generally claimed by the poetry world, but her books often contain swaths of lyric, critical or essayistic prose, as well as translation, dramatic dialogue and visual art. Many toil in the interstices of genre; Carson’s palatable, popular, sophisticated and who-cares approach may have done the most and best work in the last two decades to stop people worrying so much about what’s poetry and what’s not. At her best, she’s among our most exciting poets. At her less-than-best she’s reliably ingenious, full of charisma and surprise. Lesser poets who behave more predictably and risk less are easier to praise — and not as important."

I hired a fishing boat to take me to a near-deserted island in the Gulf of Thailand and trekked for weeks through roadless villages in the Nepalese Himalayas. The highlight of the trip was a one-week tour of Myanmar, then almost completely cut off from the outside world. Three decades later, Jet Skiers and beach resorts have taken over my Thai island, and busloads of day-trippers flock to those Nepalese villages on a newly built trans-Himalayan highway.

What it does not feature, significantly, is any of the following: “Laundry hanging on a line. A little girl in a field of wildflowers. A pair of shoes on a beach. An empty swing on the porch of an old yellow house.” If that list sounds familiar, it’s because it appeared in the Book Review last year in Wolitzer’s essay “The Second Shelf,” about gender bias in publishing and the hurdles (including jacket art) facing any woman who hopes to be taken seriously as a literary novelist. Interviewing Wolitzer at Slate recently, her editor at Riverhead Books, Sarah McGrath, acknowledged treading carefully as a result: “We approached the art for this book with particular sensitivity,” she said, “and the art department was given a copy of your essay along with the manuscript.

What I thought of almost immediately was an article that Elizabeth Rubin wrote for this magazine back in the summer of 2001, which I was lucky enough to edit. “Only You Can Save Your Sons” is an extraordinary feat of reporting and writing, as powerful and haunting as any magazine article I’ve ever read. It turned out that other editors here at the magazine were thinking about Elizabeth’s story, too, and as the discussion on Twitter and elsewhere throughout the day turned to questions of whether the Tsarnaev brothers were influenced by the Chechen war — and as the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, announced that the root of the Tsarnaev’s “evil” lay in America and not in Chechnya — it seemed like a good idea to reach out to Elizabeth and get her thoughts, which follow below, on the Chechnya she experienced then and its connection, or lack of connection, to the men thought to have bombed the Boston Marathon."

What’s on Sunday,2013-04-21,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (13, 49) THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE Nine years after putting their extraordinary talents to use at Bletchley Park, Britain’s code-breaking headquarters during World War II, four seemingly ordinary women piece together clues they hope will solve a series of murders. Leading the charge is Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin, above), now a homemaker and mother of two, who wangles her way into Scotland Yard when she thinks she has detected a pattern to the killings. But when the police dismiss her theory, she turns for assistance to her former colleagues — Millie (Rachael Stirling), conversant in 14 languages and good with maps; Lucy (Sophie Rundle), with her photographic memory; and Jean (Julie Graham), their onetime supervisor — who, like Susan, have returned to civilian life and kept their intelligence work secret from even those closest to them. “While the solving of the mystery is fairly conventional, these amateur detectives aren’t,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. The three-part mystery “doesn’t have a preachy tone, but it does have a message, and it’s similar to the one in ‘Call the Midwife,’ “ the British series, leading in at 8, “that follows young nurses who after the war helped women in the poorest sections of London deliver babies, usually in tenement homes, on top of rags and newspapers,” she said, adding that “both series find a clever, entertaining way to pay tribute to women who in their time were often overlooked and underestimated, and nevertheless found ways to never be ordinary.”"

Now Showing | ‘Artist/Rebel/Dandy: Men of Fashion’,2013-04-22,article,News,,"['Art', 'Fashion and Apparel', 'Museums']",A new exhibition at The Museum of Art Rhode Island School of Design capitalizes on the recent surge of interest in the artistry and craftsmanship of menswear.,"Peacocking, the preening of fastidiously dressed males of the fashion flock, has been exhaustively documented of late by international street fashion photographers who track willing prey in their natural habitats: outside fashion shows, fabulous parties and glitzy store openings where the rare birds tend to gather. The origin of this dandy species, Beau Brummel (1778-1840), and his fanciful progeny are the subject of the exhibition “Artist/Rebel/Dandy: Men of Fashion” at the Museum of Art Rhode Island School of Design, opening April 28. The curators, Kate Irvin and Laurie Brewer, from the school’s department of costume and textiles, have capitalized on this recent surge of interest in the artistry and craftsmanship of men’s wear with their study of clothing and ephemera honoring the aesthetic provocateur. Aided by an archive that includes the personal wardrobe of Richard Merkin, a legendary RISD professor, painter and dandy-in-residence, the curators constructed a thematic, rather than chronological, exploration into what they term the “always provocative dandy stance.” Delving deeper than the decorative surface, they contrast the social subversion of dandy “revolutionaries,” who express political views through their personal wardrobes, with a dandy “historian’s” appreciation of tailoring tradition, while a “connoisseur” prides self-expression over societal conformity. Thom Browne says in the accompanying catalog’s preface that “Rebellion comes from being perfectly comfortable doing my own thing and having the drive to make challenging statements in men’s wear.” According to the curators, by “kicking at the boundaries of taste,” the dandy is indeed much more than the commonly criticized “superficial person devoted only to the outer shell.”"

What’s On Wednesday,2013-04-24,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"5:35 P.M. (Starz) THE IDES OF MARCH (2011) George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon received an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay for this political drama, which Mr. Clooney, above, also directed and stars in as Mike Morris, a Pennsylvania governor turned dream candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, a strategist who becomes involved with an intern (Evan Rachel Wood) with a powerful father and a secret that could derail Stephen’s career and the Morris campaign. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are senior advisers battling for Stephen’s loyalty. And Marisa Tomei is a reporter trying to get at the truth. “Mr. Clooney handles the plot complications with elegant dexterity,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of Mr. Willimon’s play “Farragut North,” loosely based on Howard Dean’s 2004 Democratic presidential primary campaign. “As an actor he works best in long, understated scenes that allow him to play with nuances of charm and menace, so it is not surprising that, as a director, he gives the rest of the cast room to work,” Mr. Scott added. “But the parts of ‘The Ides of March’ — quiet scenes between Mr. Gosling and Ms. Wood; swirling, Sorkinesque exchanges of banter; any time Ms. Tomei or Max Minghella (as a campaign worker grooming himself to be the next Stephen Meyers) are in the room — are greater than the whole.”"

Where’s the Baby?,2013-04-25,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Jennifer Gilmore’s novel centers on the complexities of adoption.,"In 1991, Kathryn Harrison published “Thicker Than Water,” a novel about a young woman struggling to come to terms with the sexual relationship she’d had with her father. Three books later, she published “The Kiss,” a memoir in which she examined, in excruciating detail, the sexual relationship she’d had with her father. In reading both of these impressive books, the line between novel and memoir unavoidably blurs. More recently, the gifted Canadian author Sheila Heti wrote “How Should a Person Be” — “a novel,” as its subtitle proclaims, “from life.” Sheila is the protagonist, surrounded by friends with the same names and occupations as those in her life off the page. This is a relatively extreme case in autobiographical fiction, more experimental than confessional, in which the niceties of inventing characters are dispensed with entirely. It’s an intriguing and sometimes unsettling decision, resulting in a sort of hybrid: not quite fiction, not quite memoir. Sitcoms have used this device for years, with stars from Ozzie and Harriet Nelson to Louis C. K. creating irreverent alternative realities modeled closely on their lives. "

Agency Halts Trial for Aids Vaccine,2013-04-26,article,Brief,,"['Vaccination and Immunization', 'Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome']","Another trial of a potential vaccine against AIDS was halted because it was not working, a federal research agency announced Thursday."," Another trial of a potential vaccine against AIDS was halted because it was not working, a federal research agency announced Thursday. The trial, known as HVTN 505, started in 2009 with 2,504 gay male volunteers in 19 cities who got three shots over eight weeks. A recent analysis by an outside monitoring board found that more volunteers who got the vaccine became infected during a follow-up period than volunteers who got a placebo. However, the numbers of men infected — 27 vaccine recipients versus 21 placebo recipients — were statistically too close to say that the test vaccine had actually increased the chances of infection, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsored the trial. Those who got the vaccine and became infected anyway also did not have less virus in their blood, the monitoring board found. The vaccine was based on an adenovirus, which causes common colds. In 2007, another trial of an adenovirus-based vaccine was halted because it was not working, and later analysis suggested that for some men — those who had previously caught adenovirus colds — the vaccine made it more likely, rather than less, that they would get infected with H.I.V.

Salter is 87, with a reputation so secure he has nothing left to prove. If there were a Mount Rushmore for writers, he’d be there already.

Revolutions Per Minute,2013-04-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Rachel Kushner’s second novel, an impressionable artist navigates the volatile worlds of New York and Rome in the 1970s.","In “The Flamethrowers,” her frequently dazzling second novel, Rachel Kushner thrusts us into the white-hot center of the 1970s conceptual art world, motorcycle racing, upper-class Italy and the rampant kidnappings and terrorism that plagued it. It’s an irresistible, high-octane mix — and a departure from the steamier pleasures of her critically acclaimed first novel, “Telex From Cuba.” The language is equally gorgeous, however, and Kushner’s insights into place, society and the complicated rules of belonging, and unbelonging, can be mordantly brilliant. None of the characters in “The Flamethrowers” are quite what they seem, fabricating pasts as nonchalantly as they throw together their art. Above all, they hunger to be seen, to distinguish themselves from the ordinary. One artist, responding to the question of why he invents, defends his florid lies as “a form of discretion.” "

They struggled to recall the events of their own daily lives when they were later quizzed about them, remembering fewer details about their experiences than their Euro-American counterparts. Qi Wang, the Cornell scholar of “cross-cultural” cognition who conducted the experiment, speculated that Asians were not more forgetful but that they had, perhaps, filtered out the contents of their own stories, deeming them unworthy of being encoded as memories in the first place.

History doesn’t record which aspects of saliva she extolled from the stage that day. Perhaps she described how art conservators are so enamored with its cleaning power they use it to dab fragile artworks. (Dishwashing detergent is a kind of simulated saliva, digesting the food you couldn’t stomach.) Or maybe she praised the people of Greece — who spit on everything as a sign of good luck — for their saliva-positive attitudes. What we do know is that her speech was a bit of a disaster. The assembled dentists regarded her blankly. She returned to her hotel room and burst into tears. “They think of it as lubricating, and that’s it!” she complained to her boyfriend."

I’m going to fix that now. Not on account of this week’s performances by two voetbal stars, Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben — but did you see those performances?! — but because an article in this weekend’s magazine includes a reference to “a Dutch proverb about high trees catching a lot of wind.” It’s the first defense Diederik Stapel, a prominent social psychologist in the Netherlands, employs to counter accusations of academic fraud.

Capp (1909-79), whose comic strip “Li’l Abner” ran for 43 years and reached 90 million readers at its peak, was a celebrity: a radio personality, magazine essayist, talk-show regular and college speaker. Among his strip’s contributions to the cultural landscape were the expression “double whammy” and the invention of Sadie Hawkins Day, a mock holiday (and national craze in its time) that inspired Sadie Hawkins dances, to which women could invite men. Underlying Capp’s antic humor and prodigious productivity, however, was a toxic chip on his shoulder. "

Allman traces five centuries of Florida history, from discovery to settlement to tourist destination.","Anyone who has commuted to a Fort Lauderdale beach will be familiar with the journey T. D. Allman describes in “Finding Florida: The True History of the Sunshine State.”Because drawbridges that lead to the ocean’s edge are raised to allow large boats up the inland waterways, highway passengers are almost invariably subjected to long waits. This imposition — and the fact that the people behind steering wheels don’t protest — drives Allman to distraction. “Not one person demands to know: Why is it that the people with boats take precedence over us?” he writes."

While the film is more lavish than Mr. Maclean’s story, and hence less commandingly precise, it radiates much the same seriousness of purpose. The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean — of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace — are ably reflected on the screen.”"

They find that offenders vary in behavior and psychology and therefore it is both hard to draw any generalizations and create effective means of prevention."

Last week NBC announced it was renewing five drama series, including two, “Revolution” and “Chicago Fire,” that the network introduced this season. “Grimm,” arguably the network’s most reliable drama, was another show that was renewed; it holds up Friday night for the network and has experienced a ratings increase of 14 percent this season. The ratings for “Law & Order Special Victims Unit” have descended to just about survival level, but that show will return in a move that has been a ritual for the network for 15 years. “Parenthood,” the well-regarded family drama that performed well this year (up 8 percent), had been truncated to only 15 episodes, a sign that the network did not have the most faith in its endurance before this season started. That was also a sign that cost was a factor in considering its fate: “Parenthood” has a big budget and an enormous cast, with several star-name actors, including Lauren Graham, Peter Krause and Dax Shepard. A renewal order had been in some doubt until last week because of those budget concerns, but NBC announced that “Parenthood” would be back and with a full order of 22 episodes. The NBC announcement didn’t stop President Obama from taking a little shot at the network’s prime-time woes at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner on Saturday night. Joking about his recent performance at a basketball demonstration, the president said: “I took 22 shots and made 2 of them. That’s right, 2 hits and 20 misses.

‘Clean: Overcoming Addiction and Ending America’s Greatest Tragedy’,2013-04-29,article,Text,,"['Drug Abuse and Traffic', 'Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers', 'Methamphetamines']",An excerpt from a new book by David Sheff on America’s drug problem and why we’ve failed in our efforts to combat it.,"The view that drug use is a moral choice is pervasive, pernicious, and wrong. So are the corresponding beliefs about the addicted — that they’re weak, selfish, and dissolute; if they weren’t, when their excessive drug taking and drinking began to harm them, they’d stop. The reality is far different. Using drugs or not isn’t about willpower or character. Most problematic drug use is related to stress, trauma, genetic predisposition, mild or serious mental illness, use at an early age, or some combination of those. Even in their relentless destruction and self-destruction, the addicted aren’t bad people. They’re gravely ill, afflicted with a chronic, progressive, and often terminal disease."
