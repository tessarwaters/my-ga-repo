Here, a gown that resembled a quivering cloud of blush-pink feathers; there, sumptuously draped, Watteau-esque garments of dusty rose and red silk. For the finale, lightweight, angel-sleeved plissé dresses in tart hues — raspberry, tangerine — swept through, the models adorned with matching floral headpieces made of chrysanthemums and orchids. There was little point in overthinking the assortment of references on display: Molly Bloom and the court of Versailles, Ziggy Stardust and classical mythology among them. Opera coats and dresses were covered in pictogramlike satin piecework depicting Pegasus and Perseus, Leda and the Swan, Europa and Taurus. This was an emotional dispatch from the domain of private fantasy, a swaggeringly exuberant collection of clothes that might make us, too, feel immortal.

With the right wet suit, you no longer need the sun, and so adventure athletes looking to escape oversaturated beach towns have over the past decades made surf spots out of less hospitable coasts: Iceland, Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula and even the Arctic. Perhaps more surprising is that, as a burgeoning cadre of enthusiasts who happen to live in landlocked areas are proving, you don’t even need sea."

Mine collectively know more about, variously, art, literary theory, theater, music, design, architecture, gardening, film and food than I ever will, and their knowledge is my delight. A successful magazine is a collection of disparate personalities with disparate interests who are all trying to tell stories using the language in which they are most fluent. Sometimes that language is literally language. But sometimes that language is a vernacular not of words, but of images: It is photography, or illustration, or graphic design, or typography."

By providing one, you become a bat landlord of sorts, which you should think of as a long-term commitment: Bats can live more than 40 years, and their babies return to where they were born. Borcherding is still monitoring boxes he built over 25 years ago. Don’t be a slumlord. “Build it to last,” says Borcherding, who uses hardwoods like white oak and black locust, exterior-grade screws and high-quality caulk to seal moisture out."

(Milkweed, $22.) Limón has a novelistic knack for scene, and the narrative lyrics in this remarkable collection, her fifth, could stand as compressed stories about anxiety and the body. “On my way to the fertility clinic, / I pass five dead animals,” one poem states. “What if, instead of carrying / a child, I am supposed to carry grief?” A MEMORY OF THE FUTURE By Elizabeth Spires. (Norton, $26.95.) Sprinkled with philosophical inquiries and Zen koans like that of the title, Spires’s contemplative sixth collection opens with delicious wordplay: A poem called “Pome” riffs on the French word for apple to imagine verse as fruitlike and alive. “Common as an apple. Or / more rare. A quince or pear,” Spires writes. “Peer in and watch it / change and darken as pomes will do.” SURGE By Etel Adnan. (Nightboat, paper, $12.95.) “In perception, redemption,” Adnan declares in this assemblage of mystical, metaphysical ideas and aphorisms, often in conversation with the dead. “We have to say yes to that fate,” she writes of mortality, “and it’s hard, the hardest.” IF YOU HAVE TO GO By Katie Ford. (Graywolf, paper, $16.) Faith and doubt — in love, in God — course through Ford’s powerful fourth book, anchored by a long sonnet sequence about the end of a marriage. “It comes, then it goes, then it never was.” FEELD By Jos Charles. (Milkweed, paper, $16.) Charles, a trans woman, turns to a sort of Chaucerian-texting hybrid in an inspired effort to find language as unstable as her experience. “Bieng a tran is a queery of crisees,” she writes, “& r brused handes r manie.”"

Though that record — the highest single-season win percentage in tennis’s so-called Open era (for a man) — remains all his. But statistics-driven godliness isn’t the sort of perfection that fascinates Mr. Faraut."

How the Trump Administration Is Remaking the Courts,2018-08-22,article,News,,"['Appointments and Executive Changes', 'United States Politics and Government']",Thanks to ruthless discipline — and a plan long in the making — the G.O.P is carrying out a sweeping transformation of the federal judiciary.,"Donald F. McGahn, the White House counsel, stood in the gilded ballroom of Washington’s Mayflower Hotel last November to address the annual meeting of the Federalist Society. He seemed humbled, even a bit awed to be delivering the Barbara K. Olson Memorial lecture, named after the conservative lawyer who died in the Sept. 11 attacks. Noting some of the legal giants who gave the Olson lecture in years past, McGahn reflected, “You hear names like Scalia, Roberts and Gorsuch and then me; one of those names really is different than the rest.” Unlike previous speakers — to say nothing of many of those to whom he was now speaking — McGahn, himself a member of the Federalist Society, hadn’t attended an Ivy League law school; he went to Widener University, a “second tier” law school in Pennsylvania. He had never held a tenured professorship or boasted an appellate practice, much less a judgeship, that required him to think deeply about weighty constitutional issues; he specialized in the comparably mundane and technical field of campaign finance and election law. “But here we are,” McGahn said to the audience, almost apologetically. In 2015, Donald Trump hired McGahn to be the lawyer for his long-shot presidential campaign. Then, after Trump shockingly won the election, he tapped McGahn, who had proved his talent and loyalty during the campaign, to be White House counsel. Trump, in other words, had made McGahn’s wildest dreams come true. Now, McGahn told the Federalist Society, Trump was going to make their wildest dreams come true, too."
When the Supreme Court Lurches Right,2018-08-22,article,News,,"['Conservatism (US Politics)', 'United States Politics and Government', 'Law and Legislation', 'Constitution (US)']",What happens when the Supreme Court becomes significantly more conservative than the public? ,"In 1957, Robert A. Dahl, a father of modern political science, published a canonical article about the Supreme Court’s “most peculiar position” in American democracy. “Much of the legitimacy of the Court’s decisions rests upon the fiction that it is not a political institution but exclusively a legal one,” Dahl wrote. And yet, “from time to time its members decide cases where legal criteria are not in any realistic sense adequate to the task.” These decisions, among the court’s most momentous, turned on vague or ambiguous words in the Constitution, like “establishment of religion” and “due process of law,” with precedent and expert opinions on both sides. By making these rulings, the court cast itself as a “national policymaker” — and in so doing raised a difficult question: When should the justices, unelected figures in robes, reflect majority will and when should they stand for “Right or Justice” so as to protect minorities from tyranny by the majority?"
