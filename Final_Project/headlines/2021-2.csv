From there, assorted selections of onigiri are being sold from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., daily through March 7. Previously, the window sold bento boxes, but the management decided to switch to onigiri. One reason was to offer freshly milled rice from the 2020 harvest in Niigata Prefecture, north of Tokyo. It’s being processed at the Rice Factory in Scarsdale, N.Y. The quality of the rice is as essential for onigiri as it is for sushi, but onigiri is more snack than art. Usually offered in tidy nori wraps for easy transport, the fillings are humbler than the masterfully sliced fish of sushi, and include canned tuna with mayonnaise, fried chicken and breaded pork tonkatsu, $3.75 to $5 each. There are also assortments, with side dishes like miso soup and potato croquettes, that can be delivered for an extra fee. Get a couple of these sets and some sake or beer, and you have an izakaya at home. The onigiri come packaged in special paper used for wrapping food for 1,500 years. The restaurant has never served onigiri, but it will start when it reopens for indoor dining on Sunday. "

Will they actually happen?","Anyone searching for an economic road map to the Biden presidency might find hints of one in a 40-page research paper written, appropriately enough, by the United Automobile Workers union. The document, originally published in 2018 and titled “Taking the High Road: Strategies for a Fair E.V. Future,” argued that even in the face of foreign competition, the American automobile industry could continue to provide well-paying manufacturing jobs — but only if the government invested huge sums in electric vehicles.

The U.A.W.’s researchers insisted, for example, that critical parts like batteries must be produced at home, not by rival industrial powers. “The economic potential of E.V.s will be lost if their components are imported,” they wrote. “Advanced vehicle technology should be treated as a strategic sector to be protected and built in the U.S.”"

With no clear destination, the steps become an abstraction, more sculpture than architecture. Beside the staircase and around a corner, another door opens into a dim foyer — a shock of darkness — leading to a short, labyrinthine corridor that ends, suddenly, in an expansive covered terrace, its 15-foot-high roof raised on a raft of pine beams, an archway framing the winding branches of a guamúchil tree."

Case in point: Bulgari’s new three-ring collar, which evokes the 1980s, a time of exceptional postmodern verve, but also the otherworldly adornment of Cleopatra’s Egypt.

Set on a pink-gold armature made in the house’s signature proto-industrial tubogas style — an unsoldered, flexible spiral inspired by early 20th-century underground gas pipes — the piece has a futuristic brio: the perfect amulet to encircle the neck of a superhero of any era, but especially our own.

Penfolds Releases Wines Made From American Grapes,2021-02-16,article,News,,"['Wines', 'Cabernet Sauvignon (Wine)']",The winemaker’s new line is a blend of California and Australian harvests.,"Wines from outside Europe are often called New World wines. Penfolds, one of Australia’s premier wineries, is doubling down on being New World with its new California Collection, half of which consists of blends of cabernet sauvignon and shiraz (syrah) from California and Australia. Penfolds has been interested in California since the 1980s, and after considerable experimentation, it is now releasing four wines made mainly from grapes grown there, some from Australian cuttings it planted, blended with Penfolds fruit from Australia. The California varietals dominate. The powerful and complex top-of-the-line, Quantum Bin 98 cabernet sauvignon ($700 a bottle), which deserves cellaring, and the somewhat earthier and fruitier Bin 149 cabernet sauvignon ($149), both blends that include Australian wine, are labeled Wines of the World. There is also Bin 704 Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, which is all California ($70) absent sweetness or oaky swagger, but with a whiff of Napa Valley-style eucalyptus as it opens up. Bin 600 California cabernet-shiraz ($50) is the lightest, yet forceful and ready to drink. These wines, all 2018, all have a consistent bold, muscular character, with well-knit fruit, structure and acidity, described as the “house style” by Peter Gago, the winemaker. Each wine’s alcohol content is around 14.5 percent."

More than two centuries later, men and women jostle in all matters of public life, and yet their likenesses in the public space do not. In the United Kingdom, by one estimate, only some 3 percent of public statues are of nonroyal women. The number is thought to be about 7 percent in the United States, but in New York City, up until last summer, there were famously only five statues of historic women: the Catholic saint Joan of Arc, the former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, the Modernist writer Gertrude Stein, the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and the abolitionist Harriet Tubman.

There was the Grasshopper, built in 1966, an abstract wood-and-glass structure that, with its sharp, tilting angles, looked as if it were going to jump off the beach in Southampton; the Milk Carton (1958), a rectangular box turned at a 45 degree angle to the sea in Ocean Bay Park on Fire Island; and the Double Diamond (1959), made of two congruent 17-foot-tall cedar cubes, balanced on their edges, that resemble a pair of binoculars pointed toward the horizon in Westhampton Beach. In the latter home — one of the few projects of Geller’s that’s still standing — the void between the two pods is filled with triangular windows at both the north and south sides, and a tall brick chimney painted in swirling sky blue and white stripes rises from the facade like a candy cane. These buildings were celebrated not only for their playfulness and practicality — Geller, who died in 2011 at age 87, believed homes had a better chance of weathering gale-force winds if their leading edges faced the water — but also for their accessibility, given that most of his designs cost under $10,000 to build."

But it wasn’t until 2019 that Horn, 65, started to keep track of time in a way that’s more familiar to the rest of us: “I like the word ‘log’ as opposed to ‘diary’ or ‘journal,’” she said. “I’m not telling you what I’m doing every day.

She was in her early 40s. Fifteen years earlier, O’Grady had worked as an intelligence analyst for the federal government. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, she was tasked with reading around 10 international newspapers a day and, as she likes to say, “at a certain point, words just became gelatinous.” But from that experience O’Grady was able to extract new meaning out of language. “I did a poem a week, and when I got to the four-month mark, they started taking off, and I could tell something was happening,” she says, though the knowledge that her own ideas could carry her from one place or plane to the next must have already been familiar. In addition to her time in Washington D. C., her pre-artist life included stints as a translator, a teacher, a student of fiction at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop and, as if she weren’t already intimidating enough, a rock critic. “I don’t feel I’ve had much unlived life,” says O’Grady, now 86."
