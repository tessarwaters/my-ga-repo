It’s not the rabbits and deer that get into her crop, though — it’s her 1 1/2-year-old son, Ezra, who’s in the “very active” phase familiar to so many parents of toddlers. “He’s totally into everything in the garden, ripping up the plants,” she says. Fortunately, there’s plenty for him to explore. Since late March, the family has been living in Chatham, in a renovated 18th-century Colonial house that once served as a general store, and that provides easy access to the sort of fresh, wholesome foods (grains, beans, nuts and seeds) and seasonal produce Chaplin is known to favor. This is what many people eat or aspire to eat today, but Chaplin, who grew up on a farm in New South Wales, Australia, and honed her skills as a private chef and at restaurants including the now-closed Angelica Kitchen in Manhattan, is able to transform her healthful ingredients — often with the help of fermented garnishes — into complex, craveable dishes, examples of which fill her two award-winning cookbooks, “At Home in the Whole Food Kitchen” (2014) and “Whole Food Cooking Every Day” (2019)."

Who Should Get a Covid-19 Vaccine First?,2020-11-05,article,News,,"['Vaccination and Immunization', 'Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)', 'Research']","It depends on a complicated interplay of transmission rates, available doses and societal goals.","In the United States, the standard approach to distributing a routine vaccine is based on the assumption that there will be plenty of doses available. Ideally, everyone will then follow their doctors’ recommendations when it comes to being immunized against the germ in question. As a practical matter, though, rarely are both of those conditions fully met. Some people are unable to get a vaccine; others refuse it. (For the 2019-20 season, the influenza vaccine was distributed to about half the U.S. population.) The next-best vaccination outcome is the inoculation of enough people so that, together with those who are immune after being infected, there are too few available hosts for the pathogen to circulate widely in the population — a situation known as herd immunity."

Now!” 2020 screams in our faces, constantly, like a bullying mindfulness coach. And yet we can also feel ourselves being pulled out into the deep stretch of history. We are so clearly living through the worst chapters of a civics textbook.

These were largely (though not exclusively) midcentury dwellings — some neglected, others wildly overgrown — on or in the park that seemed to reify my sense of the city’s layered strangeness, of its mystery and opportunity for discovery. Even more than other European cities, Berlin is marked by the remains of all kinds of ideologies past, from the TV Tower in the vast main square, Alexanderplatz, a retro-future icon erected in the late 1960s by the East German government in a now poignant display of might, to the buildings the Nazis left behind. (Hitler never did fully realize his vision of a rebuilt Berlin as the capital of “Germania,” but the kind of neo-Classical bombast he had in mind is evident in the Olympic Stadium, which he commissioned shortly after he took power in 1933 and was completed in time for the 1936 Summer Games, and the limestone Tempelhof Airport terminal, which was constructed between 1936 and 1941 and, following the war, became a site of the airlift that sustained the city with food and supplies when Stalin blocked access to West Berlin.)

Now, Cassina has brought it to life.","The Turin, Italy-born artist Giacomo Balla was among the great early 20th-century Futurists — radical thinkers who venerated the automobile, the airplane and the kinetic, sometimes violent power of modern life. Influenced by Cubism’s fractured light and geometry, as well as the motion of Étienne-Jules Marey’s pioneering chronophotography, Balla captured the era’s dynamism with such paintings as his 1912 “Girl Running on a Balcony” but also turned his brightly hued abstractions into furniture, lampshades and avant-garde clothing. In 1917, he flipped over a couple of discarded photographs and sketched a folding screen, coloring it with tempera and pencil. The drawing remained unpublished until it appeared in a 1968 Balla monograph, but now Cassina has produced the partition, silk-screened on both sides of an asymmetrically cut wooden armature with satin-brass hinges. The colors pictured here are those that Balla himself specified: a smoldering combination of cinnabar, citron and deep forest. (Another iteration is available in blues and sage green on a white background.) The future, it seems, with all its vivid contradictions, has arrived at last."

It’s the how they did it, I think, rather than the self-evident why, that keeps us fascinated by tales of con artists and “visionaries,” the gurus and hucksters, schemers and dreamers, the online dating scammers — all of our 21st-century buccaneers of society, politics and commerce. From the small-time grifters like Anna Sorokin, who adopted the last name Delvey to masquerade in downtown New York circles as a European heiress for four years before she was convicted of second-degree grand larceny in 2019, to the murderous faux WASP “Clark Rockefeller,” as the serial impostor Christian Gerhartsreiter was known until his clubby life was upended by kidnapping charges in 2008, all impostors come equipped with a tall tale and a look to match. In Sorokin’s case, it seemed to be largely about the chunky Celine glasses, code for jolie-laide cool; in Gerhartsreiter’s, it was the Lacoste shirts and East Coast lockjaw copied from the millionaire character on “Gilligan’s Island.” The nose ring and “street” argot of Jessica Krug, a.k.a., Jess La Bombalera — the white professor of history and Africana studies whose career until a few months ago had rested in good part upon a racial identity that was not, in fact, her own — the black turtlenecks and baritone of Theranos’s Elizabeth Holmes, accused of defrauding investors of millions with shoddy blood-testing technology, even the normcore terry-cloth sweatband and neuroleptic philosophizing of Nxivm’s Keith Raniere, the volleyball enthusiast who ran a self-actualization scheme that preyed upon the bodies and wallets of women: All have become metonyms of the actual offenses, clues to self-delusions."

Revisiting an Ancient Theory of Herbalism,2020-11-12,article,News,,"['Flowers and Plants', 'Herbs', 'Alternative and Complementary Medicine']","In our own era of mysterious diseases, the supposition that some plants might cure the human organs they most resemble is surfacing once more.","HOW, I HAVE often wondered, did people first discover the highly specific applications of particular plants and herbs? That ginseng improves energy, say, or that ginger alleviates nausea, or that horsetail, which contains silica, might help hair to grow? One theory, possibly apocryphal and certainly much maligned by modern medicine, is that the physical characteristics of plants themselves provided clues as to how they might be used. This notion, known among scholars of ethnobotany and practitioners of herbal medicine as the doctrine of signatures, holds that plants have a “signature” — color, texture, shape, scent, even the environment in which they grow — that resembles the body parts and diseases they heal. Thus bloodroot, or Sanguinaria canadensis, whose roots and rhizomes secrete a red sap when cut, was once thought to heal blood disorders and hasten wound healing. And eyebright, or euphrasia, whose flowers resemble the human eye (or rather, with its yellow dots and purple stripes, a jaundiced, bloodshot one), has for centuries been used to treat ocular ailments, like conjunctivitis. (In German, eyebright is called Augentrost, or “consolation of the eyes.”) Signatures, in other words, made it easy to divine a plant’s medicinal properties.

As might be expected of someone who began his career as a ballet dancer, the designer’s sinuous pieces don’t merely adorn the body, they pour over it. This necklace, a serpentine armature of rose gold with pavé diamonds, incorporates an elegant palette that is pure Hermès: apple-green prehnite cabochons, a pale blue-gray sapphire and pink, brown and blue tourmalines. At once subtle and sumptuous, the collar is engineered as cleverly as a good stiletto: You barely know you’re wearing it. Hermès À l’Écoute necklace, price on request, hermes.com."

Often the pain is concentrated in the big toe, ridiculous, stubby and chubby, Napoleonic, the fat piggy sent to market. So acute is the sensitivity of this bloated hallux — “so exquisite and lively,” in the words of the 17th-century English physician Thomas Sydenham, chronicling his bouts with the disease — that the faintest footfall of a sympathetic visitor is a gunshot straight to the nerve. The American poet and novelist Jim Harrison, writing in 1991, likened his throes to those of “a wolf with the steel teeth of a trap buried in its paw.” It will not help, at such a moment, to recall that Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton and Henry James reportedly suffered thus, and that you have joined, in your abasement, the noblest ranks."

When he leaves office, it will present the country with a historic dilemma.","Early in November, as President Trump challenged the integrity of the election with baseless lawsuits, Joe Biden delivered his first speech as president-elect, declaring it a “time to heal.” It was a phrase that many Americans were surely longing to hear, given the precarious state of the nation’s political culture.

Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal, he, too, spoke about the need for “healing.” (Ford titled his subsequent memoir “A Time to Heal.”) When President Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address during the waning days of the Civil War, he spoke in similar terms about the imperative to “bind up the nation’s wounds.” Whether Biden intended to do so, his words provided an early signal about one of the first questions he is going to confront as president: What to do about Donald Trump?

T Black Book: Florists,2020-11-18,article,News,,"['Flowers and Plants', 'Gardens and Gardening', 'Florists', 'Design']","Where you can find the most singular flower arrangements in six major cities, from New York to Tokyo.","There is, arguably, never a bad time to send flowers. But in a year marked by both isolation and turmoil, a delivery of blooms, a gift that also helps support financially hard-hit small businesses, feels especially poignant. And so for the first in our new series of Black Book guides, we’ve created a directory of the most imaginative and masterful florists working today in six major cities. These 22 designers make arrangements that are often wildly different in style, ranging from understated bouquets to experimental showpieces, and we’ve tried to offer a range of “classic,” “earthy” and “unusual” options in each place. But if these florists’ aesthetics are diverse — informed by everything from old master paintings to modern dance — they all bring a singular vision to the centuries-old art they practice. Many are also united in rejecting the methods of the contemporary globalized flower trade, in which blooms are cut sometimes months before they’re sold, sprayed with toxic preservatives and then shipped great distances at great environmental cost. Some are instead championing local growers and avoiding harmful substances like flower foam, while others are even cultivating their own flowers or privileging historically overlooked materials such as seedpods, roots and weeds. At the bottom of this article you’ll find a downloadable guide with delivery information that we hope will serve as a useful, and much turned to, resource."

Nina Chanel Abney Imagines a Queer Black Utopia,2020-11-19,article,News,,"['Art', 'Content Type: Personal Profile', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Museums']","The artist’s new body of work depicts life outside of the city, in a rural idyll free of the white gaze.","By the beginning of this year, the artist Nina Chanel Abney’s studio, a 1,500-square-foot space in a multiuse building in Jersey City, N.J., that she’s rented since 2018, had begun to feel like a storage room. Stacks of boxes filled with books and products she’d made, as well as paintings — both her own and ones she’d purchased — lined the walls, and the countertops of the kitchenette were barely visible beneath the countless cases of spray paint piled on top of them. When the pandemic hit New Jersey in March, and the state went into lockdown, Abney — who also lives in the building, in an apartment a few flights below — became even more aware of her spatial confines. And so, in May, she bought a bike and a rack for her car and began taking road trips to rural areas outside of the city to find some relief from all the time spent indoors. Inspired in part by these excursions, Abney’s new body of work conveys a sense of expansiveness — one that she also found in the form of an additional studio that she rented in the same building this fall. This larger temporary space, with a view of the Manhattan skyline, gave the artist enough room to finish the 22 paintings — ranging from 2 feet by 2 feet to 8 feet by 8 feet — that are currently on display in “The Great Escape,” a solo exhibition at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York."

They issued the nation’s first shelter in place order, promptly shut down schools and businesses and made masks routine. It worked: The city has experienced some of the lowest test positivity rates in the country.Now, city officials are forging ahead with a tentative school reopening plan hatched earlier this month, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time.

Virus rates are suddenly spiking, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday to issue a nighttime curfew affecting nearly every county in the state, though San Francisco is below the threshold. As a result, officials here face pushback from some unions, teachers and parents.Whether San Francisco ultimately proceeds can be a bellwether: If schools cannot reopen here where virus rates remain comparatively low, what hope do other cities have for a return to something resembling normalcy?There is mounting evidence that prolonged distance learning could have long-term effects on schoolchildren and their families, including higher dropout rates and lower income in later years.

How to Get in Sync With Someone,2020-11-24,article,News,,"['Content Type: Service', 'Romani People']","Don’t talk. Try a rhythmic activity such as walking, dancing, marching, or drumming.","“Don’t talk,” says Natalie Sebanz, a professor of cognitive science at Central European University in Austria. “The verbal stuff gets in the way.” Sebanz and two colleagues conducted an experiment in Hungary, where the country’s largest minority, the Roma, have long suffered discrimination. The researchers recruited non-Roma subjects and, after evaluating their bias against the Roma, had them walk silently around a large lecture hall alongside a Roma person; they did this for three minutes either in sync, matching footfalls or without any coordination. The subjects who synced their strides with a Roma reported less prejudice and stereotyping toward both their walking partner and the Roma as a group. “You tend to like people more and become more prosocial if you engage in synchronous behavior with them,” Sebanz says."

Brown: An Excerpt",2020-11-24,article,Review,,[],"An excerpt from “The Last American Aristocrat: The Brilliant Life and Improbable Education of Henry Adams,” by David S. Brown","In the Education’s double-edged opening pages, Adams recalls a golden nativity: “Probably no child, born in the year, held better cards than he.” From there, the narrative, interested in the price of privilege, moves on to an involved, ironic discussion surveying the special burdens of belonging to a pedigree of presidents. Henry knew well each hurdle before him. Raised, as he put it, in the long shadows cast by “the First Church, the Boston State House, Beacon Hill, John Hancock and John Adams,” he internalized past glories, old prejudices, and dying traditions. This demanding ancestor worship, as stifling as a posh sarcophagus, led eventually to a self-imposed Washington exile where, in the nation’s capital city, he produced a vast nine-volume history of the early American republic, in whose final book he dedicated an epitaphic chapter to the “decline of Massachusetts.” An efficient autopsy of the Bay State’s imminent eclipse before the combined might of the slaveholding South and the democratic West, it might be said to have served as spadework for the one puzzling question never far from his thoughts: How did the prized child, the holder of so many “better cards,” come to lose the hand?"
