If you’re a publishing geek like me, you’ll notice how many popular writers profess to be grateful to independent bookstores for the success of their novels, memoirs, thrillers, picture books and self-help guides — but mosey over to their personal pages and you’ll find click-to-buy links that whisk you directly to Jeff Bezos’ Everything Store (do not pass an artfully curated front window, do not hear bells chime as you walk in the front door, do not collect a free bookmark by the cash register). Yes, there is the ease of one-click ordering your next read along with your paper towels; yes, if you present purchasing buttons in alphabetical order, Amazon will land at the top of the list. But if you are an author, like Towles, who claims to appreciate local bookshops for “hand selling” your work, why not direct your readers straight to Indiebound, which helps keep the light on in those stores?

Le Moné, a new Meyer lemon drink made in Hammondsport, N.Y., has enough bright, citric flavor to cancel winter. It is called an aperitif wine because its base alcohol is wine, from the Finger Lakes region in western New York. Eric Bachli, a former brewmaster at Sixpoint Brewery in Brooklyn, collaborated with Max Nevins, also of Sixpoint Brewery, and Marissa Reiser, a sommelier, to create the aperitif. California brandy adds a kick to the 32 proof drink. Restrained sweetening is provided by organic blue agave syrup from Mexico, and Meyer lemons, mostly from a distillate using the peels, create the lightly bitter citric profile. It’s mellow yet refreshing on the rocks or in a spritz; it finds its calling added to dry gin, martini-style with a twist. It’s now shipped to a handful of states, a list that will expand in coming months."

Furthermore, clothes that serve multiple purposes, says Laub, encourage shoppers to “buy better and buy less.”"

McShea started out in photography while Mosa trained as a goldsmith, but the two, now partners in work and in life, have long been preoccupied with the interaction between fabric and the elements. In 2018, inspired by the Baroque frescoes at the 13th-century Palazzo Monti, in Brescia, Italy, where they were artists-in-residence, they developed a series of ephemeral sculptures by wrapping stone staircases in ribbons and photographing fabric in water. As an afterthought, they also created a flag made of ribbons fixed to a cardboard tube with masking tape. Though it was simple, they felt it had power and, sure enough, things took off two summers later, when the duo began sewing colorful hand-dyed silks, deadstock ribbons and tulle to lengths of ribbon that, doubled over, acted as halyards — or, as they refer to them, hoist ribbons — and tying those with simple bows to scavenged bamboo poles, which they planted on the beaches of Fire Island Pines."

If he weren’t an artist, though, he might be a linguist, a semiotics professor or a rapper. Or at least that’s the sense you get after spending time with his “Slanguage” paintings, which are imbued with messages that aren’t immediately apparent, and that often require knowledge of wordplay to decode. The series began, in 2019, as a shout-out to regional slang from Oakland, Calif., and the rest of the Bay Area. Take “Yay Area” (2020), a realist composition that brings together recognizable and mundane food items: a Coca-Cola bottle turned on its side, a chocolate layer cake atop a pedestal and a glass bowl filled with scoops of vanilla ice cream. At first glance, the still life, which recalls the work of the American painter Wayne Thiebaud, impresses with its skill and precision and evokes nostalgia for sugary childhood treats. Depending on your familiarity with certain hip-hop lyrics, though, it may later occur to you that the artist has depicted foods whose names, like the “Yay” of the title, are slang for cocaine (coke, cola, cake), and one that references the Oakland artist Dru Down’s 1993 song “Ice Cream Man,” its title an allusion to a drug dealer (though he’s hardly the only rapper to have used the term). Another work of Chew’s, “Ball Street Journal” (2020), includes images of cheese, bread and paper — all terms for money."
