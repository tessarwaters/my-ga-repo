Wild Alaskan King Salmon Season Has Begun,2021-05-03,article,News,,"['Salmon', 'Mail Order Companies']",Alaskan Salmon processes the fish from the Copper River and sends the delicacy nationwide.,"The wild Alaskan king salmon season started last month, but the catch from the prized Copper River fishery will not be available for another two weeks. Anticipating high demand, a number of companies are already accepting preorders for the richly flavored fish that has packed on fat and muscle so it can strive against the current, up the river to spawning grounds. A relative newcomer to the game is Kyle Lee, an Alaskan whose company, Alaskan Salmon in Cordova, operates on a smaller scale than some others; it is run by fishermen. The fish are frozen upon harvesting and shipped that way directly to consumers, the typical practice. Alaskan Salmon will charge $75 a pound (about three portions) in five-pound boxes for $375. They also have Copper River sockeye, the vermilion variety, $250 for five pounds."
Olive Oil Conquers the Plant-Based Dessert,2021-05-03,article,News,,"['Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts', 'Olive Oil']","Wildgood, a new frozen dessert brand from a Greek ice cream specialist, is an airy confection made with extra-virgin olive oil.","Plant-based versions of ice cream (which cannot use the term cream) are proliferating faster than new flavors from Ben & Jerry’s. Every possible alternative “milk” — pressed from beans, grains, nuts and so forth — now beckon as vanilla and chocolate in the frozen food aisle. A newcomer, Wildgood, has taken a somewhat different approach, with a vegan frozen dessert that relies on olive oil. It’s the result of eight years of trial and error by Sotiris Tsichlopoulos, who studied gelato in Italy and created an ice cream brand in Greece. Among the ingredients that help turn extra-virgin olive oil into a frozen confection are chicory root, pea protein and carob-bean gum. It’s around 10 percent fat, and there are eight flavors: chocolate, vanilla bean, coffee, mango, mint-chocolate chip, sea salt caramel and the best of the lot, pistachio and chocolate-hazelnut. Perhaps using nuts helps with the texture because despite the olive oil, the end result has more of an ice milk lightness instead of the dense richness of a super-premium product. Mr. Tsichlopoulos’s company has support from Gary Hirshberg, a founder of Stonyfield Farm, among others."

A Sauvignon Blanc From Sonoma,2021-05-03,article,News,,['Wines'],"After a small test release last year, La Crema is making a sauvignon blanc widely available just in time for summer.","It’s never too late to try something new. La Crema, a Sonoma County winery that is known for chardonnay and pinot noir, has introduced a sauvignon blanc. The winery, established in 1979, released the 2019 sauvignon blanc on a limited basis last summer; now the 2020 is widely available. It’s a lovely summer quaff. “The climate and soils of northern Sonoma County are ideal for producing world-class Bordeaux varietals, particularly sauvignon blanc,” said Craig McAllister, the head winemaker. Bordeaux is the operative term here. The wine, in a clear Bordeaux-style bottle, displays more subtle fruit, notably citrus and pineapple, integrated with good acidity, than the grassy herbaceousness typical of sauvignon blancs from other regions. What La Crema has done echoes Sonoma-Cutrer’s introduction in 2015 of its first sauvignon blanc."

Then came the rise of bold, musky ‘oriental’ scents, which revealed much about the West’s perception of Eastern culture.","I REMEMBER AS IF it were yesterday that distant afternoon on which I first smelled oudh. I was in my grandmother’s house in Delhi. I was 13, maybe 14. We had a family perfumer, or attarwallah, a man of some refinement, who came to us from Lucknow — a city that is a metonym for high Indo-Islamic culture. We didn’t know the attarwallah’s name, or how he knew to follow us from address to change of address. But he came without fail two or three times a year. A slim, gliding figure, with a mouth reddened from paan, or betel leaf and areca nut, the attarwallah produced his wares from carved bottles of colored glass that he carried in a black leather doctor’s bag. He showed us scents according to which season we were in. So in winter, musk and patchouli; in summer, white-flowered varieties of jasmine — of which there are some 40 odd in India — as well as rose and vetiver. In the monsoon, he brought us mitti attar, which imitates the smell of parched earth exhaling after the first rain (“mitti” means “mud” in Hindi). The perfumes came from the medieval Indian town of Kannauj, which is a 75-mile drive west of Lucknow and which, like its French counterpart, Grasse, has a tradition of perfume manufacturing several centuries old. Once he had drawn his perfume out on white cotton buds at the tips of long, thin sticks, the attarwallah lingered over his customers, telling stories of the various scents and reciting the odd romantic couplet of Urdu poetry."

Short as trees go, it has a hunkered-down look, its branches starting low to the ground and crooking and knotting as they rise. The most prized species make their home in the gullies and wadis of Dhofar in southern Oman and Hadhramaut in war-torn eastern Yemen, and along the cliffs and scarps of the Cal Madow mountains in Somaliland, whose 1991 declaration of independence from Somalia has gone unrecognized by the rest of the world. The Indigenous people of these regions brave snakes and scorpions to climb the trees and press a knife to the papery bark, just enough to break through the green skin beneath.

The ability to say “I’m beautiful” — and to really, truly believe it — may not be a fundamental right, but it, too, is revolutionary in its way, reflective of contemporary upheavals in how we perceive race, gender, sexuality, ability and size. Who gets to be beautiful now? Anyone who believes themselves to be so."

In the kitchen, she prepared the woman’s hair for a wash by removing the extensions that she had previously put in, using her shears to snip the tiny stitches that fastened the wefts — individual strands of hair that are sewn together to create extensions — to her client’s cornrows. Once she had taken those out, LaVar began to unravel the minuscule braids she had plaited months before, starting at the nape. Using her fingers, she carefully unwound them section by section, until all that was left was the woman’s natural hair. After her client took a shower in one of her four bathrooms, LaVar blow-dried her hair and, over the next hour, once again braided each section of the soft hair into thin cornrows. The woman’s hair was naturally fine and, because she often attended events, she was accustomed to this laborious, time-consuming process."

In Egypt’s Karnak village, beginning in the 16th century B.C., temples served as early shops and produced scented oils used for perfuming the living, embalming the dead, softening the skin and hair, covering up bad breath and easing sore muscles. In 17th-century Europe, apothecaries sold raw materials — plant oils, mineral powders — that enabled patrons to whip up their own potions to disguise concerns such as gray hair and wrinkles. And as the definition of beauty has evolved, so, too, has the function of the beauty shop. Today, when we tend to think of beauty in more holistic terms, the places that sell creams, powders and pigments are often more than merely points for picking up curative goods: They can be sanctuaries for gathering, broadening the mind, stimulating the senses and perhaps even stirring the soul. In a year when it’s been difficult to physically visit shops, their value has never been more apparent. Here, as part of T’s Beauty & Luxury issue, we pay tribute to just some of our favorite beauty institutions — the sort of spots that feel like discoveries — from a centuries-old perfumery in New Delhi to a sustainably minded apothecary in Vienna to a futuristic emporium-cum-gallery in Seoul."

He sensed, and then came to know, that the social problems of what was being called “postindustrial” society would be different from those that came before. He identified these problems, sometimes controversially. In so doing, he predicted the dislocations of the 21st century with uncanny accuracy. He did it with elegance and wit and — this may be a surprise — transcendent humility. His spot-on sense of what truly mattered deserves to be revisited now, if we’re to grope our way past the mess we’ve become as a society."

He details the history of barbecue back to its Indigenous roots in pre-Columbian days, and recounts how it became part of the culture of enslaved Africans.

Instead of pit-roasted whole hogs, smaller cuts of meat like ribs and brisket were used because they were easier to handle in restaurants, and chefs got involved. Now the recognition is improving, he says, but there is work to be done. The book is seasoned with profiles of Black barbecue notables and a smattering of recipes."
