As a nuisance? An opportunity? Collateral damage? A blob of molten plastic to be injected into a minion-­shaped mold? One of the funniest answers to this question comes from the comedian Conner O’Malley, who has built a career playacting the way consumerism warps our spirits. Out on the street, he has recorded dozens of videos in which he plays, basically, capitalism’s hype man — a loudmouthed white dude-bro who is perpetually awed by advertising and luxury goods. He will rush up to anyone who looks rich — men in suits, men driving ostentatious cars — and slather them with over-­the-­top compliments that lean heavily on the word “pimp.” “Oh, hell yeah, pimp!” he shouts into a convertible. When a Hummer stops near him, O’Malley rushes toward its open window: “Man, you’re a job creator, you’re a pimp, you’re an angel, and I love you forever!” His brain seems full of targeted ads. He accosts a businessman on a cellphone: “Dude, what’s up? Maxim Magazine, am I right?” Sometimes O’Malley’s circuitry seems to misfire, but there is no time to stop and think — he will stand in front of a Mustang and chant: “Steroids! Steroids! Steroids!”"

"‘Something That May Shock and Discredit You,’ by Daniel Mallory Ortberg: An Excerpt",2020-02-11,article,Review,,[],"An excerpt from “Something That May Shock and Discredit You,” by Daniel Mallory Ortberg","One generally grows up thinking about the Rapture a great deal or not at all. Most don’t, I think, but among those who did, there’s always the question of how, if at all, to bring up the subject in mixed company, whether in the hopes of eliciting either laughter or shock, followed by sexual intrigue mixed with pity. It’s easy enough to sell out an evangelical Christian childhood, and plenty of other pens have been given over to the subject of whether it’s a good idea to raise children in the expectation of being swept up by the Raisin Bran scoop of heaven; I have no wish to dwell on the question of whether I ought to have been taught about the Rapture. No one consulted me beforehand, and I can’t see why I should be asked to provide an opinion on the subject now. I was roughly as afraid of the Rapture as I was of being the last person in the house who left the basement at nighttime and had to turn the lights out before I went up the stairs – it felt variously real and ridiculous depending on how close I was to being alone. Afternoons where I was the first person to come home after school and the neighborhood seemed slightly emptier than usual were ideal for Rapture practice, for seeing if I could gin up sufficient panic and remorse at the prospect of being unscooped; playing DC Talk’s cover of “I Wish We’d All Been Ready” sometimes helped, but more often than not just made me even more self-conscious of having to trick myself into getting in the mood."

"In Los Angeles, a Historic Home Becomes an Experimental Kitchen",2020-02-11,article,News,,"['Parties (Social)', 'Art']","At the Schindler House, a celebration of art, design and fermentation.","In food, fermentation — the process by which enzymes from microorganisms break down carbohydrates — is both an ancient practice and a recent trend. Cheese, made from cultured milk, was being produced in present-day Iraq around 7,000 B.C., and the Chinese are thought to have started making sake from fermented rice a couple of millenniums later. Over the past decade, chefs and diners have been drawn to all manner of fermented produce, as well as to fermented staples like kombucha and kimchi, sourdough and cider, for their tangy flavors and presumed digestive health benefits. Perhaps surprisingly, so have artists, though for their own reasons. In response to a report that a Chinese factory was making soy sauce out of fermented hair, the Miami-based artist Nicolas Lobo fermented some of his own in 2012. During last December’s Faena Festival, part of Miami Art Week, the installation artist Emeka Ogboh served a craft ale with notes of lime and pepper meant to nod to the city’s diversity of dwellers that he’d brewed in the hopes of sparking conversation about immigration and globalization. And Arden Surdam, who lives in Los Angeles and works primarily in photography, is currently collaborating with microbiologists from University of California, San Diego, to develop a bioreactor that will use fermentation to desaturate the pigmentation and decrease the potency of harmful algae blooms. (Also see the Toronto-based curator Lauren Fournier’s ongoing series examining fermentation through a feminist lens, which led to the 2019 book “Critical Booch.”)"

What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘The Farewell’ and ‘Big Cat Country’,2020-02-12,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",Lulu Wang’s indie hit is streaming on Amazon. And a new nature series debuts on the Smithsonian Channel.,"THE FAREWELL (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. While it may not have garnered any Academy Award nominations, this comedic drama from Lulu Wang netted a Golden Globe for its star, Awkwafina, and was among the highest-grossing indie movies of 2019. Based on an experience from Wang’s own life (or, as the film puts it, “based on an actual lie”), “The Farewell” casts Awkwafina as Billi, a young, creative New Yorker who learns that her overseas grandmother (played by Zhao Shuzhen) has a terminal illness. Billi travels with her parents to the northern Chinese city of Changchun, where her grandmother lives, but not before reluctantly agreeing to terms set by the rest of the family: Nobody is permitted to tell the matriarch about her illness. What follows is a bittersweet story that plumbs family relationships and cultural differences. The film “has a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Much of the charm and power of this story — about events leading up to a wedding that’s also a fake funeral of sorts — come from the palpable sense that it genuinely happened to someone.”"

The Met has never before presented an exhibition of art from the West Indies, and it concentrates here on the ritual objects — thrones, vessels and mysterious bird-shaped stones — of the Taíno people, who inhabited the islands now called Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Turks and Caicos.

As the Met begins renovations of its Rockefeller Wing, the Caribbean offers its curators a priceless model of how to think about world cultures: never “pure” but in constant motion and constant contact, diffracted across time and oceans.

THE STRANGE LOVE STORIES OF OGDEN WHITNEY (New York Review Comics, 112 pp., $19.95), edited by the comics aficionado Dan Nadel and the cartoonist Frank Santoro (“Pittsburgh”). As detailed in Nadel’s afterword, Whitney was born in 1918, illustrated and invented assorted superheroes (including the Flash and his own, absurd Herbie Popnecker) in his 20s, and served in the Army during World War II. He found later happiness in his 1958 marriage, presumably inspiring the delirious, daftly satisfying romance comics of the early 1960s. Anne Whitney’s death in 1970 precipitated his end: He died five years later in a psychiatric hospital in the Bronx. (Nadel also supplies this bit of dope: The “Watchmen” creator Alan Moore’s 2016 novel “Jerusalem” depicts Whitney meeting James Joyce’s schizophrenic daughter, Lucia, in the asylum.)"

Settled into the hollowed ground beneath the dome, the interiors were cool and dim, a reprieve from the forest’s hostility. “These shelters don’t get recognition for being ‘green’ or ‘eco-friendly,’” says the 50-year-old architect José Cubilla, who’s based in Asunción, Paraguay’s capital, a slow-paced riverside city built at the point where the Chaco in the west meets the iridescent meadows and forests that unfurl across the country’s east. “But this is what interests me: obvious things, obvious solutions, simple materials.”"

Earrings That Flicker With Balletic Grace,2020-02-18,article,News,,"['Dancing', 'Jewels and Jewelry']","From Van Cleef & Arpels, jewel-and-pearl pieces that all but dance on the ear.","When the choreographer George Balanchine debuted “Jewels” in 1967 at the New York City Ballet’s new home at Lincoln Center, it was considered the first full-evening abstract ballet. Cynics speculated that, with sparkly costumes and three acts titled “Emeralds,” “Rubies” and “Diamonds,” he was trying to attract a glitzier crowd for the relatively proletarian dance company. But he insisted his inspiration came from the gems in the Fifth Avenue windows of Van Cleef & Arpels, the Parisian jeweler run by Claude Arpels. Claude’s uncle, Louis, had been the first Arpels to recognize the elegant symbiosis between gems and the ballet, commissioning the now 124-year-old maison’s signature ballerina clips in the 1940s. Van Cleef & Arpels has continued to reference dance throughout its history, most recently with these earrings made in the dangling rounded-pendant balletti style, inspired by the jewel-toned ball gowns worn by women during the Italian Renaissance. While both pairs feature diamonds and pearls, one suggests spring, with a confection of rubies and pink sapphires, and the other gestures toward fall, with emeralds, yellow sapphires and black spinels. Both dance and spin weightlessly in the light, alive with effervescent grace. Price on request, vancleefarpels.com."

What happened is simple enough: In the Minnesota woods in the summer of 1861, Lindbergh’s grandfather, a recent immigrant from Sweden, got his arm caught in a sawmill. The wound was horrific; the man’s beating heart was visible through the hole in his side. He was expected to die. But he refused. By sheer force of will, according to family lore, he was soon out of bed and back to work."

The speech, barely more than 700 words, is now considered one of the most important in American history. But on the day it was delivered, March 4, 1865, with the Union on the brink of victory in the Civil War, Lincoln had trouble placating his own party, much less his political opponents. And he opted to write words that addressed slavery in grand, religious terms, rather than itemizing the practical ways in which the country would have to begin moving forward. In “Every Drop of Blood,” Edward Achorn addresses sweeping issues about the war and the precarious state of the nation by narrowing his lens to the 24 hours around the inauguration and the many notable characters around the president that day. Below, Achorn discusses the hostility toward the president, the diaries of Southern women, how Stanley Kubrick is like Lincoln and more."

Often the pair achieves this sort of tension by balancing the conceptual with the casual. It’s no surprise, then, that when they did decide to collaborate, it was with Birkenstock, the nearly 250-year-old German shoe company whose legions of fans include many a fashion person, perhaps because the iconic chunky sandals can always be relied upon to offset a look that threatens to come off as too dressed."

How to Serve Fonio,2020-02-24,article,News,,"['Grain', 'Cooking and Cookbooks']",A cookbook from the chef Pierre Thiam offers a guide to making this African grain.,"Is fonio the new quinoa? This African grain, native to the regions just south of the Sahara, has been given that label. It has a lot going for it, as Pierre Thiam, a New York chef from Senegal, explains in his elegant cookbook. Fonio is easy and fast to grow. It’s also drought-resistant, nutritious, gluten-free and better for the soil than the commodity crops like corn, wheat, soy and rice that have become Africa’s agricultural staples. Once fonio is winnowed and dried, the tiny grains (much smaller than quinoa) can be steamed and used in various ways. (Care must be taken so it doesn’t clump and get gummy, and reheating can be tricky.) The book concentrates on traditional African dishes, with ingredients like cassava, okra, baobab leaf and red palm oil. But for wider appeal, like that of quinoa, it needs more recipes like his excellent roasted salmon with cheesy fonio grits. For me, fonio is more like polenta or cream of wheat than quinoa.

By 16, Sialelli was interning at Opéra de Marseille’s costume department, where he worked alongside members of the fashion designer Christian Lacroix’s team.
