"Sports: Bill Walton’s ‘Back From the Dead,’ and More",2016-06-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Bill Walton’s elegiac yet exuberant new memoir, an investigation of arm injuries in baseball and more.","The current edition of David Halberstam’s classic “The Breaks of the Game” features a glaring error, right on the back cover. It promises an account of “the tumultuous 1979-80 season for the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers.” There’s no denying the season was tumultuous. The team was not, however, Bill Walton-led. Frustrated with the Blazers’ handling of his ailing feet, the star center had defected to the San Diego Clippers before the season began."
"Horror: Joyce Carol Oates’s ‘The Doll-Master and Other Tales of Terror,’ and More",2016-06-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"New books from Joyce Carol Oates, Peter Straub, Victor LaValle and others show us where the genre is going and where it’s been.","Fifty years and millions of words ago, when Joyce Carol Oates was in her late 20s, she wrote a story about an unhappy teenager named Connie who accepts a ride, unwisely, from a dark, glib young man who calls himself Arnold Friend, and although that story, “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?,” is scrupulously realistic, it is also a classic tale of horror. It is, in its chillingly objective way, scarier than anything in Oates’s new collection, THE DOLL-MASTER AND OTHER TALES OF TERROR (Mysterious Press, $24) — which, as it happens, contains a story about another teenage girl who gets in the wrong car. The smooth-talking male predator in this new one, “Big Momma,” keeps a very large metaphor as a house pet: the title character is a 20-foot-long reticulated python. There’s nothing of the supernatural in either story, or for that matter in any of the “tales of terror” in the present collection, but Oates’s brand of horror has never required the invocation of other worlds: This world is terrible enough for her. Everything she writes, in whatever genre, has an air of dread, because she deals in vulnerabilities and inevitabilities, in the desperate needs that drive people like Connie and poor young Violet of “Big Momma” to their fates. A sense of helplessness is the essence of horror, and Oates conveys that feeling as well as any writer around, whether the powerlessness in question is that of a victim or, as in the title story of “The Doll-Master,” that of someone who is unable to stop doing harm to others: Obsession can be a kind of vulnerability, too."

"‘Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’ All-Time Greatest Hits,’ by Mark Binelli",2016-06-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Mark Binelli imagines his way into the life of a rock star who toyed with notions of blackness and theatricality.,"I first read the name Screamin’ Jay Hawkins in late March 1997, with the posthumous release of the Notorious B.I.G.’s album “Life After Death.” The album cover showed Biggie in black hat and black coat with his back up against a black hearse, “B.I.G.” on the license plate. One of its tracks, “Kick in the Door,” sampled the song “I Put a Spell on You.” I already knew (and loved) the Nina Simone version, but until then I had no idea she was covering Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’s only hit record. “I Put a Spell on You” is lyrically dark, the offbeat tale of a heartbroken lover (or obsessive stalker, depending on your point of view) who resorts to magic to get his partner back. The song, like Screamin’ Jay Hawkins and also strangely like Biggie himself, at once defied and cradled conventional understandings of comedy, tragedy, “authentic” black male voice and “authentic” black male performance."

I imagine because it’s functional and people sometimes don’t like to see the value in something you can use as much as something you can put on a wall,” says Catherine Lock, co-founder of the New Craftsmen, a unique space in London dedicated to selling and promoting the work of small-scale British artisans. “I see craft as art we can live with in a real way.” After working as a product developer at the popular English home décor chain Habitat and for the British Council promoting local designers of all sorts at home and abroad, Lock spotted a gap in the market for a business that sold handmade works such as ceramics and textiles in the elevated, curated manner of an art gallery. In 2012, the then-39-year-old toured the U.K. for five months searching every remote corner of the country for hidden talent — a pair of potters from the isolated wilds of Wales, a furniture maker from the misty forests of Kent, a textile designer working in the smallest of studios in East London — to sell in a temporary space she secured in London’s Mayfair neighborhood. “I went where the wind took me. One artist would tell me about another,” says Lock. “I was hunting for objects but it also ended up being a journey into my own culture. What I’m doing is as much about what goes on our shelves as the stories of the people making these wonderful things.”"

The former officer, Nouman Raja, was arrested and charged with attempted murder and manslaughter in the Oct. 18 death of Corey Jones, 31, after a grand jury found the shooting was unjustified, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said. Mr. Jones’s sport utility vehicle had broken down on a highway ramp. He had gotten out and was on the phone with roadside assistance when Mr. Raja, who is of South Asian descent, pulled up in an unmarked van. The men’s exchange was captured on the call center recording. “At no time during the recording did Raja say he was a police officer,” the affidavit said. “Instead, Raja replied by asking the single word ‘Really?’ when Jones twice said, ‘I’m good.’ ” Both men apparently pulled guns. Mr. Raja, 38, fired six shots, hitting Mr. Jones three times. Mr. Jones never fired. (AP)"

Five Super-Simple Swimsuit Brands to Know,2016-06-02,article,News,,"['Bathing Suits and Swimwear', 'Swimming']","Just in time for summer, a guide to fuss-free bathing suits to last this season — and beyond.","Since launching her eponymous line in 2012, the designer Shaina Mote has won die-hard fans, who rely on the Los Angeles-based label for its versatile, elevated basics. Those fans, however, have had to fend for themselves in the swimwear category — until now. Today, Mote launches a capsule line of swimwear that stays true to the distinctive, functional aesthetic she’s perfected in her main line. The expansion was borne out of Mote’s struggle to find a suit that fit into her own life: “I felt there was a little bit of a void for a type of swimwear that can be used in an active environment as well as one that’s leisurely,” she says. To fulfill that mandate, Mote created a six-piece collection, which was inspired by the clean lines found in the work of the Mexican architect Luis Barragán. One innovation she struck upon: She eliminated the top stitch typically found on swimsuits, so that each style would “mesh into the body, and lie more flush with the skin.” With so much attention paid to the fit and cut, it’s no wonder Mote decided to keep the color palette as simple as possible. Every piece in the line, which has been crafted from dead-stock Italian fabric, is black. “I wanted to make sure I was presenting the customer with something that was really accessible and travels well,” she says. “Since this is my first swimwear collection, I really wanted to nail down those basics and core styles.”"

Inside the List,2016-06-10,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Noah Hawley, whose thriller “Before the Fall” is No. 2 on the hardcover fiction list, says “Our news now comes prefiltered for ‘meaning.’ ”","Bad News: On the surface, Noah Hawley’s novel “Before the Fall” — new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 2 — is a standard thriller: It opens with the crash of a private jet off Martha’s Vineyard, then backs up to examine the lives of the passengers in an effort to figure out what went wrong. Dig a little deeper, though, and the book turns out to contain an unexpected strand of media criticism. David Bateman, who hired the jet, runs a television station very like Fox News, and one of the novel’s main story lines involves the efforts of his channel’s populist blowhard anchor to demonize a survivor. “It’s definitely a look at the dangers of personality-driven media,” Hawley told USA Today last month. “We have these personas like O’Reilly or Chris Matthews or Megyn Kelly, the people who in some ways become the story as well.” But Hawley (who, as the showrunner for “Fargo” on FX, works in the same Rupert Murdoch-owned universe as Fox News) emphasized that he had no particular models in mind. “My job as a novelist isn’t to draw a thinly veiled version of real people and institutions,” he told me via email. “It is to try to find the truth of a thing by recreating it in a different form.” In this case, he added, the goal was to point out the danger of leaping to conclusions based on limited facts: “What happened? What does it mean? These are different questions. Historically the news media’s role was to answer the first and leave the second to informed viewers. But somewhere around the turn of the century a shift occurred. Our news now comes prefiltered for ‘meaning,’ the ‘relevant’ facts arranged to fit a certain worldview — conservative, liberal — and then delivered as if they were objective truth. Facts that don’t fit that worldview are left out. As a result, conservative people live in a different America than liberal people. Not only can we no longer agree on the meaning of events. We literally can’t agree on the events themselves.”"

One Man’s Quest to Get Americans to Care About Rugby,2016-06-17,article,News,,"['Rugby', 'Olympic Games (2016)']","In the U.S., the sport has long been overshadowed by football. Now a former bond trader is working to bring it back to the mainstream.","He was hard-pressed to explain it even to himself. Possibly the whole idea was daft. His “rugby dream,” the aspiration to start a professional rugby league in North America, had taken over his life. It had him raiding his bank account to pay for logos, trademarks, websites. For visa specialists, branding wizards, a high-powered sports lawyer. It had him hacking through jungles of marketing jargon. His Midtown Manhattan office was cluttered with cartons of new business cards, boxes of hats, sample jerseys. There was a litter of unorganized receipts on the desk. In 18 months he’d racked up 250,000 frequent flier miles. He’d watched the Rugby World Cup in London from the Royal Box at Olympic Stadium; someone joked he could plunge New Zealand into a national depression if he lured their stars to America. He’d delved into venue contracts, hot-dog sales projections and turf heights on rugby-compliant fields. In conversation after conversation, on the phone, by email and in person, at mixers and conferences, in airports and foyers and hallways, he pitched his plans, parried critics and cajoled skeptics into the fold. Some guardians of amateur rugby were threatened by the prospect of losing prized club players to a pro league. Some just wondered who the hell he was — Douglas Schoninger, a not-particularly-athletic 55-year-old former bond trader who had never played rugby, who dimly remembered seeing a few games 30 or 40 years ago but didn’t know a ruck from a maul or a lock from a hooker until he bought a copy of “Rugby Union for Dummies.”"

Kaur is a 23-year-old social media phenom from Toronto who gained attention last year when she fought Instagram’s removal of a photo she posted showing menstrual blood. As her audience grew — she now has 475,000 followers on Instagram and 34,500 on Twitter — Kaur earned a reputation not only for her photos and ­sketches but also for brief, plain-­spoken ­poems tackling feminism, love, trauma and healing in short lines that can be as smooth as pop music (“love will hold you / love will call your name”) or as jagged as rusty metal (“the hurt / the loss / the pain / the breaking”). Much of Kaur’s appeal comes from this artless vulnerability, like a cross between Charles Bukowski and Cat Power, and from an ingénue’s willingness to blurt out whatever is on her mind. “I was always writing for myself,” she told The Times of India this month. “I wrote what I needed to write and hear — that’s what makes it powerful. And it’s this honesty that has got me where I am today.” Well, that and some serious marketing savvy: Besides “Milk and Honey,” which she initially self-­published, visitors to Kaur’s website can also buy jars of artisanal honey branded with her name, “from the hives of distinguished queen bees.” And she has ideas about how to expand her reach. “There have been articles saying that all women need to read my book,” she told The Times of India. “I ask, why not all men? In fact, that would be even more valuable because we women want to sit down with men and tell them — this is how we feel, this is what we go through.”"
Review: Salt & Barrel Oyster and Craft Cocktail Bar in Bay Shore,2016-06-17,article,News,,['Restaurants'],"The family behind the well-known seafood restaurant Flynn’s Fire Island, a mainstay in Ocean Bay Park since 1937, brings a more upscale option to the shore.","Say “seafood restaurant” and many Long Islanders will think of Flynn’s Fire Island, a mainstay in Ocean Bay Park since 1937. About three months ago, the Flynn family opened a very different spot in Bay Shore. Salt & Barrel Oyster and Craft Cocktail Bar is not a rustic, by-the-water, keep-it-casual place like Flynn’s. It is much more upscale, has a New American, seafood-based menu, and is within a brand-new apartment complex on West Main Street."

The country was lifting itself out of the Great Depression, helped by the policies of Franklin Roosevelt, but the climb back to prosperity was long and slow, and a mood of populist unrest began to steal across the land. “The followers of the demagogues mostly came from the old lower-middle classes, now in an unprecedented stage of frustration and fear, menaced by humiliation, dispossession and poverty,” Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote in “The Politics of Upheaval,” published in 1960. “They came from provincial and traditionally nonpolitical groups in the population, jolted from apathy into near-hysteria by the shock of economic collapse.” Many also “came from the evangelical denominations; years of Bible reading and fundamentalist revivalism had accustomed them to millennial solutions.” Outsider candidates became the vehicles of an existential protest, “Old America in resentful revolt against both contemporary politics and contemporary economics.”"

Inside the List,2016-06-24,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Bobby Brown’s memoir, at No. 9 on the hardcover nonfiction list, is filled with sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll. And dance moves: “Break dancing, pop locking — man, I was unbelievable.”","Man in Motion: The singer Bobby Brown has a memoir on this week’s ­hardcover nonfiction list — “Every Little Step,” co-written with Nick Chiles, debuts at No. 9. Brown rose to fame with New Edition in the 1980s before drug problems and a turbulent marriage to Whitney Houston made him a mainstay of police blotters, cementing his tabloid reputation as “the bad boy of R&B.” Those days are behind him now, according to the memoir, but Brown is still willing to share the wild details. Among frank ­passages about liaisons with Madonna, Janet Jackson and an entertainer at his bachelor party (“Let me say the night with the midget blew my mind”), Brown casually announces he’s also had a close encounter of the paranormal kind: “One memorable night, one of the ghosts ­descended from the ceiling and had sex with me. . . . And let me add this: This was before I ever touched any drug besides weed and alcohol.” The book isn’t all sex and drugs, though. There’s plenty of rock ’n’ roll, too. “My God, funk was everything to me,” Brown says of his listening habits when he was growing up in Boston. “When I put on the funk, I’d start the dancing.” He adds that, in the rough projects where he lived, his sense of rhythm offered him a kind of protection. “Although violence was always around us, one of the main ways I battled back then was not with my fists — it was with my dance moves. I wasn’t necessarily confident about my singing yet, but I knew I could whup anybody’s ass in a dance battle. . . . Break dancing, pop locking — man, I was unbelievable.”"

An ominous lit sign reading “FOXP2,” the name of the show, marks the entryway into the surgery-bright antechamber that the 29-year-old artist describes as her “biological showroom.” Inspired by car fairs and grocery stores, the extreme environment sets the tone for Humeau’s fourth-ever solo show, spurred by her interest in what she calls “luminous horror.” “It’s trying to create things that at first look very bright and attractive, but are actually horrific. Luminosity is something I think of when looking at the Apple store; they sell light,” Humeau says. “To me, it’s the same premise that many religions have sold: to become immortal, you have to become immaterial.”"
"From Brexit to Climate, Little Engagement From Young People",2016-06-24,article,News,,"['Great Britain Withdrawal from EU (Brexit)', 'Referendums', 'Voting and Voters', 'Youth']","Britain’s “Brexit” vote was likely tipped by disengagement among young voters for whom the consequences matter most.

I’ve frequently pointed out the great work of what I once called “Generation E” — young people working energetically to foster social and environmental progress.

The pound continued to slide before steadying later in the day.Market sentiment was improved by assurances of support from central banks, but uncertainty meant that haven assets like gold and the yen continued to advance.European Union leaders are gathered for the second day of a summit meeting in Brussels to discuss Britain’s withdrawal and leaders were keen on Tuesday to make sure that Britain and any others tempted to follow in its path knew that leaving would carry a heavy price, as Andrew Higgins and James Kanter report in The New York Times.Shares in banks like Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Barclays recovered some ground on Tuesday, but fears about their ability to sell billions of dollars of derivatives, securitized mortgages and other hard-to-value and sell securities have not waned, Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook.One of the best ways to assess a bank’s broad risk profile is to look at its exposure to Level 3 securities, which are so opaque and complex they trade rarely, if at all. Risk managers have to literally guess how much a Level 3 asset is worth.According to their annual reports in 2015, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are sitting on the largest piles of Level 3 assets. Reflecting investor concern about the risky assets they own, these three banks trade at a steep discount to their book value. And there are few signs that the selling will let up, as hedge funds have increased their bets against European banks.Concern about Britain’s future in Europe and its place as a financial hub has made it even harder to offload these securities.” All this Brexit uncertainty is drying up the markets,” Jan Riepe, a finance professor at the University of Tübingen, said. “And because many of these assets are traded over the counter in London, it is even more difficult to value them. It’s very dangerous for the banks.”Credit default swaps tied to the creditworthiness of European banks do provide some reassurance, Peter Eavis writes in The Upshot. The cost of insuring against defaults by large banks is still far lower than it was during the financial crisis and when European debt markets were plunging. Of course, the cost of the swaps is still much higher than the was the day before the referendum.But it is not Europe’s Lehman Brothers moment, Neil Irwin writes in The Upshot. After Lehman’s bankruptcy, banks hoarded cash and became reluctant to lend to anyone. There are few signs of that happening in response to Britain’s vote to leave the bloc.The premium that banks charge to lend to one another rose much more after Lehman’s collapse than it has done in Britain since last week. Banks still face huge costs as they consider whether to relocate from London to Europe, but it appears that investors still believe that they will weather the storm.In the United States, the Federal Reserve will tell the nation’s largest banks on Wednesday whether they passed or failed their annual stress tests. All banks proved their resilience in the first round of results, Gina Chon writes in Breakingviews.And as lenders have become better at passing these exams, their payouts have improved. They may be able to continue that this year, but not as much as might be suggested by improved economic conditions, Ms. Chon writes. Britain’s looming exit from the European Union adds another layer of caution."

"‘Alpha, Bravo, Charlie’ and ‘Daytime Visions’",2016-06-29,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Two new alphabet books are examples of a thriving and increasingly sophisticated genre.,"At a moment when communication seems to have been taken over by all things digital, alphabet books are holding strong. In fact they just keep getting more sophisticated. Sara Gillingham’s “Alpha, Bravo, Charlie,” to take one innovative example, packs quite a pleasurable wallop. It’s a big, well-organized compendium of how messages are sent and received at sea, working through the phonetic alphabet — the Alpha, Bravo, Charlie system of the title — as well as Morse code, signal flags, and the extremely old-school semaphore system, in which letters are represented by a person holding two flags in specific positions. Each page contains a wealth of clearly explained information that ties together all the nautical communication systems, adding for good measure other useful maritime facts. The page for “I,” for example, shows the flag “India,” which means “I am turning left.” We also learn that boats can use Morse code to send the same message by giving two blasts, and we get a trick for remembering left (port) from right (starboard): “A ship that is sailing out to the ocean has ‘left port.’ ”"

Ms. Barr, of course, starred in the groundbreaking, Emmy-winning sitcom “Roseanne” (1988-1997), one of the first network shows to include gay characters and offer a comparatively realistic depiction of a working-class family.

This no-frills horror film about a murderous psycho who terrorizes people unlucky enough to wander into his corner of California hill country has no fancy special effects or supernatural goings-on. Its dialogue would probably fit on a couple of sheets of paper. But it sure is creepy, in a throwback sort of way."

The company is playing Alexei Ratmansky’s production of “The Sleeping Beauty,” new last year; the choreography, to a large extent, is not Mr. Ratmansky’s but by Marius Petipa, restored from records of the 1890 original and with a startling command of period style.

It’s no wonder that so many journalists love playing make-believe producers, as when they write that the news they’re covering “has all the makings of a Hollywood movie.” These days, though, the major American movie studios are more in the business of comic-book intrigues than in realism. Even so, the continued trickle of adaptations of John le Carré’s work (including the recent miniseries “The Night Manager”) suggests that someone still believes that there’s a market for adult stories about real-world stakes."
