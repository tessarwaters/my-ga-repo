From the hallucinogenic vision of “The Farm” in the 1920s to his mural-scale fields of color punctuated by wispy signs in the 1960s, evidence of worldly political engagement is hard to find. A reluctant joiner and manifesto signer, Miró (1893-1983) disliked Social Realism. The artists of the past who inspired him were mystic visionaries like Hieronymus Bosch and William Blake."

Next up: “Belief+Doubt,” a site-specific installation by the artist Barbara Kruger. Even as it’s tucked into the museum’s lower lobby, the piece, which will be unveiled on Aug. 20 and remain up through 2014, will be impossible to miss: 6,700 square feet of text-printed vinyl in Kruger’s signature palette of red, white and black will occupy the walls, the escalators, even the floors of this highly trafficked public space, confronting visitors with questions (“Who Is Free to Choose? Who Prays Loudest?”) and declarations (“Plenty Should Be Enough”), forcing them to reexamine their faith in the democratic process — or their need to purchase a souvenir in the museum’s newly renovated bookstore."

Bobos in Paradise,2012-08-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Karl Taro Greenfeld’s novel observes the details of downtown life, circa 2008.","One view of the novel, the one that E. M. Forster advanced, says it’s “a fiction in prose of a certain extent” — meaning more than 50,000 words, in Forster’s opinion. By that definition Karl Taro Greenfeld’s “Triburbia” qualifies as a novel, which is what his publisher calls it, though I’d be inclined to call it linked stories. I suspect that if “Dubliners” had been published in recent years it would have been marketed as a novel. If Tom Rachman’s “Imperfectionists” and Jennifer Egan’s “Visit From the Goon Squad” are novels, if Flann O’Brien’s “At Swim-Two-Birds” is a novel, then so, perhaps, is “Triburbia.” It lacks the sense of closure and the linear narrative drive of more conventional examples of the form, but it’s an artful and casually cohesive work of fiction imbued with anthropological insight."

Centering on unmoored young men and women taking fraught voyages of self-discovery, Brandon’s first two novels — “Arkansas” and “Citrus County” — shuddered through strip-mall landscapes leafy with damaged adults, broken families, disintegrating plans and unrealized hopes. “Citrus County” was about the tentative love between a middle schoolboy and the girl whose younger sister that boy had kidnapped; its every page was bright with the detailed observations, aesthetic vision and moral complexities we look for in the big leagues of serious literature. Thus, like Salinger before him and contemporaries including Hannah Tinti, Tony Earley and Mark Haddon, Brandon is an author who expands the tent, delivering capital-letter good stuff to young readers and adults alike."

In a recent e-mail, he said of Obama: “If I could tell him just one thing, it would be to remind him that each of the last three presidents could have gone to jail in their youth for doing drugs that other Americans are still being punished for. Just getting caught smoking pot once can follow you around for the rest of your life, blocking career and even housing opportunities.

She then magnified and printed a total of five pictures onto large canvases that underwent a 72-hour Mark Rothko-like top coat of paint, to mimic the fossils’ reflective and translucent textures. “The human eye doesn’t necessarily recognize the natural beauty of the fossils within jewelry’s small scale,” Péan says. “There are many people that see different patterns in the paintings, and make guesses, like, ‘Are they bursts of sun?’ But once I show them the actual jewelry pieces, they completely understand.”"

United States, which for a time in the 1950s and 1960s was the fastest and most advanced ocean liner ever built. It was the lifelong project of William Francis Gibbs, America’s preeminent naval architect, a self-taught engineer who, among his many other achievements, was instrumental in transforming a German liner captured during World War I into the Leviathan, the pride of America’s postwar passenger fleet. Then, during World War II, he pioneered a revolutionary process to construct the so-called Liberty Ships, which became symbols of America’s industrial might. All along, Gibbs nursed plans to build a revolutionary superliner. But his designs, hatched in his parents’ Philadelphia attic as early 1916, were not realized until 1952. Ten years after its christening, his transatlantic ship would prowl the icy North Atlantic as a kind of floating anachronism, jet planes having turned its record three-day, 10-hour crossing time into a sorry joke.

Blockbusters Yield to Magic,2012-08-08,article,News,,['Movies'],"Heroic blockbusters like “Marvel’s the Avengers” and “The Dark Knight Rises” are draws this summer, but so are smaller films like “Moonrise Kingdom” and “Magic Mike.”","WHEN “Jaws” landed in June 1975, it thrilled so many moviegoers week after hot sticky week that within months it had made box office history. As the critic Tom Shone put it in his book “Blockbuster,” “That’s what America did in the summer of 1975: It watched ‘Jaws.’ ” These days, though, Americans are rarely unified by one must-see movie for long, even when school’s out. When “Marvel’s The Avengers” opened in May, it topped the box office for three weeks until it was toppled by “Men in Black 3,” which held the top spot for two, until it was bested by “Snow White and the Huntsman,” which held on for one. And so it goes as each studio behemoth is bumped by the next in what has become a faster cycle of planned obsolescence."

Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer poisoned in London in 2006 with a rare radioactive isotope, polonium 210. The case soured relations between Britain and Russia, and the new development may put at risk recent improvements.

The hearings to be overseen by the judge, Sir Robert Owen, could provide the first opportunity in the case for witnesses to testify under oath. A procedural hearing is to be held next month. British prosecutors have accused another former K.G.B. officer, Andrei K. Lugovoi, of Mr. Litvinenko’s poisoning — a charge he denies — and are seeking his extradition, which Russia has refused. Mr. Litvinenko, who fled Russia in 2000, had secured British citizenship shortly before he died, and he accused Russia’s leader, Vladimir V. Putin, of responsibility for his poisoning. "

Most recently she’s designed a 10-piece collection of handbags in collaboration with the British heritage brand Asprey (prices starting at $1,200). “I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel,” says Hillier, who studied up on Asprey classics like the Belgravia Darcy bag and the Mayfair clutch before putting pen to paper on the designs. “There are so many wonderful Asprey bags that are just perfect as they are,” she explains. So instead of updating or reinterpreting those, Hillier turned to archival gentlemen’s document holders for inspiration. Warm, sybaritic shades of sapphire, hazel and shiny licorice make the bags feel especially luxurious and modern. “For the palette I was very inspired by a walk through the woods in autumn,” Hillier says. A standout: this accordion clutch in bramble crocodile, part of the Wiltshire group that also features shoulder bags in skins like ostrich and python."

Wilson wrote of the contrast between East and West, and of feeling compelled to keep her religious beliefs secret. “In the West,” she observed, “anything that must be hidden is suspect; availability and honesty are interlinked.

According to this narrative, covert jihadis are working to usurp the law of the land and replace it with Islamic rule. A caliphate will rise on the ashes of the Constitution, Americans will be forced to pray in mosques and judges will mete out stonings and amputations. “Stealth jihadis use political, cultural, societal, religious, intellectual tools; violent jihadis use violence,” Newt Gingrich told the American Enterprise Institute in July 2010. “But in fact they’re both engaged in jihad, and they’re both seeking to impose the same end state, which is to replace Western civilization with a radical imposition of Shariah.” During the Republican presidential primaries, every candidate weighed in on the Shariah threat. In November 2010, Oklahoma voters approved a constitutional amendment banning the use of Islamic law in court. A federal appeals court blocked the amendment, but more than two dozen other states have considered legislation to restrict judges from consulting foreign and religious laws."

On the surface, the agreement has had little effect on the N.B.A. since its introduction last year. Players are still receiving lucrative multiyear contracts and owners have shown little restraint in offering similar deals to even the lesser tier of players. Yet the entire market for players has rotated, quietly altering its dynamic. The more things change, after all, the more they superficially appear to stay the same."

Inside the List,2012-08-10,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],M. L. Stedman — whose novel “The Light Between Oceans” enters the list at No. 7 — really doesn’t like publicity.,"DARKNESS AND LIGHT: Some writers crave publicity, while the very hint of it makes others curl into a defensive ball like hedgehogs or pill bugs. M. L. Stedman — whose new novel, “The Light Between Oceans,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 7 — is a hedgehog. The book carries no author photograph, and only a brusque biography: “M. L. Stedman was born and raised in Western Australia and now lives in London. ‘The Light Between Oceans’ is her first novel. Go away.” (O.K., so I added the last sentence myself.) Stedman has mostly shunned press interviews as well — but not entirely, and because this is the age of the Internet it’s possible for a determined reader to track down a couple of profiles that ran in her native Australia this spring. They are, refreshingly, less about her personality than her novel, the story of a World War I veteran who moves with his wife to a remote island for work as a lighthouse keeper. “There is something that appeals to the human psyche about lighthouses because of their isolation,” Stedman told The Sydney Morning Herald in March. “Their presence offers up a marvelous set of dichotomies the human imagination likes to explore — darkness and light, safety and danger, stasis and movement, isolation and communication. The story throws up the role of isolation on morality — when you don’t see the impact of your actions. Perhaps it’s easier to fool yourself when you cannot see the face of those who are affected by what you do.” The article does offer a few glimpses of the private Stedman (the “M” stands for Margot, and she has worked as a lawyer), but for the most part she stands her ground with admirably Pynchonian resolve. “Details of my life won’t really shed light on the story,” she said. “I’d much rather let readers focus on the book and their own experience of it.”"

Ryan of Wisconsin over the weekend to be his running mate is being credited with shoring up Mr. Romney’s conservative bona fides — something his campaign would have known because conservative publications had been telling him through editorials that he should pick Mr. Ryan to shore up his conservative bona fides. The Weekly Standard and The Wall Street Journal both wrote editorials promoting Mr. Ryan for the Republican ticket: The Journal’s editorial on Thursday (Why Not Paul Ryan?) and The Weekly Standard’s editorial dated Monday but online earlier (Go for the Gold, Mitt!). Perhaps this is the reason, Michael Barbaro writes, that Mr. Romney’s camp was eager to announce the day he made the decision, Aug. 1: “Mr. Romney is sensitive to the perception that he acts at the behest of the party’s right wing. Now, he is making the case that he had settled on Mr. Ryan well before a chorus of conservatives told him to.”"

Glow With the Flow,2012-08-13,article,News,,[],"The latest detox craze, External Counter Pulsation therapy, is being offered as a multipurpose remedy for everything from fatigue to weight gain.","First there was the raw food movement. Then came macrobiotics, followed by the all-mighty juice cleanse. The latest detox craze isn’t something you can ingest, but it has plenty of people drinking the proverbial Kool-Aid. A cardiovascular procedure called External Counter Pulsation therapy, cleared by the F.D.A. in 1987 for the treatment of angina, claims to stimulate and clear collaterals (small blood vessels) to bypass narrow or clogged arteries. During the procedure, a patient’s legs are strapped to an adjustable bed using pressurized cuffs hooked up to a heart monitor. The cuffs inflate and deflate in sync with the heartbeat, pumping blood upward, so it can oxygenate more rapidly and distribute with greater ease. Now rebranded as Pure Flow Pulsation at New York’s PureFlow, E.C.P. is being offered, under the guidance of the cardiologist Dr. Samir Shah, as a multipurpose remedy for everything from fatigue to weight gain. (Andrew Barile, PureFlow’s co-founder, says that a 45-minute session is the aerobic equivalent of a seven-and-a-half-mile walk.) Some New Yorkers are swearing by it. “At first I wasn’t convinced, but by the third session I noticed that, for the first time in 20 years, I was able to enjoy a full night’s sleep without interruption,” says Celeste Fierro, a restaurant and nightclub consultant. Her tolerance for alcohol is lower, too. “I used to be able to drink a bottle of wine at dinner, and now I can only take a glass.” And for the Tom Ford stylist Sabrina Baldieri, the results are outwardly apparent, too. “I have more control over my weight,” she says. “It also gives me immediate relief from jet lag and an overall glow.”"

A rose-colored, wistful affection for the city is shared by the group’s three members — Cummings, Noah Rubin (drums) and Joshua Hubbard (guitar) — and can be heard loud and clear in songs like “Good Weird Woman,” with its subway-station-sounding saxophone, and “Are We Just Doomed?” a bittersweet account of leaving home and hardly sleeping, something any New York band worth its salt knows intimately. “I couldn’t imagine making or listening to this music in any other environment,” Cummings says. And even without the skateboards or skills, Skaters do look the part. Dressed in the British men’s-wear label Folk, as they were for their T photo shoot, there’s no covering up their romantically ragged edges."

Master of a Shrinking Universe,2012-08-16,article,Review,,['Movies'],"“Cosmopolis,” directed by David Cronenberg and based on a novel by Don DeLillo, follows a young man with plenty of money.","The first image in David Cronenberg’s “Cosmopolis,” a cold, funny number about the erotics of money and the seduction of death, is that of a chrome grille on a white stretch limousine. The shot is a close-up that’s so tightly framed that the grille, with its U shape and vertical bars, looks as if it were smiling. It also looks like a shark, a perfect starting point for a story about a master of the universe who, over one long day and night, lives, eats, evacuates and fornicates in the limo. A master who, like some kind of millennial Jonah, has taken up residence in the belly of a new beast."

In “Robot & Frank,” an eager-to-please story set in the near future about an elderly gent, his robot and some awkwardly managed truths about old age, Frank Langella plays so many variations on cute and crotchety and with such suppleness — he’s by turns a charming codger, a silver fox and a wise graybeard — that his performance comes close to a saving grace.

Kerr Goes Kiwi,2012-08-17,article,News,,['Models (Professional)'],"To cap off an extended stay in New Zealand with her family, Miranda Kerr gives Wellington a whirl in fall’s white shirts and strappy flats. And this time her movie-star husband is behind the camera.","Miranda Kerr was 18, just out of high school, a girl from the Australian countryside curious about what the rest of the world had to offer, when she first visited New Zealand. Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn’t know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. “Still, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,” Kerr recently reflected. “Ever since, I’ve wanted to get back to New Zealand.”"

The former enjoys the complacency of the au courant and the lassitude of at-hand language, while the latter believes with Thoreau that “this world is but canvas to our imaginations,” that the only worthy assertion of imagination occurs by way of linguistic originality wed to intellect and emotional verity. You close “Don Quixote” and “Tristram Shandy,” “Middlemarch” and “Augie March,” and the cosmos takes on a coruscated import it rather lacked before, an “eternal and irrepressible freshness,” in Pound’s apt phrase. His definition of literature is among the best we have: “Language charged with meaning.” How charged was the last novel you read?"

Kirby Shakespeare Theater at Drew University in Madison, N.J.","Isabella’s quandary in the Shakespeare play “Measure for Measure” is a little like Joan’s in the 2012 season of “Mad Men.” Should a woman sleep with a man she finds repellent if by doing so she serves a greater good? And how much greater does that good have to be? On “Mad Men,” it was a matter of crass commerce, an advertising agency getting its first big auto account. In “Measure for Measure,” it is a question of the woman’s saving her brother from execution. But this story being a product of Elizabethan England, when notions of immortal damnation were taken more personally, the playwright cannot let her fall into bed with just anybody. He cannot let her fall into bed at all."

But interestingly, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, shoppers are not likely to see higher prices for corn on the cob because sweet corn is not as vulnerable to drought conditions. Corn on the cob that is sold in supermarkets is an irrigated crop, like other vegetables and fruits grown on large farms. However, smaller farms that sell their produce at farmers’ markets in drought-stricken areas are having a difficult time with their yields, so you may see a spike in prices there. The season for good, fresh sweet corn is such a short one that I will pay the price for it, just as I’ll spend money on heirloom tomatoes."

And its developer, Andrew Zobler, the C.E.O. of Sydell Group (which owns the NoMad Hotel and brought the Ace Hotels to New York and Palm Springs), is betting that it’s a game changer in the hospitality business. He hired Roman & Williams, which designed the Ace New York, to create the interiors — colorful spaces, some with bunk beds, that look like a styled-out room at sleepaway camp. “Think seaside boathouse, lifeguard school, a homemade summer camp near the ocean,” says the designer Robin Standefer. Zobler, who traveled to hostels in the States and abroad and says he found that they “offered something lacking in many hotels — a culture where the guests were open to and often seeking out meaningful interactions with each other and where new friendships were being formed.” To that end, Freehand will have a vegetable garden, swimming pool, table tennis, bicycles and even art classes, as well as a restaurant and bar run by the folks behind local favorite Broken Shaker. And there will be towels, sheets, pillows and an amenity-stocked bathroom for every room — not always a given at hostels. As Standefer puts it, “it’s not a place with cheap beds to just crash in.” About 15 of the 60 rooms will be private (for one or two guests), while shared rooms will accommodate up to eight beds, with rates starting at about $50 for a bed in a shared room.

Shuck and Awe,2012-08-23,article,News,,"['Recipes', 'Corn', 'Cooking and Cookbooks']",A dozen recipes for corn off the cob.,"I don’t need to tell you that there are alternatives to eating corn straight from the cob: you’ve probably adored creamed corn for most of your life. (Possibly you’ve never made it from scratch, and if that’s the case, throw some kernels in a pan with some butter, and after a little while, add some cream along with seasoning. Heat. Eat.) But it’s equally probable that you haven’t done much else with corn kernels taken off the cob. This isn’t a revolutionary process (it’s as old as corn), nor is it difficult: Stand shucked corn upright in a bowl and use a paring knife to cut down along the kernels, as close to the cob as you can. Really dig that knife in — you want everything you can get from the cob. Corn kernels are a revelation, assuming, of course, that the corn is good to begin with. And right now, it should be (and it should be just fine raw, as it is in the first three of these ideas). So before corn costs $6 an ear next year, go for it."
Venus and Serena Against the World,2012-08-23,article,News,,['Tennis'],"15 years after the sisters’ first U.S. Open, theirs is still the most interesting story in sports.","There’s video that exists of Venus and Serena Williams playing tennis when they were kids — 8 and 7, respectively — in the late ’80s, on unshaded but otherwise decent-looking public courts in California. This is not one of the clips you’ve maybe seen, taken from various news segments, but an earlier, stranger video, made by their father and longtime coach, Richard Williams, as a kind of audition tape for the tennis-instructional guru Vic Braden, ostensibly requesting an invitation to Braden’s camp, although the real reason for it, you can’t help feel in watching, simply was to let Braden know that greatness had arrived in the world. Richard’s face in the film as he presents the girls to Braden seems, as it does so often, on the brink of laughter. This was in Compton, the low-income, gang-afflicted hub city outside Los Angeles, an area made infamous by many a rap song. Although they enjoyed about as stable an upbringing as you could have in Compton back then, its problems were no mere abstraction: they supposedly knew to lie down on the court when gunshots rang out in the park. And there’s a story that Richard, when asked what he would do if his daughters ever won a Grand Slam, said he would go back and try to help the Crips who sometimes looked out for the girls during their practice sessions. “Venus Williams Is Straight Outta Compton!” read an early promotional poster their father made, to post on telephone poles. He billed the two as celebrities before they were even famous. That was how you did it. Not fake it till you make it. You decided what you were. First you had the belief, and then you had the training. “Belief and training,” Venus told me a couple of weeks ago when I met with her in Cincinnati, where she and Serena were playing in a tournament just days after returning from the Olympics. “That was unconquerable.”"

Grown-Up Angst,2012-08-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Molly Ringwald’s fiction debut centers on a couple in a troubled marriage.,"Even when she was MOLLY RINGWALD, Molly Ringwald wasn’t content just being Molly Ringwald. In 1988 the teen idol reteamed with her “Pretty in Pink” co-star Andrew McCarthy for “Fresh Horses,” a talky drama about a tough, sullen Kentucky country girl who catches the eye of an engaged engineering student. For moviegoers who went in expecting the plucky high schooler she played in the earlier movie, or “Sixteen Candles,” “Fresh Horses” was a real downer. The group of much more popular friends to whom I recommended it abandoned me halfway through for “Ernest Saves Christmas” and never hung out with me again. I loved it, though — in part because you could see how hard Ringwald was working to be not just a teen-movie star but an actress. That she couldn’t yet pull it off made “Fresh Horses” poignant, and no less enjoyable — and as fans of the ABC Family series “The Secret Life of the American Teenager” know, in the end she has become an actress, and not a bad one at all."

Can You Keep a Secret?,2012-08-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Rebecca Stead’s hero contends with a bully and an eccentric new friend.,"Unlike her Newbery Medal-­winning novel, “When You Reach Me,” in which time travel is the subtext to all the interwoven story lines, Rebecca Stead’s new book, “Liar & Spy,” is firmly grounded in the here and now. What the two do share is a mood of shimmery unrest. Part coming­-of-age tale, part mystery, “Liar & Spy” takes place in contemporary Brooklyn and revolves around a seventh-grade loner and misfit named Georges. Cast out of his own home after his father loses his job and the family sells their house to make ends meet — and cast off by his best friend in favor of the popular clique — Georges finds himself living in a new apartment building with a cast of eccentric neighbors.

Hanging on Every Word,2012-08-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A story inspires an app, a short film and now a book.","It may be telling that “The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore,” a kind of totem to the unmatched joys of reading, appeared in two different screen adaptations before making the transition into print. Winning an Oscar earlier this year for best animated short after appearing, last summer, as a lauded animated app, William Joyce’s story of a natty Southern loner was a feat of digital imagination, a dazzlingly polished animation and a wordless tribute to a fading literary age. Now, realized at last as a children’s book, his tale gains elegance but loses depth. The print-edition “Morris Lessmore” is a stylishly paced, vividly illustrated parable for young readers, yet it somehow lacks the dreamy creativity of its animated precursors. Ultimately, Joyce’s book tells us something we may already suspect: that storytelling these days has a broader canvas than the hallowed space within the ­library doors."

This often makes sense both psychologically and narratively. These are the years when children begin to differentiate themselves from their parents and learn to fight their own battles.

Now new research indicates that their effects may be passed down from generation to generation in humans. Using doses of the chemical BPA similar to what humans encounter, the study shows that exposure to the chemical in pregnant mice can affect the sociability of their children and their children’s children. This should be devastating for Big Chem, which has so far been able to block any meaningful national curbs on endocrine disruptors.

A galette is a free-form pie, more rustic than a tart. Although they’re usually made with classic buttery pie dough or puff pastry, I’ve been working at developing a dough recipe that is delicate and tasty but not too rich. I decided that a yeasted dough could work, and came up with a formula that yields enough for two galettes but has only 60 grams of butter (about 4 tablespoons). The flavor is nutty and rich because of the whole-wheat flour, but the dough isn’t heavy. The trick is to roll it very thin, then freeze it right away so that it doesn’t continue to rise and become too bready, and also so that it’s easy to work with when you are ready to assemble the tart. The dough works beautifully for these free-form galettes."

On Chris Christie’s “Flop”,2012-08-29,article,News,,[],The strange trashing of a not-great but pretty good speech.,"I wrote my Campaign Stops column today about Ann Romney’s convention speech, but I should say something about Chris Christie’s address, given how quickly it’s been branded as a solipsistic flop. There is, of course, no real way to disprove the conventional wisdom in a case like this: Nobody (to my knowledge) conducts insta-polls of the TV audience’s reaction to a keynote speech, so if the chattering and political classes agree that Christie laid an egg, then that’s how his remarks will be remembered. But it’s worth noting that the indictment against the New Jersey governor is … distinctly underwhelming. He stands accused of talking too much about himself and not enough about Mitt Romney (or maybe not enough about Barack Obama, depending on which critique you read), and generally of failing to deliver the kind of tour de force that reporters are accustomed to seeing in his YouTube clips. But as even the big Politico piece calling the speech a “flop” allows, the most famous keynotes — Mario Cuomo in 1984 and Barack Obama in 2004 — were less about touting the nominee than laying out a broader vision of what the party stood for, and that was pretty clearly what Christie was trying to do as well. And I don’t think he did it all that badly. He made conservatism seem attractive, caricatured liberalism effectively, recast Romney in his own truthtelling image without mentioning of the details that might complicate that recasting, and generally came across as what he is: A tough-talking, charismatic politician, and an effective spokesman for the G.O.P."

Patriotism and Poultry,2012-08-31,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",George Orwell’s diaries covered everything from his strong feelings about World War II to his careful counting of eggs laid by Moroccan hens.,"Christopher Hitchens’s introduction to George Orwell’s “Diaries,” among the last things he wrote before his death, is meant as a tribute to one of the writers he most admired, but it can also be taken as a warning. “Read with care, these diaries . . . can greatly enrich our understanding of how Orwell transmitted the raw material of everyday experience into some of his best-known novels and polemics.” Read with care? What is Hitchens trying to tell us with that phrase? A few sentences later we have: “This diary is not by any means a ‘straight’ guide or a trove of clues and cross-references.” About the creative process that went into constructing one of the novels, Hitchens says Orwell “gives us little or no insight.” Most tellingly, he refers to the entries as “meticulous and occasionally laborious jottings.” Read with care, Hitchens’s introduction alerts Orwell devotees that they should not expect the same pleasures from this book that they get from other of his writings."

During the years in which the novel unfolds, from 1936 to the beginning of the new millennium, being a New Yorker meant something specific and unfakable, and Mattison captures that essence of city life, beginning with how New Yorkers talked and then moving on to the small details that speak volumes, like this one, which comes at the beginning of the description of a dinner party: “They had no hall closet.” "

Before setting out her case for an unexpected original behind the original, Frank catalogs Crusoe’s latter-day incarnations, which have included “a hero of Romantic individualism, of Victorian Empire or 20th-century capitalism, an explorer, an inventor, the embodiment of radical or conservative ideologies, an evangelist, a prophet of positive psychology and the gospel of prosperity, even an antihero.” Surveying this long and varied afterlife, she declares, “You name it and someone has probably thought and said Crusoe has been it.

No vivid colors. No sweeping borders. No topiary animals. No shooting fountains. No fun, it would seem.

Romney’s Speech and Obama’s Opportunity,2012-08-31,article,News,,[],"What Romney’s speech accomplished, and the opening it left the Democrats.","Watching Mitt Romney’s convention speech last night, I felt like I was watching the best possible execution of what’s been the Romney campaign’s strategy for most of this general-election season. That strategy sees a public sufficiently primed to vote against Barack Obama that all Romney needs to do is present a plausible, acceptable, non-threatening alternative and he can grab a narrow, 51-49 win. It sees the kind of steps required to potentially expand that 51 percent to, say, 53 percent as simply too risky – in a polarized country and with a restive base – for the Republican candidate to undertake. And if you accept those two premises, last night’s speech was well-conceived and well-delivered: It was a genuinely humanizing and even moving performance that addressed what’s been his biggest liability to date – his career at Bain Capital – head-on while otherwise supplying only the most general, non-threatening account of what a President Romney might actually do in office. If all Romney needs to do to win in November is be an acceptable alternative for a weary and disappointed electorate, then this performance helped him clear that bar."

They have long maintained that without the protections, hunters and ranchers in the area will kill wolves indiscriminately and ruin one of conservation’s biggest success stories. Ranchers argue that even if the overall cost of wolf attacks on cattle may be small, it can mean the difference between profit and loss in marginal operations. "
