Kikuo Johnson.,"Matt Madden is the stuntman-philosopher of American comics. His best-known book, “99 Ways to Tell a Story,” riffed on Raymond Queneau’s “Exercises in Style.” That bible of experimental writing from 1947 retold a mundane scenario — a mild contretemps on a Paris bus — with precision (“In a bus of the S line, 10 meters long, 3 wide, 6 high …”), in Cockney (“A sees vis young Froggy bloke, caw bloimey …”) and so on. Transposing the conceit to the graphic medium, Madden devised his own non-anecdote: Man leaves desk, opens fridge, tells someone the time, then can’t recall why he stood up in the first place. This ball of nothing gets reworked as (among other things) a batch of daily comic strips, a piece of the Bayeux Tapestry and a do-it-yourself kit in which each element (from wristwatch to lettering) is separated as if in a box, ready for assembly. The hilarity mounts, but so does the mystery of what makes a story. In flaunting style over substance, he shows them to be one and the same."

We know we all remember things a little differently, with reality fracturing into competing narratives the further we get from any given occurrence. But when disaster is near-universal and the gulf of disagreement vast, it’s easy to question our own recollections as suspect.

Immersive and Dramatic New Photography Books,2021-12-03,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Photography']","Lucy Sante analyzes works from Annie Leibovitz, Harry Gruyaert, Gilles Peress, Catherine Opie and other masters of the form.","The sheer physical mass of Gilles Peress’s WHATEVER YOU SAY, SAY NOTHING (Steidl/D.A.P., 1,960 pp., $480) is intimidating. Two enormous volumes of plates, the size of 19th-century ledgers, and an accompanying almanac, “Annals of the North” — the dimensions of a hard-bound dictionary — constitute this account of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, beginning in 1972 and extending past the end of the 20th century. Peress, from Paris, went to Derry as a young Magnum photographer, knowing little English; right away he witnessed the British Army’s massacre of 14 civilians in what became known as Bloody Sunday. Within a year, he had embedded himself so thoroughly that his photographs were often called upon as evidence in court. He developed ties with many people, sometimes tragically; one of his closest Republican friends turned out to be an informer and was killed by the I.R.A. It is clear from this work — the title comes from the I.R.A.’s “Green Book” — that Peress left a chunk of his soul in Ulster.

In the 80 years since she gave her final performance, “I want to be alone” (a line she spoke in “Grand Hotel”)  has become the thing for which she is best remembered — more than her talent, probably more than her beauty and certainly more than her movies, of which even a lot of cinephiles would have trouble naming five. Her professional legacy is lean: Even the two famous slogans associated with her — “Garbo Talks!” for her first sound picture, “Anna Christie,” and “Garbo Laughs” for her most enduring (let’s just say best), Ernst Lubitsch’s “Ninotchka”  — herald deviations from the norm.

On the way to the checkout, he marveled at a product he said he’d already purchased from a different dollar store: a clock radio with a built-in fish tank far too tiny for a fish, a “cool dollar-store-only object.” The entire place suddenly felt like a tidy analogue of Wilson’s show: filled with things too mundane, too accidentally strange, too tacky or sad or flawed or lacking in panache, to actively star in anyone else’s account of the world."

Will Smith Is Done Trying to Be Perfect,2021-12-09,article,News,,"['Content Type: Personal Profile', 'Actors and Actresses', 'Movies']",“Strategizing about being the biggest movie star in the world — that is all completely over. ”,"Will Smith’s superpower as a performer — as a movie star — has always been his radiating charisma. Who else could have credibly portrayed Muhammad Ali, the most charismatic man ever? In “King Richard,” Smith transmutes that gift into something subtler but just as powerful in his portrayal of Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena. (Smith, as he was eager to acknowledge, was supported in the film by Saniyya Sidney as Venus, Demi Singleton as Serena and Aunjanue Ellis as the girls’ mother and Williams’s wife at the time, Oracene Price.) Richard Williams, as embodied by Smith, is a man who has been physically bowed but not beaten. He has a limp from a racist attack as a child; his carriage is tense, a little unsure, as if always on alert for a sucker punch. He’s someone who has spent time beneath the underdog. And yet when it comes to Williams’s daughters and his dreams for them of tennis greatness, Smith invests his character with his trademark on-screen self-assurance. That Smith, who is 53 and who this autumn published a searching memoir, “Will,” was able to express those disparate traits so effectively is something he attributes to the work, precipitated by that book, that he has lately put into himself. “I wouldn’t have been able to play Richard Williams in this way,” Smith says, “before I had examined my life and understood so many aspects of my childhood and how that affected the decisions I made as a parent.”"

His thinking has also changed, he said. “Twenty-five years of fine dining, which is more conceptual and less from the heart, is enough,” he said. What hasn’t changed is having Alberto Carballo, the chef de cuisine, at his side. A soaring 180-seat dining room, a sea of beige designed by David Rockwell, sits on a level below the bar and open kitchen. There are tapas; fried items like cod fritters; bigger portions (raciones), many with seafood; and rice and noodle specialties.

Jody Williams and Rita Sodi Open Commerce Inn in the West Village,2021-12-21,article,News,,['Restaurants'],"An offshoot of Sushi Noz in Chelsea, a pop-up boutique from the Greek chef Maria Loi and more restaurant news.","In their latest venture, Jody Williams and Rita Sodi, who own four highly regarded restaurants in the West Village, have been seduced by history. And it’s not just the history of this location, which was built in 1911, and formerly housed Fifty, Commerce, Grange Hall, Blue Mill Tavern and a speakeasy before that. “We’re taking it back to a colonial tavern,” Ms. Williams said, even including a Tavern Room, fitted with a dark wood back bar, a zinc counter, custom stools and compact booths. They also did their homework, looking to an old store in Virginia that was once a train station for floor and ceiling boards, a Vermont maker of Shaker-style furniture for the chairs and benches in the large dining room and even the fonts Ms. Sodi used for the menu. “It’s all about simplicity and craftsmanship,” Ms. Williams said. Food in the tavern, open now with the dining room coming soon, starts with oysters served raw, pickled or fried. Then the choices are smoked cod cakes, country ham, marrow with mushrooms, greens with buttermilk dressing, spoon bread and baked apple. Wines are domestic, mostly East Coast. The dinner menu, in the sparsely decorated white-tablecloth dining room, will feature roasts like duck and pork. For breakfast, also on the horizon, there will be scrapple, porridge, eggs and smoked fish. In keeping with the historic approach, bartenders haul ice for drinks like milk punches and switchels in 25-pound blocks with vintage tongs, and electronics are hidden in drawers. There is no espresso machine. But at the same time, Ms. Williams and Ms. Sodi insist it’s not a theme park frozen in the past: They use olive oil, not typical of the era being evoked. “It fits with some of our dishes, but we’re also thrilled to be using ingredients that aren’t French or Italian, to be exploring a new genre,” Ms. Williams said. “We’re having a lot of fun.”"
