His art involves people, not things, and the process of selling it is entirely verbal. Sehgal does not issue receipts. He does not permit his work to be photographed or filmed, nor does he produce catalogs or even wall labels to accompany his exhibitions.

For a 2010 show at the Guggenheim Museum called “This Progress,” a series of increasingly older interpreters guided visitors up the museum’s spiraled rotunda while carrying on free-form conversations that began with the visitor’s personal definition of progress. His most famous work, “Kiss,” from 2002, involves a man and a woman recreating iconic embraces from artworks throughout history, inspired by oeuvres as distinct as those of Auguste Rodin and Jeff Koons, on the floor of an exhibition space."

American modernists who both spent formative periods in Paris (in the late 1920s and late 1940s, respectively), Calder and Kelly eventually met in that city and maintained a lasting fondness for one another, despite an age difference of 25 years."

Picks of the Litter: Dog Picture Books for Every Child — and Grown-Up,2018-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Finding and losing, playing and working, caring and staying true — dog books teach us about all those things while tugging at our heartstrings.","Romantic love, platonic love, parental love — I’d hate to live without any of them. But dog love took me by surprise a year ago, when it arrived relatively late in life with Marco, my first dog. So, like many before me, I became a seeker-outer of dog books. Dog picture books, especially, which are easy to enjoy with or without a child. (If you doubt that, please watch the YouTube video of Betty White reading “Harry the Dirty Dog,” which has over five million views.) All animals have lessons for us, but none have as much to show fledgling humans — and some of us older ones — about finding and losing, playing and working, caring and staying true. And the creators of dog picture books deliver those while blatantly dialing up the emotions — who can forget the scene in “Madeline’s Rescue” where Genevieve gives birth to 11 puppies? In that grand tradition, these five new books are the pick of the litter."

Great New Children’s Books About Animals,2018-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Why do critters feature in so many memorable kids books? Novels by Sharon Creech, Carl Hiaasen and more show once again how animals help us understand the world.","So much of early childhood is about animals. We dress toddlers in T-shirts emblazoned with zoo creatures, teach them songs about livestock and tuck them in with stuffed bunnies. Their picture books feature peace-loving bulls, cookie-loving mice and oversize red dogs who make excellent stand-ins for little humans. But the middle-grade years — when kids’ passions are still more fixed on kittens and horses than the opposite sex — are the real sweet spot for animal books. This is when we get animal protagonists with inner lives as complicated as a 10-year-old’s (“Charlotte’s Web”) and tender stories about kids whose beloved pets help them grow and mature (I call them bildogsromans), like Kate DiCamillo’s “Because of Winn-Dixie.” There’s also the recurring theme of an animal rescued by a resourceful child — what could feel more empowering to a 10-year-old than saving a life? Four new novels provide their own twists on these classic story lines and prove, once again, that tales about animals can help kids understand the world and themselves."

A Letter to the Army: Don’t Punish the Man Who Led the Mission That Killed My Son,2018-11-14,article,News,,['United States Defense and Military Forces'],The father of one of the American soldiers killed in Niger last year writes a letter of support for the Army captain who led the fateful mission.,"After multiple investigations into the ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers dead last year, the United States Army punished several people who were involved in the mission, including the two soldiers who led the 11-man team when militants attacked it. Those punished were not reprimanded for what happened during the ambush but rather what led up to it, including poor training alongside Nigerien troops, a lack of pre-mission rehearsals and what investigators called a misleading mission plan. The leader of the Special Forces team, Capt. Mike Perozeni, along with his second in command, received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand, known as a GOMOR. A reprimand’s impact is based on where it is placed in a soldier’s file. If the letter is considered “local,” it will disappear after the soldier changes jobs. If it is permanent, it likely means the end of a career. The soldier, and others on his behalf, can write a rebuttal. Below is a letter written on behalf of Captain Perozeni by Henry Black, the father of Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, one of the four soldiers killed in the ambush. A version of this letter was delivered to Maj. Gen. Edwin J. Deedrick Jr., the commanding officer of the First Special Forces Command, who administered the letters. With Black’s permission, it has been lightly edited for clarity and to protect the identity of some of the soldiers, whose names have not been released. Thomas Gibbons-Neff"

What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,2018-11-14,article,Review,,['Art'],John Houck’s visual trickery; Svenja Deininger’s “Crescendo” paintings; Didier William’s eye-catching mixed-media works; and the poet John Ashbery’s demure treasures.,"The Los Angeles photographer John Houck creates multiple layers of visual trickery in deceptively simple still lifes by shooting and reshooting life-size color prints that he alters as he goes. In “Accumulator #20, 3 Colors #B2DAE5, #B4867B, #B46E5C,” for example, the diptych that opens his first solo show at Marianne Boesky’s New York gallery, “Holding Environment,” he folded the prints before reshooting to incorporate vivid trompe l’oeil creases, complete with graded shadows, in the final images.

What other deceptive appearances, you have to wonder, have taken you in on your way into the gallery?"

Barlow, 74, is a British artist renowned for her often-soaring sculptures cobbled together from industrial refuse, as though an ordinary urban street had suddenly come alive and risen up into a sentient colossus. Maiolino, 76, is an Italian, São Paulo-based artist celebrated for her modeled- and rolled-clay installations and sculptures that suggest the work of “a housewife gone mad,” as the curator Helen Molesworth once put it, and evoke everything from human organs, phalluses and rolls of bread to prehistoric worms. Barlow had a traditional arts education at London’s Chelsea College of Arts, followed by the Slade. Maiolino had a very nontraditional upbringing and education, migrating with her family from Italy to Venezuela during World War II, and then from Venezuela to Brazil, where her performances, videos and works on paper contributed, alongside work by Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, to the Neo-Concrete and New Objectivity movements at a time of political upheaval in Brazil. (She audited classes at an art school in Rio de Janeiro but considers herself largely self-taught.) Both artists are mothers, and both received full recognition for their pioneering work late in life — and continue to make work in their 70s as a matter of some urgency. This month, their artworks are on view in concurrent solo exhibitions at Hauser & Wirth in New York, where we met on a brisk fall morning. There, the two artists sat down together to talk about their work and lives for the first time."

This time: the singer and the director.,"What does the Belgian dramatist Ivo van Hove have in common with the American-Canadian singer Rufus Wainwright? For one, they’re both artists whose gay identity is neither incidental to their work nor all-consuming. For another, they are both tireless artistic explorers, catholic in the extreme. Wainwright, son of the ’70s singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, fused indie folk and soft glam into a series of highly personal albums, beginning with his eponymous debut in 1998 and continuing through his pair of dynamic 2003-4 “Want” albums. Then he decided to write operas — the second, “Hadrian,” with a libretto by Daniel MacIvor, premiered in Toronto in October — and to compose music for the renowned American experimental theater director Robert Wilson’s 2009 staging of Shakespeare’s sonnets in Berlin. These works brought him into the creative orbit of the Amsterdam-based van Hove, whose freewheeling multimedia adaptations pay equal homage to avant-garde performance pioneers like Wilson and august playwrights like Arthur Miller, whose “The Crucible” and “A View From the Bridge” he reimagined earlier this decade. (His theater company, Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, recently premiered “A Little Life,” adapted from the novel written by T’s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara.) Wainwright and van Hove met up one October night in a Japanese restaurant in downtown New York; van Hove, 60, had just finished a day of rehearsals for the Broadway adaptation of Sidney Lumet’s prescient 1976 media satire, “Network” (opening Dec. 6), which he is directing and which stars Bryan Cranston. Wainwright, 45, had just flown in from his home in Los Angeles, the day after debuting his tense, beautiful and political new single, “Sword of Damocles,” as he prepares to go on tour. They were coming from disparate places, running on different clocks, but immediately opened up about that which matters most to them: politics, coming out, the multiplicity of the self — and the benefits of boarding school.

He had been invited to give a talk during Bergman Week, an annual festival at which fans attend lectures and screenings and go on “Bergman Safaris,” driving on one-lane roads to the pebbly coasts and placid cabins where many of the Swedish director’s films were made.

He saw an original print of “Persona” in the 15-seat private theater, where Bergman’s ample leather recliner is always left empty in the front of the room, and even viewed a segment from one of his own works (“Dogtooth,” his second film), something he hardly ever does. While editing, he watches each film over and over, so by the time it’s ready to be shown, he “can’t wait until it’s the last time, for at least 10, 15 years.” His reaction was similar to the one he’d once had while rewatching “Kinetta,” his first movie: “Strange, strange, but not so bad, really.”"

As he surveyed the herd, an idea struck: “Human baby hair is infinitely softer than an adult’s. The same is probably true of baby goats.” Thus was born baby cashmere, made from the almost-weightless inner coat of the kid, available only once in each animal’s lifetime, when they are between 3 and 8 months old.

The American Spirit of Coach’s Stuart Vevers,2018-11-27,article,News,,['Fashion and Apparel'],His ready-to-wear collections reflect a lifelong fascination with Americana as seen through “the outsider perspective of an Englishman in New York.”,"Coach’s creative director, Stuart Vevers, first started paying attention to clothes at the Manchester and Leeds nightclubs he visited as a teenager. “Before that, I was a kid from a working-class family in Northern England who didn’t know the fashion industry even existed,” he says. “Then all of a sudden, I was obsessively dressing in paisley shirts and vintage velvet blazers and customizing my jeans.” At 18, he left his home in Cumbria to study fashion at London’s University of Westminster, graduating with an assistant job at Calvin Klein in New York (“I showed up at the interviewer’s hotel unannounced and begged her to look at my portfolio”). He returned to Europe two years later, eventually landing as the head of accessories at Givenchy and then at Louis Vuitton, where Marc Jacobs was his mentor. With the launches of Givenchy’s pumpkin bags and the multicolor monograms Takashi Murakami collaborated on with Louis Vuitton, Vevers became synonymous with the early 2000s It-bag phenomenon and was hired to reinvigorate Mulberry in 2004, followed by Loewe in 2007. Those roles made him an obvious choice for Coach, the American heritage brand that got its start in 1941 producing billfolds and briefcases inspired by baseball gloves. “Although I use our history as a jumping-off point, I felt we needed to radically catapult forward,” says Vevers, 45. “On day one, I decided to think beyond just accessories.”"

Taiwanese Fried Chicken and Bubble Tea Head to the Flatiron District,2018-11-27,article,News,,"['Restaurants', 'Chefs']","A new boutique restaurant in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, a seasonal pop-up in Williamsburg, and more restaurant news.","This new eat-in, take-out spot is a Taiwanese doubleheader. Kung Fu Tea, a Taiwanese-style bubble tea company that started in 2010 in Flushing, Queens, and now has 200 outlets in 30 states, has joined forces with TKK Fried Chicken, a chain founded in 1974 in Taiwan. The Taiwanese recipe called “original” on the menu is crisp and moderately spiced. There is also a milder version and, for the American market, a crisper, more forcefully seasoned one. How is this fried chicken different from the Korean variety found all over New York? “Taiwanese fried chicken is first marinated for 24 hours to add flavor,” said Steven Luw, the general operating manager. “Then it gets a flour breading and is fried once. Korean fried chicken is usually dipped in batter and fried twice.” The company, which will count this location as its first American restaurant in addition to the 68 branches it has in Taiwan and Shanghai, is also offering items that are not on the menu in Asia, including curly fries, a fried chicken sandwich, chunky coleslaw, Wisconsin-style cheese curds, biscuits and seared shishito peppers. The bubble tea partnership provides many colorful teas with optional toppings like red beans and crushed Oreos, served at varying sweetness, iced to hot. Beer and wine are also served. The bright space has tables in front and back separated by an open kitchen and ordering counter. It took but a few minutes during a recent trial period for this place to become a canteen for nearby Baruch College students. (Opens Friday) "

How the Myth of the Hedonistic Artist Lost Its Allure,2018-11-28,article,News,,"['Art', 'Writing and Writers', 'Poetry and Poets', 'Books and Literature']",These days — despite longstanding clichés about art and excess — the creative impulse can actually be more closely tied to asceticism.,"A PREVAILING NOTION of the lives of artists holds that hedonism is a meaningful part of production. The slide projector on the subject has no shortage of famous faces: There’s boozy Faulkner, banging out novels and screenplays while pickled, and Dorothy Parker and Jackson Pollock, producing their poems and paintings alongside the empty bottles, not to mention those libertine de Sades, Baudelaires and Byrons, who were all about sex and drugs long before rock ’n’ roll introduced the idea that heroin was the magic juice of musical genius, one that spit out Hendrix and Joplin on one sad side and a sober Keith Richards on the happy other. The notion is nothing new. In classical Greece, in fourth- and fifth-century Athens, the major artistic prize of the era, for drama, was given under the auspices of Dionysus, a god of wine and ecstasy. Dionysus is a curious proto-patron saint of the arts, given the story of his birth. Zeus — king of gods, thunder god — wooed the mortal Semele.

T’s Holiday Issue: All Together Now,2018-11-30,article,News,,"['Art', 'Writing and Writers', 'Politics and Government']",The idea of the artist (or designer or director or author) creating in a vacuum has always been a romance and has never seemed more mythical than it does today.,"It is an irresistible reduction to contrast the eras of our former and current president as absolute opposites: one, an age of progress for all of us who’ve felt or feel shut out from the vast tent that is our country; the other, an age of regress. Yet to think this way ignores evidence to the contrary — evidence in the form of human lives. One of the great paradoxes of America is that we could be a country that elected its first black president, one whose term saw, yes, a radically more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but also one of the worst school shootings in our history, a mass shooting at a gay nightclub and multiple murders of unarmed black boys and men, shot because of who they were, not what they did. Crucially, that president’s reactions to these horrors were markedly different than those of our current president to similar incidents, but the fact remains that no era since our founding has been free of these contradictions (indeed, these murders that occurred during the previous administration were not new developments — it was technology that enabled their immediate and widespread dissemination). The thrill and sorrow of America is that our brief history is one of steps forward and backward, that ours is a nation in a constant state of revision, that we are each of us choreographers of its halting, tripping, sometimes ugly, sometimes transcendent dance."

It is comfort, escapism and reassurance in a troubling world. It is generic in the truest sense, a genre defined and constrained by a handful of conventions. The heart of every romance is a love story, and by the last page of the book the lovers wind up together, happily ever after or at least “happily for now.” (Less codified but no less crucial is that no children or pets are harmed. This is a place for happy endings, after all.) These rules give rise to a rich variety of stories, but they are constraints nonetheless.

11 New Books We Recommend This Week,2018-11-30,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Some fiction writers try to capture reality, using stories to illuminate social conditions or plumb interior lives. Others just like to make up crazy things. (And also illuminate social conditions and interior lives, yes! Don’t @ us.) We like both kinds of fiction around here, but our picks this week decidedly, and determinedly, range beyond the bounds of conventional realism. There’s an austere little fairy tale about the chaos of sexual desire, “The Governesses.” There’s a turbulent, myth-inflected debut that made its author the youngest-ever finalist for the Booker Prize, “Everything Under.” There’s a dystopian New York story about consumerism and immigration, “Severance,” and a surreal Japanese story collection, “The Lonesome Bodybuilder,” that shakes up narrative expectations right alongside social expectations about gender and marriage and body image. And while Louisa Hall’s “Trinity” would seem to be more traditional than any of those — it’s a biographical, historical novel about Robert Oppenheimer and his work on the atomic bomb — even that goes about it in a nontraditional way."

It’s a metaphor, of course, for the book itself — an opus of more than 500 pages set in the late 1920s in the titular city, teeming with journalists and junkmen, artists and runaways, fiery rabble-rousers and burnt-out cases from the First World War, perceiving the city with their own nervous systems."

His band was a group of New York musicians, some of whom Mr. McCraven had hardly played with before; what they performed was entirely improvised, but with Mr. McCraven subtly steering, listeners had room to get comfortable, to fall into the music. His thick snare drum splattered against the bulb tones of Joel Ross’s vibraphone patterns, making an elliptical groove.
