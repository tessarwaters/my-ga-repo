10 New Books We Recommend This Week,2019-05-02,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Before April recedes too far into the rearview, let’s pause a moment to appreciate a month that gave us cause — as if we needed it — to celebrate both earth and verse. Whether you wanted a book for Earth Day (April 22) or for National Poetry Month (the whole darn month), Brian Teare’s “Doomstead Days” might have served: A collection of poems composed while walking, it honors and mourns the changing landscapes it encounters throughout. If that whets your appetite for more poetry, you should definitely read Morgan Parker’s “Magical Negro,” which cements her place as one of the smartest, liveliest, most accomplished young poets working today. Or if it fires you up to read more about the environment and what we’re doing to it, Nathaniel Rich’s “Losing Earth: A Climate History” (which started as an article for The Times Magazine) spins a bleak and gripping narrative about how we’ve reached this point. SMH, as the kids say online. That’s short for “shaking my head,” but in my house we thought for a long time it meant “so much hate.” In this case, both meanings apply."

It Took More Than 40 Days to Make This Cartier Necklace,2019-05-14,article,News,,"['Jewels and Jewelry', 'Gold']",Capturing one incredible piece in the middle of its creation. This month: a collar meant to resemble an exploding nebula.,"The making of a one-of-kind high jewelry piece often begins with a hunt for extraordinary stones. In the case of this recently completed elaborate collar by the Paris-based Cartier, that expedition began and ended at the annual gem show in Tucson, Ariz. While there are other such trade events throughout the world — Hong Kong, Basel, Switzerland, and Las Vegas also host prominent events — the Tucson show is the most idiosyncratic, with dealers bringing crystals, minerals and fossils in addition to precious and semiprecious stones. The six-person Cartier team spotted the more-than-15-carat octagonal yellow sapphire at a booth on the first day and a few hours later connected with a dealer who had a cache of brilliant blue lapis lazuli beads. Though purchases from a particular trip don’t always end up in the same piece, in this instance, the jewelers were struck by how the contrasting hues of pale orangy-yellow and intense cobalt might work together, echoing past Cartier collections that paired blue stones with gold."

The graves held so many dead that bodies burst through people’s basements. I once heard on a walking tour that Parisians who lived near these pre-catacomb graveyards couldn’t keep milk — it would spoil within hours. The bacteria in the air, from proximity to so much rotting flesh, would also turn wine. Catholicism forbade cremation, and crypts were already a public-health nightmare, so the only place to go was down. Burials within city limits were finally banned in 1780, after two decades of attempts. In 1785, the effort to remove human remains from graveyards and transfer them to underground tunnels was made law. That year, an old limestone mine was turned into an ossuary, and the city began moving all the bones there."

This means that even the casual traveler also faces an ethical dilemma when she chooses where to visit. What about a country’s treatment of minorities? What about its freedom of speech or the transparency of its government? And if we do go to a country ruled by a despot or military junta, will our currency benefit the nation’s citizens or only the regime that oppresses them? While there are few widely agreed upon rules for answering these questions, asking them seems increasingly vital. Here, seven travel writers contemplate the ethical ambiguities of travel."

Either way, the complexity of humans underlies a whole lot of relationships and therapy sessions — and books, which are kind of our deal around here. This week we recommend George Packer’s biography of Richard Holbrooke, as complicated a human as ever served in the State Department, along with Aaron Bobrow-Strain’s account of an undocumented Mexican immigrant (she’s complicated) and, speaking of therapy, the analyst Lori Gottlieb’s reflections on her patients and her own time on the couch.

Now, there are about 20 brands of extra-virgin olive oil in South Africa. Mr. Bertrand died last year at 91, but his daughters, Federica and Alessandra Bertrand, continue to run the estate, which has 30,000 trees and also produces wines. And the olive oils are perennial prizewinners. The 2018 bottling was ranked among the best in the world by Flos Olei, an olive oil guidebook. The 2018 oil is the estate’s flagship blend of 14 varietals, each picked and pressed separately before being combined.

Slather asparagus with miso for grilling. Make a “bouillabaisse” with fennel, potatoes, tomatoes and rouille but no fish. A “poke” bowl features beets instead of tuna.

This became clear to Franz when his teachers in Berlin cast stealthily malicious glances at him when Jewish characters — such as Shylock in “The Merchant of Venice” — came up in literature. “Eh, Michalski, this exactly pertains to you,” he recalls one teacher telling him through a clenched smile. Many years later, when he worked as an animal-feed trader in Hamburg, he didn’t tell friends that he was Jewish and held his tongue when he heard them make anti-Semitic comments.

With “Game of Thrones” having heaved its last breath of dragon fire on  Sunday, many have been left looking for a new series to fill the sword-shaped void. One holier option is this medieval mystery mini-series, the adaptation of Umberto Eco’s best-known novel, “The Name of the Rose,” by the  Italian director Giacomo Battiato. The book, which came out in 1980,  sold millions of copies, and was the basis for a 1986 film adaptation with Sean Connery. The role Connery played, a Franciscan friar named William of Baskerville, is here played by John Turturro. The plot involves  mysterious deaths at a remote abbey. When the Connery movie came out, Vincent Canby said in his review for The New York Times that it had cut out the novel’s scholarly asides, which “cover everything from the political maneuvering within the Avignon papacy, the fight for the Holy Roman Empire and the church’s merciless suppression of heresies (Waldensian, Albigensian and Catharist, among others) to the invention of eyeglasses and gunpowder.” The mini-series format might make room for more of Eco’s embellishments onscreen."

The tradition, which means “smelling the breeze” in Arabic, is believed to be as old as the pharaohs, and celebrates the arrival of spring. Egyptians gather outdoors in public gardens, in zoos, in public spaces, on boats on the Nile and elsewhere, and feast on salted fermented fish, lettuce, beans and boiled eggs — all foods believed to be what was originally offered to the gods in ancient times. “In Cairo, it’s a really fun day,” explained Gohar. “There are people from all walks of life — it’s not a religious holiday — young and old, rich and poor, everyone celebrates the holiday.”"

8 New Books We Recommend This Week,2019-05-23,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Those who forget history are … in luck, actually. This week’s recommended reading includes refreshers on everything from the settling of Polynesia to Brooklyn’s past as a queer enclave to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868. There’s art history, in María Gainza’s autofiction about an Argentine critic; and literary history, in Casey Cep’s riveting account of the true-crime story that Harper Lee was never able to write; a fictional look back at Palestine in the early 1900s; and a nonfiction analysis of European history from 1950 until the age of Brexit. It’s a list that might appeal to the heroine of Binnie Kirshenbaum’s novel “Rabbits for Food,” were she not sidelined by a crippling depression: “Bunny’s range of interests,” Kirshenbaum writes early in the book, is “varied: history, politics, antiques, animal rights, psychology, fashion, and literature, serious literature, although now she is interested in nothing.” This novel isn’t about history per se, but that line — with its hint that we live at the edge of nihilism, and that all of our distractions are just so much scaffolding against the void — surely gets at one of history’s recurring themes, and one of the reasons we turn to it in the first place for edification and consolation: because we have survived so much (history tells us), and here we are."
