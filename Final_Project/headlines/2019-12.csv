Now, finally, the larger culture is taking cues from her.","IT WAS NEARLY closing time at the museum: Long shadows had already devoured most of downtown Los Angeles and the hangar-like space was hushed. Andrea Fraser stood before a small TV watching “Official Welcome,” one of her landmark performances. Onscreen, she appeared in a tasteful black dress at the opening of her 2003 exhibition in Hamburg, Germany, making remarks from a lectern. She thanked the curators who had made her retrospective possible; she thanked her mother, who had flown all the way from California for the event. The crowd clapped on cue. But then the woman went rogue, as though a computer virus had infected her gracious-artist software. “Thank you, Andrea,” she boomed in a deep male voice, morphing into the first of more than a dozen art-world personae who take over the speech — a piratical dealer, a fawning patron, an artist best known for pickling a shark. Before it’s over, she has shed her dress and then her Gucci bra, thong and stilettos to address the audience fully nude. “It takes a lot of courage to do what she does,” she said, assuming the voice of an approving critic. “She goes far beyond where most artists have the intelligence or audacity to operate.” The 30-minute piece — funny, brash and often excruciating — ends after the woman, back in her dress but somehow more exposed than ever, breaks down in sobs."

A Furniture Designer Who Learned Under Raf Simons,2019-12-03,article,News,,"['Furniture', 'Design', 'Tables', 'Desks']","Michaël Verheyden, who combines simple shapes with rich textures, will show a new collection at Design Miami.","As a student at Belgium’s LUCA School of Arts in the late ’90s, Michaël Verheyden counted the fashion designer Raf Simons as a mentor — he even modeled for Simons before launching his own line of handbags. Yet he graduated with a degree in industrial design, which he put to use when he and his wife, the designer Saartje Vereecke, bought their first home, in Genk, in 2009. After failing to find the sort of furniture they’d envisioned for the space, they started making their own pieces, and have been experimenting with clean-lined forms ever since. Verheyden’s latest collection, Archetypes, a 20-piece range that the Belgian gallerist Pierre Marie Giraud is showing at Design Miami, includes brass lamps, marble tables and a classic oak screen. It was inspired by the work of Donald Judd and Jean-Michel Frank, and, like them, Verheyden is interested in simple structures, but also in rich textures. “If I design a chair, I want people to recognize its basic shape — but then I like to play with the materials,” he says. Indeed, the collection’s benchlike sofa is strung with Manila cord and sits atop gouged oak legs evoking snakeskin, while a decorative brass bowl is polished smooth in parts but left rough and unfinished at its base. With his Tabula Runda writing desk, though, Verheyden plays with form as well: It contains two hidden drawers and legs that have been moved from the edges to the center, challenging our notions of just what an ideal table might be. As Verheyden says, “The answer is always to look at something long enough to see how I might change it.”"

Times Critics’ Top Books of 2019,2019-12-05,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Two Thousand Nineteen']",The Times’s staff critics give their choices of the best fiction and nonfiction works of the year.,"In the literary world, it has been a year of big, bold ambition. Novelists have stretched their canvases — writing a sentence that runs for a thousand pages; charting the fate of three families in Africa across four generations. Nonfiction writers have made riveting narrative from sprawling, difficult material: The Irish Troubles, the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, the history of the Lakota tribe. And memoirists have confronted harrowing and profound subjects: Life in New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina; decades spent in solitary confinement; psychological abuse in intimate relationships. Below, The New York Times’s three daily book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — share their thoughts about their favorites among the books they reviewed this year, each list alphabetical by author."

It was the work of bedroom-studio conspirators, of songwriters confronting their traumas and aspirations, of old hands challenging themselves and newcomers determined to warp accepted boundaries: artists working to please themselves at a time when gatekeepers can easily be bypassed. If it turned out that those private outpourings resonated with a wide audience, all the better — but that wasn’t the only goal."

The country’s isolated southern island state has been so overlooked in the past, it’s even been left off maps of Australia. In recent years, however, Australians have changed their tune. Tasmania is experiencing a surge of weekenders and property buyers, driven by a newfound interest in its pristine nature, unhurried way of life and an increasingly diverse food and art scene that really started to take off with the arrival, in a Hobart suburb, of the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in 2011. The biggest transformation has taken place in the once-sleepy capital of Hobart, which now boasts a plethora of creative new restaurants and an edgy spirit, particularly during the winter Dark Mofo festival. (A highlight: the nude solstice swim in the chilly River Derwent.) Tasmania’s profile is rising overseas, as well. International visitors jumped by 21 percent from mid-2017 to mid-2018 — the biggest rise by far of any Australian state. Tasmanians have always known how good the life is here. The rest of the world is only now starting to find out."

A Swiss Watch That Lets You in on Its Secrets,2019-12-10,article,News,,"['Watches and Clocks', 'Design', 'Fashion and Apparel']","Through the back of Vacheron Constantin’s luxurious new timepiece, you can see what makes it tick.","History often treats the engineering marvels of the 21st century as exponentially more virtuosic than what came before, but consider the tourbillon. Created in 1795 by the Paris-based watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet, a favorite of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the mechanism (French for “whirlwind”) is perhaps the most esoteric and elegant watch complication ever conceived. Born of horology’s obsession with maintaining accuracy to the millisecond, the tourbillon counteracts the effect of the earth’s gravity by constantly rotating the cage that holds the timepiece’s balance wheel, balance spring and escapement while the movement is running. The idea was to eliminate errors in rate — the loss or gain in time that would arise if the watch stayed too long in one position — by crafting an internal apparatus that continually turned on an axis. Such a marvel of intricacy must be witnessed to be fully understood: It is as transfixing as watching a heart beat. In this new incarnation by the Swiss company Vacheron Constantin, which has specialized in rarefied timepieces since its founding in 1755, you can stare at it all you want through the round porthole at the bottom of the blue lacquer dial or through its sapphire crystal back. Because the case is fashioned from stainless steel instead of the platinum or gold used for most tourbillon watches, this exemplar of late 18th-century ingenuity seems decidedly contemporary — and, perhaps, ever so slightly less beyond our grasp.

But putting it in the No. 1 slot for the year isn’t a close call. Not that Mercado Little Spain is without flaws. It has its share, starting with a name that’s too long. But it has made the city’s Spanish food scene, what, five times better? Ten times? Mercado Little Spain gives us ingredients we’ve never tasted in New York before, like weeks-old Ibérico pigs slowly melted over fire, or imported rabbit — so flavorful that nobody will say it tastes like chicken — in the Valencian paella cooked over burning logs. It also sells high-fidelity transcriptions of dishes from the chefs Ferran Adrià, whose liquid olives are still blowing minds, and his brother, Albert, who fed recipes to the outstanding pastry department. Somehow, though, the most impressive foods are the most elementary: the gazpacho that shimmers with olive oil and sherry vinegar; the thick, dark hot chocolate that comes with churros just out of the fryer; the goblets of gin and tonics. These and other dishes are so much better than what we’re used to that Mercado Little Spain might as well be the only Spanish restaurant in New York."

The Curious Case of the U.S. Government’s Influence on 20th-Century Design,2019-12-11,article,News,,"['United States Defense and Military Forces', 'Design', 'Espionage and Intelligence Services']","Known for its intelligence-gathering operations during World War II, the O.S.S. also helped shape the look of modern life.","THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES was the first centralized foreign intelligence agency in the United States, the direct precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. Founded during World War II by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the O.S.S. (or the Coordinator of Information, as it was originally called) was established “to collect, analyze, and correlate information and data bearing on national security, to make such data available to the President and such other officials as determined by the President, and to perform related supplementary activities.” And yet its role soon became much larger and more influential. The head of the O.S.S., Colonel William “Wild Bill” Donovan, quickly realized that the information produced by the global war, fought on multiple fronts and territories, needed to be painstakingly abstracted, graphically depicted and efficiently presented. The O.S.S. mission expanded to include not only information gathering through research and counterintelligence but also packaging and interpreting that information for the president and other key decision makers. Propaganda played a crucial role during World War II, with the O.S.S. leading efforts to demoralize the enemy and encourage resistance in Axis-controlled countries. They created a stamp bearing the face of Hitler rendered as a skull, produced radio broadcasts in German, spread pamphlets announcing a German general’s resignation and made films for new military recruits, such as the Hollywood producer Darryl F. Zanuck’s circa 1943 “Organization of the Army,” which was commissioned by General George C. Marshall. Through its manipulation of the art of information, the agency helped shape the look and philosophy of American imperialism. In doing so, the O.S.S. assembled a concentration of acumen and talent that rivaled those of the iconic schools and institutes that propagated design in the 20th century. It was the Bauhaus, but for war."

And a documentary about Mel Brooks airs on HBO.,"BUMBLEBEE (2018) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Many blockbuster prequels tell the origin story of a flesh-and-blood superhero or villain. This one tells the tale of a Volkswagen Beetle. Or, more precisely, it tells an origin story of a robot hero who can morph into a yellow car. That robot would be Bumblebee, once the metal partner of Shia LaBeouf’s character in the various Michael Bay “Transformers” movies. Bumblebee is here reimagined as the sidekick of a 1980s Northern California teenager played by Hailee Steinfeld. Together, the pair defends the earth from evil robots. This movie was directed by Travis Knight, a filmmaker who built his career on stop-motion animation. He cut back on some of the profuse chaos that defined the earlier “Transformers” films, working off a screenplay by Christina Hodson. The result, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times, is “cleverly plotted, neatly allusive and has dialogue you can envision real people and, um, real Transformers speaking.” It’s “springy yet coherent,” he added, “not, like previous films in the series, a digital-image blender set on high.”"

How to Spot a Counterfeit Watch,2019-12-17,article,News,,"['Counterfeit Merchandise', 'Watches and Clocks']",Get close. Is the second hand moving smoothly?

Altieri specializes in Rolexes, which almost always run on automatic movement, where the motion of a wearer’s wrist winds an intricate system of tiny gears and springs, resulting in a smoother, sweeping second hand. Altieri can make out a cheap quartz fake from five feet away, but recently he has seen more almost-perfect impostors, what he calls “superfakes.” To catch these, you need a 10x magnifying glass and lots of time. “It really helps if you have a real one right next to it to compare,” he says.

As a rock music fan, she strove to channel the D.I.Y. ethos laid out in the self-taught musician Viv Albertine’s 2014 feminist punk memoir “Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.” The resulting pieces — a collection of youthful, boldly hued knits made from merino and lamb’s wool and adorned with the knitted names of beloved bands such as Devo and Joy Division — quickly found a following on Instagram. Last year, Holland won the British Fashion Council’s Fashion Potential Award, and while the brand’s international profile is growing, she is committed to working with British and family-run businesses, both in the Pennine mountains of Yorkshire, where her yarn is milled, and in Hawick, Scotland, where her sweaters are crafted by hand. For recent collections, she has drawn inspiration from sources including Virginia Woolf’s 1925 novel “Mrs. Dalloway” (which prompted woven slogans like “melancholy” and “true self”) and the color combinations found on old covers of The Paris Review. This season, a holiday in Greece was her starting point: While in Athens this past summer, she recalls, “We stayed with friends in the historically anarchic suburb of Exarcheia.” The collection’s standout piece, the Carrington cardigan, plays with the same fusion of tradition and rebellion. The V-neck style comes in British postbox red, navy and black and fastens with oversize mythology-themed buttons: the heads of Aphrodite, Athena, Zeus and Medusa, 3-D-printed in resin."

Hindus, Christians, Jews and Muslims lived side by side and traded with the Arabs and Chinese long before the Portuguese fumbled their way over (it was Kerala that Columbus was after in 1492 when he found himself in the Bahamas instead) and established the first European settlement in India at Cochin in 1500, kicking off successive waves of colonization by the Portuguese, Dutch and British.

The new movie focuses on a different dog, Togo, and his trainer and musher (played by Dafoe). The story creates drama from a classic combination of heroism and harsh conditions. “It’s going to be bad,” Dafoe’s character says early in the film, sizing up the coming storm. How bad? “Memorable, I think.”"

After publication, Mr. Stephens and his editors learned that one of the paper’s authors, who died in 2016, promoted racist views.

In that sense, what makes Jews special is that they aren’t. They are representational.”"
