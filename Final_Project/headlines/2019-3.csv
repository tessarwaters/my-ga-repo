See How Margaret Atwood and Jonathan Lethem and More Draw a Bunny,2019-03-01,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],The writer Sabra Embury has spent a decade collecting 10-second drawings of rabbits from some of the most esteemed names in literature.,"I started this 10-second rabbit project a little over a decade ago as a way of channeling the artistic curiosity of the inspiring people around me. At parties I’d collect unsigned, loose-leaf doodles from people around a room, and then we’d guess who drew each based on our assumptions about one another. Like handwriting analysis, but with bunnies. Why bunnies? Because they’re tough to mistake for any other creature, thanks to the exaggerated stretch of their ears. They’re fun to draw even for people who possess no art skills at all. (Plus, imagine asking Jonathan Lethem to draw a chicken.) I later began asking authors at readings to sign their books with a rabbit, scrawled in 10 seconds or less. The time limit gave the whimsical scheme structure, and it also put participants at ease; I wasn’t asking for serious art. Still, they’d often protest, “I can’t draw!” before inevitably conceding, and eventually admitting they enjoyed the break from routinely asking to whom they should inscribe the book. Margaret Atwood, for one, embraced my request with a glow: “This is great!” she said, adding a carrot. Others (I’ve amassed 70 of these over the years), both reluctant and charmed, would sigh a “here goes” as I counted to 10."

Often cut from minerals such as jade and quartz, these implements have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine and represent the most basic form of natural skin care, says the New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Patricia Wexler. Lately, the options have expanded beyond the ubiquitous jade roller to include tools for gua sha, an ancient form of manual massage that involves “scraping” the edges of a flat stone along the meridians of the face with slow, firm movements. Doing so “can increase circulation, improve lymphatic drainage, de-puff eyes — and provide a calming effect,” says Dr. Wexler.

36 Hours in St. Augustine,2019-03-07,article,News,,['Travel and Vacations'],"On northern Florida’s Atlantic coast, the past is present in this centuries-old city, where history, beachcombing and Southern treats like butter pecan milkshakes are celebrated in equal measure.","If you think the Sunshine State is all about theme parks and frying on the beaches, you probably haven’t been to St. Augustine.

It’s also a distinctly American place where you can indulge in a butter pecan milkshake; explore the city’s 144-block Historic District on foot or bike; and, if you’re willing to step out of town for a few hours, play the imposing 17th island green that the world’s best golfers will navigate at the upcoming Player’s Championship in nearby Ponte Vedra Beach. The water at the city’s fabled Fountain of Youth might not transport you back to your salad days, but there’s enough magic on St. Augustine’s brick streets to make you a believer."

The result is the Galop d’Hermès, a range of sleek women’s watches, in either steel or rose gold (inlaid diamonds optional), with a stirrup-shaped face inspired by the luxury brand’s equestrian heritage. Archibong, 35, originally trained as an architect but is now best known for his work as a furniture and lighting designer, creating sculptural glass pendant lamps and curvy steel chairs with chubby upholstered seats. Four years ago, when he met Philippe Delhotal — the creative director of Hermès Horloger, the Paris-based company’s watch division — his career took another unexpected turn. Delhotal invited Archibong, then a recent graduate of the prestigious L’École Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne in Switzerland, to create a timepiece for Hermès, and the designer subsequently spent time in the brand’s private archives outside of Paris before developing the Galop, whose case evokes the aerodynamic curves of a racehorse."
