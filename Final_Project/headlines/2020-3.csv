I reached out to touch his cheek across a stretch of time. He didn’t stir."

Jenny Goldfarb, a vegan for nearly 10 years whose family was in the Jewish deli business in New York, decided that the taste of a hefty corned beef sandwich or a Reuben should not be on vegans’ no-fly list. She spent months in her kitchen experimenting with wheat, chickpeas, beets, tomatoes, spices, sweeteners and yeast, and finally, in 2018, began introducing the results in Los Angeles. Sarge’s Delicatessen & Diner in New York started serving her Mrs. Goldfarb’s Unreal Deli Corned Beef in January. It’s increasingly sold nationwide. The “meat” approximates the slightly crumbly texture of the real thing fairly well, and delivers its salty, somewhat smoky flavor. (It’s also kosher.) It’s a true departure from the usual burgers and sausages that vegan meat mimics. But what’s missing is the fat, especially for those, like me, who do not prefer lean corned beef. Thus, it’s best in a sandwich dressed with mustard and coleslaw or in a Reuben, in the company of gooey Russian dressing, melting vegan cheese and a moist layer of sauerkraut."

A Watch Brought Back From the Brink of Extinction,2020-03-10,article,News,,['Watches and Clocks'],"Zenith’s El Primero was once considered a mechanical marvel. Now, it’s achieved cult classic status.","The world’s first high-frequency automatic chronograph was introduced in 1969 by Zenith, a Swiss watchmaker founded more than a century before in the town of Le Locle. Unrivaled in timing precision (to one-tenth of a second) with a barrel-shaped tonneau case displaying a round dial with three charcoal-tinted subdials, the El Primero was considered a mechanical marvel; its chronograph module used an entirely integrated caliber, not just one bolted to an existing automatic movement. But the El Primero wasn’t on top for long: Just a few years later, quartz — an element that enabled watches to tell time even more accurately — threatened to make mechanical watches obsolete. Luckily, Zenith’s chronograph, along with the company, was saved when, in 1988, Rolex used the elegantly slender, self-winding caliber to power an updated version of its classic Daytona, which turned the movement into a cult favorite. Fifty years after El Primero’s debut, the company has released a timepiece that pays homage to the original 1969 model. Just two small tweaks were needed to bring it into the present: The hollow links of the original bracelet designed by the renowned Geneva firm Gay Frères have been rendered in solid steel; and there’s now a sapphire crystal caseback, the better to fixate endlessly on a timepiece that helped fine horology take a leap into the future. $8,200, zenith-watches.com."

What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Charlie Says’ and the Dixie Chicks,2020-03-12,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",A drama about the Manson cult airs on Showtime. And the Dixie Chicks perform on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”,"CHARLIE SAYS (2019) 9 p.m. on Showtime. Mary Harron vacillates between prison and movie ranch in “Charlie Says,” her drama about the Charles Manson cult. Though she is best known as the director of the satirical serial-killer study “American Psycho,” Harron here pays relatively little attention to Manson himself (played by Matt Smith), instead focusing on three of his female followers (played by Hannah Murray, Marianne Rendón and Sosie Bacon). That trio tells the story here. The movie shows them both during their time with Manson and after the fact, in prison, where they recount their story to a graduate student (Karlene Faith, played by Merritt Wever). “It’s a tough, difficult story that, anchored by Guinevere Turner’s script, Harron recounts with lucid calm, compassion and intelligent interpretive license,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “She revisits some of the familiar locations, including the dusty California ranch where the Manson family set up house, and she carefully restages some of the murders. For those familiar with the horrific details of those crimes, the movie may seem wholly uninviting, but bear with Harron — she has something to say.”"

An Exquisite Necklace That Recalls an Art-Deco Pioneer,2020-03-16,article,News,,['Jewels and Jewelry'],Cartier’s new Mauna necklace channels the combination of restraint and radiant excess brought to the house by the jewelry designer Jeanne Toussaint.,"When the designer Jeanne Toussaint, known for both her lithe, turbaned elegance and her lasting friendship with Coco Chanel, was named by Louis Cartier as head of jewelry design at his family-run company in 1933, her restrained yet vibrant pieces came to define a new era of Art Deco abstraction. While later she became known for her realistic depictions of flowers and animals, especially the house’s now iconic panther (her nick­name was La Panthère), in the early years, she explored geometric form and unusual gems. Among them was the rare pinkish-orange imperial topaz, mined in the 19th century in western Russia’s Ural Mountains, when only the czar’s family were allowed to wear the stones. This new necklace features three exquisite imperial topazes from Brazil, including a dangling 11-carat pear-cut bicolor stone with an ombré effect that shifts from fuchsia to Tuscan yellow.

How to Read Faster,2020-03-17,article,News,,['Reading and Writing Skills (Education)'],"It might be fine to skim through a user manual for an office printer, but don’t skim “Anna Karenina” and expect to understand it.","“There are no shortcuts,” says Elizabeth Schotter, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of South Florida, where she runs the Eye Movements and Cognition Lab. College-educated adults usually read between 200 and 400 words per minute (a comfortable listening rate is around 150 words per minute). The speediest speed readers claim as many as 30,000 words per minute, at which point research would suggest a significant loss of comprehension. It might be fine to skim through a user manual for an office printer, but don’t skim “Anna Karenina” and expect to understand it. “In this modern age, we always want to do everything faster,” says Schotter, whose lab uses high-speed video to analyze readers’ eyes as they dart across text. America’s speed-reading obsession confounds Schotter; on average, people read twice as fast as they can comfortably listen. Reading is visually and cognitively complicated; it’s OK to reread a line because it’s confusing or, better yet, to linger on a phrase so beautiful that it makes you want to close your eyes."

And the comedian Mae Martin stars in a new series on Netflix.,"BIG TIME ADOLESCENCE (2020) Stream on Hulu. Pete Davidson plays a role model with platinum blond hair and a taste for weed in this coarse coming-of-age comedy, the debut film of the writer-director Jason Orley. The plot centers on a brotherly relationship between Davidson’s character, a 23-year-old named Zeke, and Mo (Griffin Gluck), his ex-girlfriend’s 16-year-old younger brother, whom he walks through the finer points of the suburban slacker lifestyle. The story also involves small-time drug dealing and Mo’s pursuit of a crush (played by Oona Laurence). “Though Davidson, Gluck and Laurence show star potential, Orley either boxes them into a too-conventional coming-of-age arc or gives them cloyingly charming characteristics,” Kristen Yoonsoo Kim wrote in her review for The New York Times. “Despite some moments of tenderness and easy chemistry between Zeke and Mo,” Kim added, “‘Big Time Adolescence’ doesn’t have enough heart or humor to save it from becoming just another movie about white dudes bro-ing out.”"

Jackson play men who join forces to subvert discriminatory housing practices in this historical drama. Set primarily before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the film begins by introducing Bernard S. Garrett (Mackie), an African-American entrepreneur who moves to Los Angeles along with his wife, Eunice (Nia Long). There, Bernard meets Joe Morris (Jackson), a club owner with whom he teams up on an admirable scheme: Buying homes in white areas and renting them out to members of the city’s black middle class. They do that with the help of a somewhat guileless white colleague (played by Nicholas Hoult). The characters are based on real people. “It’s hard not to root for them even if they’re obvious and underdeveloped, burdened with dialogue that too often sounds programmatic rather than embodied,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The film, Dargis wrote, “uses laughs, white racism and black righteousness to soft-sell a tale of inequality, heroic capitalism and eye-drooping mathematics.”"

A British Shoe Designer’s Vase Collection,2020-03-20,article,News,,"['Glass', 'Design']","Nicholas Kirkwood’s first encounter with a blown-glass Ettore Sottsass piece six years ago ignited an ardor for their whimsical, childlike aesthetic.","“I once read that the Memphis movement was like a shotgun wedding between Bauhaus and Fisher-Price,” says the British shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood. His interest in Memphis — a design collective formed in 1981 that placed an emphasis on bold colors and wild abstraction — stems in part from a fascination with the boundary-pushing aesthetics of that decade. In particular, Kirkwood is drawn to the graphic glass vases made by Ettore Sottsass, the Italian industrial designer and father of the postmodernist movement. “I found my first Sottsass vase about six years ago in Paris,” he says. “I was struck by its shape and color — it resembled something a child might build.” Since then, the 39-year-old has amassed a collection of over a dozen vases. Several are assembled on a windowsill in his Soho studio to catch the light, and a few contain the sculptural flower arrangements he prefers from London’s Fjura. “Sottsass pieces may not be practical or classically beautiful, but they can really hold a room,” says the designer, whose spring collection is inspired by the relationship between architecture and nature in Los Angeles.

How to Run a Bath That Feels Like a Spa Treatment,2020-03-20,article,News,,"['Bathing and Showering', 'Beauty (Concept)', 'Salt', 'Water', 'Aromatherapy']",A roundup of ingredients — from pore-clearing black lava salt to soothing palmarosa oil — that can help transform a simple soak into a restorative escape.,"Bathing is among our oldest self-care rituals: The ancient Greeks regularly soaked their aching muscles after workouts at the gymnasium, and the Romans constructed elaborate thermae — multiroom public bathhouses — throughout their empire from 27 B.C. Today, the tubs might be more technologically advanced but the practice remains deeply soothing. “Sitting in water is the ideal environment for calming the mind and body,” says the New York-based facialist Nachi Kanemaru Glick, who grew up taking a nightly bath at her childhood home in Miyazaki, Japan. “The water helps ingredients penetrate the skin, the heat releases tension and it’s a quiet time for meditation and self-reflection.” Or as Deborah Hanekamp, a New York-based wellness expert and author of the book “Ritual Baths” (out March 24) puts it, “We all feel one way before we get in the bath, and then a bit better when we get out.” The right mix of products and atmosphere can easily elevate the average soak, says the British facialist Alexandra Soveral, who has a background in chemistry. Here, five restorative bath recipes to try at home — whether you want to refresh your skin, relax your muscles or simply unplug from the world outside right now."
