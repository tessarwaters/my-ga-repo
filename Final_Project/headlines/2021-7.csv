"Angie Mar’s Latest, Les Trois Chevaux, Opens",2021-07-06,article,News,,['Restaurants'],"A community-supported agriculture program puts down roots, Levantine cuisine in Chelsea, and more restaurant news.","Angie Mar is entering a new stage of her career with the opening of this elegant tribute to fine dining. “This is my restaurant, not something I inherited, and I was looking for fresh ideas,” she said. Previously, she was the chef and owner at the Beatrice Inn next door, which she acquired from Graydon Carter. (That restaurant closed this year, and Ms. Mar subsequently decided to open this new place instead of recreating the Beatrice.) Now, defying current restaurant norms — bare tables, no dress code, a burger on the menu — this venture features white napery beneath a chandelier that came from the Waldorf Astoria, a French menu that tilts classic and the requirement that men wear jackets (with a supply of vintage YSL on hand). Though Ms. Mar is known for her artistry with slabs of meat, she isn’t offering steak, preferring seafood and birds. “It’s a vast departure, but what I want right now,” she said. The prix-fixe menu ($185) will change frequently but digs deep into French tradition with frog legs and artichokes in beurre blanc, a mousse of veal brains with truffles, sweetbreads wrapped in cabbage, Dover sole with sorrel mousseline, pithiviers (a pastry dome) of crab, and roast pheasant for two. There will be a croquembouche for dessert. Her inspiration comes from chefs like André Soltner and Jacques Pépin; a painting by Mr. Pépin hangs near the bar. Except for a Hungarian Tokay, the wine list is all French and American, and the salonlike room seats 37, plus nine at the bar. Banquettes in inky blue, which Ms. Mar said was the color of her father’s favorite sweatshirt, contrast the creamy ivory of the walls, and touches of that shade show up in the staff’s Christian Siriano-designed outfits. The restaurant’s name, which translates to the three horses, is a nod to what her family called her and her two brothers. (Opens Thursday) "

There are stories about belonging: funny and moving essays about modern queer life, an emotional account of one woman’s experience as a Korean American and the biography of an author who was committed to showing Jewish life in America. Also: Quentin Tarantino turns his recent film about Hollywood history into a novel; a look at how the Federal Writers’ Project captured the country in the 1930s and ’40s; a year in the life of Serena Williams; an insider’s perspective on the contentious issues of law enforcement."

What inspired me most about the “Metamorphoses” (I read David Raeburn’s classic translation) is how vibrant and visual these stories are, and how Ovid captures human desperation and fragility.  In making these images I wanted to reflect on the idea of becoming something else. Ovid’s physical and emotional landscapes are constantly shifting. I wanted to visualize the feelings we are going through as we start to transform back into our normal lives, re-engaging with ourselves and with nature."

In a 1973 item about one of Cowley’s books, “Works and Days of the Lost Generation,” William Styron quoted his take on the shape and meaning of a literary legacy: “A generation is no more a matter of dates than it is one of ideology. A new generation does not appear every 30 years. … It appears when writers of the same age join in a common revolt against the fathers and when, in the process of adopting a new lifestyle, they find their own models and spokesmen.”"
