There exists no universal system for the successful impartation of certain values to children, because each child is a kind of hydra: Both adversaries wear down your tools and multiply the problems you think you’ve solved. The only method is improvisation to the point of exhaustion. You try things, those things generally fail, the kid somehow survives, you try slightly different things, ad infinitum, ad absurdum, until the kid finally outlasts the experiment that is your care. This, after too many after-school ‘‘talks’’ that turned into terrible lectures, is what drove me to the fables of Aesop this past spring."

How Ned Yost Made the Kansas City Royals Unstoppable,2015-10-01,article,News,,"['Baseball', 'Coaches and Managers', 'Statistics']",The most criticized manager in the major leagues dismissed metrics and embraced failure — and broke his team’s three-decade slump.,"The game in Detroit was tied in the bottom of the ninth, and Ned Yost needed a relief pitcher. As the manager of the Kansas City Royals, he had a formidable bullpen at his disposal. Kelvin Herrera, who throws 99 m.p.h., had already pitched the seventh inning, his usual assignment. He struck out all three batters he faced. Wade Davis, the master of a near-unhittable cut fastball, had done his job by pitching a scoreless eighth. That left Greg Holland, who has saved 116 games for the Royals over the past three seasons. Holland’s responsibility, as Yost saw it, was to finish games — but only when protecting a lead. Yost said repeatedly that he wouldn’t use Holland when his team is behind or tied. ‘‘Don’t look for me to do it,’’ he told the beat writers after one game last year. ‘‘I’m not going to do it.’’"

Losing her early New York friend and roommate, Robert Mapplethorpe, to AIDS in 1989. Her book is about moving from a time when her children were little and “the things I touched were living” (“my husband’s fingers, a dandelion, a skinned knee”) to a time when she increasingly began to capture and memorialize moments from her life in photos and words — to create, as an artist, talismanic souvenirs of the past.

The Hemingways were fresh off a luxury steamship from Oak Park, Ill., looking to chuck the suburban grind for the seasonal joys of lake country. For $400 they soon had a 20- by 40-foot clapboard cottage built that was short on nearly every amenity except peace and quiet.

Kazuo Kitai’s Record of a Japan in Transition,2015-10-01,article,Review,,['Photography'],Mr. Kitai’s photographs at the Miyako Yoshinaga gallery document protests and a disappearing way of life.,"Born in 1944, the Japanese photographer Kazuo Kitai made his mark when he was barely 20 for pictures he took of political demonstrations at the United States Navy base at Yokosuka. His work was radical at the time for its shaky snapshot style and for being shot from the point of view of a participant in the event. He pushed further in this direction when, in 1968, he embedded himself in a four-month student occupation of Nihon University in Tokyo. One of the characteristic images in this small, early career survey, of a roll of toilet paper hanging from ropes against a wall covered with broadly brushed graffiti, is a souvenir of that siege."

If he’s not more widely known today, it’s for complicated and not entirely unfair reasons. He was a good painter and, at times, an inspired one. But for most of his career, he was a facile imitator, bouncing back and forth across the Atlantic, spending a total of nearly 20 years sojourning, at different times, in Madrid and in Paris, where he studied with Courbet and hung out with Impressionist painters like Pissarro, Monet and Cézanne."

Photos That Highlight the Playfulness of a Religious Holiday,2015-10-01,article,News,,['Photography'],"Estelle Hanania’s new book, “Happy Purim,” documents celebratory costumes in one London neighborhood.","The photographer Estelle Hanania has long been interested in depicting ritual: her past projects have included “Parking Lot Hydra,” a series portraying a traditional Bulgarian masquerade aimed at banishing evil spirits, and “Glacial Jubilé,” an anthropological view of wintertime folk traditions throughout Europe. In her new book, “Happy Purim” (Shelter Press), the masks and costumes associated with the Jewish holiday serve to universalize Hanania’s subjects, emphasizing the universality of dressing up rather than the particularity of religious culture. To that end, Hanania visits and documents places that seem as though they could be anywhere — not just the London neighborhood of Stamford Hill where the photos were taken. Uninterested in establishing a specific location, the artist situates children dressed as kings, as elderly people and even as pizzas against generic backgrounds: brick walls, sidewalk blocks. These pictures put a surreal spin on family photographs, teasing out the contrasts between youth and adulthood, childhood and mortality, appearing and disappearing."

Slinging a Farah Fawcett-esque shag and an accent as thick (and sloppy) as a triple-decker sandwich, Ms. Moore plays Laurel Hester, an Ocean County detective who becomes headline news after she can’t secure her pension benefits for her lover, a mechanic, Stacie Andree (Ellen Page).

He’s looking at me funny!” school, which attributes US economic weakness to the way the Obama administration has created uncertainty, or hurt businessmen’s feelings, or something. As Furman shows, it’s a global slowdown, very much consistent with the “accelerator” model in which the level of investment demand depends on the rate of growth of overall demand."

Inside the List,2015-10-02,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Jenny Lawson writes about mental illness in her memoir “Furiously Happy,” No. 3 in hardcover nonfiction: “‘Just cheer up’ is almost universally looked at as the most unhelpful depression cure ever.”","The Best Medicine: Jenny Lawson’s second memoir, “Furiously Happy,” is subtitled “A Funny Book About Horrible Things,” and she’s not kidding. The book, which enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 3, is all about Lawson’s struggles with various forms of mental illness — clinical depression, panic attacks, a compulsion to pull out her own hair — and as unlikely as it might sound to anybody who hasn’t visited Lawson’s blog (or read her 2012 debut, “Let’s Pretend This Never Happened”), it’s also very, very entertaining. Here she is, for instance, discussing the fact that her first antidepressant led her to fixate on suicide, “which is sort of the opposite of what you want”: “Lots of concerned friends and family felt that the first medication’s failure was a clear sign that drugs were not the answer; if they were I would have been fixed. Clearly I wasn’t as sick as I said I was if the medication didn’t work for me. And that sort of makes sense, because when you have cancer the doctor gives you the best medicine, and if it doesn’t shrink the tumor immediately then that’s a pretty clear sign you were just faking it for attention.” Ouch. Later, she complains that “there is nothing more annoying than having someone tell you that everything would be fine if you were just a better pray-er,” and adds, “I can tell you that ‘Just cheer up’ is almost universally looked at as the most unhelpful depression cure ever. It’s pretty much the equivalent of telling someone who just had their legs amputated to ‘just walk it off.’ ” Lawson is obviously no fan of well-meaning platitudes, but her book at least proves the one about looking back on all of this and laughing."

The first is of Prof. E.K. Johnston of the University of Missouri, prosecuted for sodomy in 1948. The respected 50-year-old “lost his job, his good name, his beloved students, his entire career — even his pension.” The second depicts a ceremony for Army Col. Tammy Smith’s elevation to the rank of general in 2012.

What’s on TV Monday,2015-10-05,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Encore) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Fly fishing surged in popularity after Robert Redford’s visually stunning tale about a minister’s sons coming of age in Montana between Prohibition and the Depression — and finding expression for their emotions knee-deep in a rushing river. Craig Sheffer plays the introspective Norman Maclean, on whose 1976 autobiographical story this film is based; Brad Pitt is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother. “Between the novella’s well-known first sentence (‘In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing’) and its elegiac last line (‘I am haunted by waters’), ‘A River Runs Through It’ circled gracefully among the landmarks of Mr. Maclean’s early years without violating the distant perfection of those memories,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. It is easy to recognize Mr. Redford’s “reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love,” she added. “The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean — of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace — are ably reflected on the screen.”"

What’s On Television Friday,2015-10-09,article,News,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8:45 A.M.

He also seethes like the surly, violent alcoholic that Pollock was — upending dinner tables; raging at his wife, the painter Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden); and ultimately crashing his car with two female companions in what might have been a deliberate suicide run. Yes, the movie, which Mr. Harris also directed, “has flaws and inaccuracies,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “But ‘Pollock’ is for the most part admirable. It reminds us that great art isn’t about creating beauty out of misty-eyed Hallmark moments but about discovering and communicating messy truths that spill all over the place, just like the lives of the artists driven to uncover them.” (Image: Mr. Harris)"

Her characters tend to be so awash in ­troubles — drug addiction, alcoholism, poverty, injury, disease, broken mar­riages, sexual abuse — that survival becomes, by necessity, their main occupation. After Margo Crane, the teenage protagonist of Campbell’s mesmerizing 2011 novel “Once Upon a River,” is abandoned by her mother, is assaulted by an uncle and witnesses her father’s murder at the hands of a cousin, she gathers a rifle and a sleeping bag and takes off downstream in a wooden rowboat."

His 2002 dystopia “Feed” is an unnerving portrait of an information-overloaded, environmentally ravaged future. “The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing,” a National Book Award winner set in colonial Boston, follows a boy doubly exploited as an experimental subject and a slave. In “Symphony for the City of the Dead,” his first nonfiction work for teenagers, he takes on one of the grimmest chapters in world history. Following the relentless downward spiral of Soviet society under Stalin’s rule and German assault, he shows how one piece of music played a role that was, to different ears, redemptive, consoling and rousing."

Forty-five years on, Norman Mailer’s “Of a Fire on the Moon” from 1970 remains the most potent and poetic account of the first Apollo lunar landing, and Tom Wolfe’s “The Right Stuff,” released in 1979, offers unrivaled insight into the politics and personalities behind Project Mercury, the initial ramp-up to Apollo.

Trollope Uncut,2015-10-09,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']","A new, restored version of Trollope’s 1880 novel “The Duke’s Children” is a fuller, richer book.","Scholars are always fossicking around in libraries and emerging with the original manuscripts of novels supposedly superior to the mangled versions subsequently created by dimwitted editors. In 2000, for example, Matthew J. Bruccoli and his wife, Arlyn, convinced themselves that the suitcase-sized version of Thomas Wolfe’s “Look Homeward, Angel” was better before Maxwell Perkins did us all a favor and took his scissors to it. But now, just in time for the bicentennial of Trollope’s birth, there is a new, restored version of his 1880 novel “The Duke’s Children,” assembled by a team of researchers led by Steven Amarnick, who went back to the original manuscript in Yale’s Beinecke Library, and it really is better, even if for the time being it’s only available in a deluxe Folio Society edition — the kind of book, slipcased, gilded, finely bound, that’s so grand you’re a little embarrassed to be seen with it."

The wood might become ill and die, or the fairies might skip the wood altogether and leave a fairy-baby instead, carting the little human off for other purposes. Either way, there’s a particular kind of terror inherent in the situation: to look in a crib expecting to see one’s cooing infant and instead find something inert and unknown. Maurice Sendak’s picture book “Outside Over There” captures the horror with a rich gorgeousness, where the replacement baby is made of ice, and glows milky and terrifying and odd on the page. "

The job’s a game.” With brevity that few contemporary gamification gurus can equal, Poppins encapsulates the movement’s mantra. As the game designer Jane McGonigal argued in her 2011 pseudoscientific manifesto, “Reality Is Broken,” the most mundane task can be made palatable, even alluring, if framed not as a chore, but as a contest."

The high-energy fragments flung out by the missile perforated the plane’s nose and caused it to tear off, leading to the breakup and crash of the plane about a minute later, which killed all 298 passengers onboard."

It was an exhibition about landscape in general, organized to give the visitor the feeling of a hike through mountainous terrain. The photograph of the forest was near the entrance of the exhibition, and I had walked past it without stopping because it seemed to be simply another big photo, of which there are so many in museums these days.

What the photograph (titled ‘‘Clearing’’) showed was not a forest, but a model of a forest.

The model was illuminated by a powerful lamp, to mimic shafts of sunlight falling through the trees."

"Classical Playlist: Holliger, Pieczonka, Sivan Magen and More",2015-10-14,article,News,,[],Times critics share what they’ve been listening to lately.,"HOLLIGER: ‘Machaut-Transkriptionen’Muriel Cantoreggi, Jürg Dähler, Geneviève Strosser, viola; the Hilliard Ensemble(ECM)The music that preceded him is often the subject of Heinz Holliger’s composing — but mutated, hidden. This new disc focuses on Mr. Holliger’s project of “transcriptions” (2001-09) of pieces by the 14th-century composer Guillaume de Machaut. Machaut’s ballade “Biaute qui toutes autres pere” is translated from a cappella voices into airy, sun-shard harmonics for three violas; in Mr. Holliger’s version of another ballade, the original melody glints behind veils of new dissonances. Machaut’s “Hoquetus David” becomes Mr. Holliger’s sliding, plucking, tapping, ultimately chaotic “nach Hoquetus David,” and the new arrangement of Machaut’s seventh lay adds three new, duskily harmonizing vocal lines to the single surviving one. The cycle is capped with two extensive summations; the final “Complainte” brings together voices and violas in a melancholy outpouring. The transcriptions project has Mr. Holliger’s customary, total elegance, as well as a tenderness that reaches, composer to composer, across centuries. The performers are attentive and passionate, and the recorded sound vivid enough to capture the violists’ intakes of breath as they cue each other. (Zachary Woolfe)"

With equal parts childlike randomness and methodical precision, White’s collages represent not only a throwback to the cut-and-paste methods necessitated by analog photography, but also how modern a DIY technique can feel."

Al Pacino demonstrates as much in Sidney Lumet’s 1975 “Dog Day Afternoon” (reissued by Warner on the occasion of the film’s 40th anniversary in a two-disc Blu-ray edition), and so, to very different affect, does Gérard Depardieu in Abel Ferrara’s “Welcome to New York” (out on Blu-ray and DVD from IFC Films)."

Endowed with a voice of phenomenal beauty and flexibility, Ms. Monheit was hailed as potentially the next big thing in jazz more than 15 years ago, but with caveats. A formidable vocal technician, she often seemed disconnected from her material, content to make a gorgeous sound and execute tricky vocal improvisations that frequently came across as empty displays of virtuosity."
The Triumphant Return of Figurative Art,2015-10-15,article,News,,[],"At Frieze Art Fair in London, artists have taken a turn away from the abstraction that’s dominated the market for several years.","Piggybacking on a tendency many picked up on at the recently opened “Greater New York” exhibition at MoMA PS1 across the pond, a larger than usual number of figurative paintings are on view at the 13th annual Frieze Art Fair in London this week. Perhaps this represents a turn away from the “zombie formalism” micromovement — a pejorative term for the sort of gimmicky abstract products that have lately been pumped out by younger artists to satisfy the market’s taste. Or maybe it’s simply a shifted course, in service of expanding demand in another direction. Whether the cause is more commercial or more creative, one could speculate the change is indicative of global shifts that are afoot beyond the bubble of the art world. Three pieces in particular include strikingly spare, concise bodies drawn in gestural outlines: Camille Henrot’s light, raunchy jokes at the Parisian gallery Kamel Mennour; Jesse Wine’s forensic traces of discarded clothing painted on ceramic tile at London’s Limoncello; and at the New York gallery 47 Canal, Trevor Shimizu’s cartoonishly contented lady with child, a work whose emotional depth somehow transcends that of an emoji."

The most nuanced expression of this unending war can be seen in these stone faces.

After making its debut last week atop the hardcover fiction list, “The Murder House,” by James Patterson and David Ellis, slips to No. 3. This is the fourth collaboration between Patterson and Ellis, and the second, after last year’s “Invisible,” to hit No. 1. Patterson’s co-writers don’t often discuss their professional relationship, but in 2012 Ellis reflected on the lessons he’d learned from “Guilty Wives,” their first team effort. “I always felt like Jim was doing more than collaborating with me on a novel,” Ellis wrote on his website. “He was trying to teach me, too. And it was always about the reader. It’s not about winning writing awards (though he has won plenty). It’s not about how impressively you display all the research you’ve amassed. It’s not about the number of syllables in your flowery description. The only question is, how will the reader respond? If it heightens the drama for the reader — because it makes you love the protagonist or hate the villain; . . . because it tears at your heart; because it turns your expectations upside down — then it belongs in the book. Jim always preaches, never miss an opportunity to maximize the drama. Why speak quietly when you can shout? Why quietly acquiesce to misfortune when you can lash out? Why jab a finger when you can throw a punch? Why throw a punch when you can engage in a high-speed shootout? Why a soft kiss and not a sizzling romp in bed? Turn. Up. The. Heat. And then, when you’ve turned up the heat as high as you can — turn it up higher.”"

In 1999 worldwide revenue was $27 billion, and it looked like nothing but blue sky ahead. John Seabrook’s well-researched new book about the industry covers the sharp downward slope that followed. The people I knew combed the country looking for the next hit makers and chatted with global conglomerates about acquisitions and weekended in the Hamptons, with no idea that the end of the party was right around the corner. That their industry was going to contract so much that in 2014 worldwide revenue would be $15 billion, not much more than half of what it had been at its peak.

The Fabulously Quirky World of Wes Anderson’s Partner,2015-10-19,article,News,,"['Interior Design and Furnishings', 'Books and Literature', 'Design', 'Fashion and Apparel']","With Juman Malouf’s romantic Mitteleuropean sensibility, the Lebanon-born designer and costumer starts a new chapter as an author and illustrator.","‘‘IT’S QUITE POWERFUL to be from nowhere,’’ says the designer-turned-author Juman Malouf. Born in Beirut, raised in Saudi Arabia and London, educated at Brown University and now splitting her time between Paris and New York with her partner, Wes Anderson, the 40-year-old has parlayed her perspective as a peripatetic outsider into a charming new novel aimed at middle-schoolers, ‘‘The Trilogy of Two.’’ The lavishly illustrated fable of twin orphans growing up in a traveling circus in what Malouf calls a ‘‘futuristic Dickensian world’’ was inspired by personal touchstones ranging from Charlotte Brontë to August Sander to her superstitious grandmother who believed in fortune-telling, and reflects Malouf’s distinctive sense of style, which seems vaguely late Victorian but ultimately unmoored to a time or place. A former fashion designer (she co-founded the early-aughts cult label Charlotte Corday) and theater costumer, she favors prim vintage dresses, faded florals and a signature half-pinned hairstyle she describes as ‘‘messy 1940s.’’ She could easily fit, unadulterated, into a quirky Anderson production, giving Margot Tenenbaum a run for her money, and is the perfect foil for the 46-year-old director, with his bespoke tweeds and Wildean pageboy."

A New San Francisco Boutique for Fashion-Starved Locals,2015-10-19,article,News,,['Fashion and Apparel'],Anaïse — an online shop beloved for its stock of clothes by cult designers — opened a store in the Mission this week.,"For a city ostensibly fixated on the future, San Francisco offers a retail fashion scene so safe it can seem retrograde.

A refined black alligator strap is attached to vintage-style lugs, and instead of the traditional individual pushers placed at 2 and 4 o’clock, they are combined in a single sleek unit within a crown so regal it looks as though it could be trimmed in ermine. The effect? Highly functional anti-bling to make the hearts of watch connoisseurs beat faster."

After his girlfriend turned him in to the police, Timothy Foster confessed to the crime. Foster lived in a housing project a few blocks from his victim. He was 18 and black. She was 79 and white. Choosing the jury that would decide whether Foster deserved to be executed, the prosecutors sent home four potential black jurors. They gave reasons that they said were unrelated to race, as the Supreme Court requires, but that seem unconvincing.

But so did a white woman who was asked to sit on the jury, which, in the end, was entirely white."

Consider this summer’s financial and critical antipodes, ‘‘Fantastic Four’’ and ‘‘Inside Out.’’ While Fox’s live-action outing, about a crew of remarkably good-looking mutants out to save the world, sputtered to a near-historic loss, the latter was a runaway success — a brainy, irresistible family film that was not only the year’s creative high-water mark but also the eighth consecutive Pixar effort to gross over $500 million worldwide. But it’s not just eye-popping ticket returns that are bolstering the genre: Near-limitless licensing potential (see: Universal’s ubiquitous ‘‘Minions,’’ not to mention Disney’s merchandising juggernaut ‘‘Frozen’’) coupled with expanded potential in the international market — along with flexible hours and generous pay for celebrity voice actors — have made animation one of the only sure bets in Hollywood."

How to Catch a Baseball in the Stands,2015-10-23,article,News,,['Baseball'],Stay on your feet. Study the lineup.,"‘‘Wear a glove,’’ says Zack Hample, who caught his first major-league ball as a 12-year-old at Shea Stadium in 1990 and has since collected 8,616 balls at 51 ballparks. Think of yourself as a way-out-there outfielder. Sometimes, Hample is on his feet the whole game, scampering back and forth in the bleachers from left field to right. Don’t stay in your ticketed seat unless you have to. Seek out designated standing areas or move to an aisle seat in a sparsely populated row. ‘‘Lateral mobility is key,’’ Hample says. In the off-season, he writes books about baseball and works at Argosy, his family’s Manhattan bookstore. During the season, he traverses the country as a so-called ball hawk, snagging balls that he stores in giant plastic barrels in his mother’s basement. (Highlights have included Alex Rodriguez’s 3,000th-career-hit ball and the first major-league home run hit by Mike Trout, the reigning American League M.V.P.)"

While it’s popular in publicity to focus on the life experience that informs a book, a writer’s art experiences are just as responsible for how a story emerges from the imagination and eventually appears on the page.

Our country’s first black head of state has already, of course, come alive on the pages of his own books, as well as in a growing cottage industry of unauthorized portraits, from the paranoid to the all-but-­exhilarated. But another, perhaps higher, test of any cultural figure’s staying power is how well he fares in the realm of the purely or partly imaginative. “Grant Park,” the third novel from the Pulitzer Prize-winning, nationally syndicated Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts Jr., might be best understood as an early salvo in the effort to encase Barack Obama in the amber of lasting literature."
Poetic and Lifelike Botanical Sculptures,2015-10-23,article,News,,"['Art', 'Flowers and Plants']",The artist Carmen Almon has an an uncanny ability to subtly transform natural objects into art.,"‘‘EVERY PLANT NEEDS a system to grow, but there is also that X factor, something wonderful and wild that messes with the symmetry and balance,’’ says the 65-year-old American artist Carmen Almon. ‘‘That little bit of mystery is what’s real to me.’’ It is Almon’s ability to capture organic quirks that makes her botanical sculptures so remarkably lifelike and at the same time uncanny, existing just beyond the borders of the natural. Delicately rendered from the least delicate of materials (copper sheeting, brass tubing) and colored with enamel paint — they’re an adaptation of the tole style traditionally used to decorate metal lamps and trays. Almon’s wildflowers, weeds and vegetable plants are inspired by the abundant greenery that surrounds her country home in southwestern France and by her collection of detailed 17th- and 18th-century botanical drawings, as well as her own imaginings. Her unique creations have captivated a small but discerning set of collectors including Deeda Blair, Carolina Herrera and interior designer Howard Slatkin, for whom Almon worked as an art director in the 1980s, painting everything from silk fabrics to furniture. It was during this era that Blair, a client of Slatkin’s, asked Almon to restore a metal flower sculpture by the late Chicago artist Mary Munnecke — and so introduced her to the world of tole."

"‘The Tsar of Love and Techno,’ by Anthony Marra",2015-10-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],These interconnected stories revolve around the residents of a downtrodden industrial town in Russia.,"The most vivid character in “The Tsar of Love and Techno,” Anthony Marra’s new story collection, is not a person but a place, specifically the Russian city of Kirovsk, an arctic purgatory of nickel smelting plants, where one out of every two residents contracts lung cancer. In Marra’s Kirovsk there’s a polluted man-made lake surrounded by a dozen smokestacks that locals have named the Twelve Apostles; more memorable still is the White Forest, a field of metal and plastic birches planted in Soviet times by the local party boss’s wife, to combat the city’s reputation as an eyesore. Everything about the place reeks of disaster, even the name: Sergei Kirov was a Bolshevik whose assassination — probably on Stalin’s orders — became a pretext for the show trials of the 1930s. And since Marra’s preoccupation is history, and its ability to both erase and lend meaning to individual lives, Kirovsk is a fitting centerpiece for his audacious, strange and occasionally brilliant book."

You will, however, be able to find stories about Sherlaw Kombs, and Solar Pons, and Picklock Holes, and Shamrock Jolnes, and Warlock Bones and (my own pick of the pseudo-Holmeses) Hemlock Jones, who in Bret Harte’s “The Stolen Cigar-Case” almost destroys the ardently worshipful Watson-like narrator with the sheer puissance of his intellect. On Hemlock Jones’s shelves are glass jars containing “pavement and road sweepings” and “fluff from omnibus and road-car seats.” When he thinks, his head shrinks, “so much reduced in size by his mental compression that his hat tipped back from his forehead and literally hung on his massive ears.” Jones’s diamond-­encrusted cigar case, a present from the Turkish ambassador, has gone missing. There can be only one culprit: the narrator himself! Jones lays out the case, deduction by damning deduction. “So overpowering was his penetration,” declares the narrator in a fit of purest proto-Kafka, “that although I knew myself innocent, I licked my lips with avidity to hear the further details of this lucid exposition of my crime.”"

"‘John le Carré: The Biography,’ and Frederick Forsyth’s ‘The Outsider’",2015-10-26,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",A biography of John le Carré and a memoir by Frederick Forsyth explore their shared history in intelligence.,"David Cornwell, known to us as John le Carré, spent five and a half years in Britain’s secret services — two years in MI5 (domestic security, roughly equivalent to the F.B.I.), a “dead-end sort of place” from which he then transferred to the more glamorous MI6 (overseas intelligence). He had also done some intelligence work at Oxford and, earlier, Bern (tracking students attending left-wing meetings). Few writers have made better use of on-the-job training. The secret service has been source material for a long line of novelists, but it was le Carré who made it a permanent part of the literary landscape, giving us a fictional world so convincingly imagined that even its real-life inhabitants began to confuse the two, adopting his invented argot — “the Cousins,” “scalp­hunters,” “lamplighters,” “mole,” etc. — as their own. So blurred did these lines become that the Oxford English Dictionary had to conduct a lengthy usage search before deciding that “mole” had indeed been popularized in “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.” His 23 books have sold millions of copies, and 10 have been filmed. Anyone writing about espionage is invariably compared with him. The debate, often fueled by commercial envy and mandarin snobbery, about whether he is a genre writer who “transcends” the genre or a serious writer of distinction is by now so tired as to be pointless. He is by any standard one of the important literary figures of the postwar period."

Classical Playlist: ‘Poetry in Music’ and Gilles Vonsattel,2015-10-28,article,News,,['Music'],Times critics share what they’ve been listening to lately.,"‘POETRY IN MUSIC’The Sixteen; Harry Christophers, conductor(Coro)In the liner notes for this rewarding album of 14 a cappella vocal works, Harry Christophers, the conductor of the vocal ensemble the Sixteen, wonders what composers would do without poets and dramatists. Usually, he writes, the better the text, the more inspired the composer. But actually, certain great poems resist musical settings. Music has to be able to add something. But the British composers represented here, covering five centuries, all chose distinguished texts and responded with extraordinary music. William Harris’s 1925 anthem for double chorus “Faire is the Heaven” (an Edmund Spenser poem), which opens the album, conveys the text through surging, intensely mystical music with effective back-and-forth exchanges. Tippett’s “Dance, clarion air” (words by Christopher Fry), unfolds with stabbing chords and jumpy repetitions, sounding almost giddy. The program is built around four austerely poignant settings by Tudor- and early-Stuart-era composers (Thomas Weelkes, Robert Ramsey, Michael East and Thomas Tomkins) of “When David Heard,” from the Biblical story of the slaying of Absalom. Britten’s remarkable “Hymn to Saint Cecilia” (words by Auden) is the longest piece here. There are also exceptional works by Edmund Rubbra, Herbert Howells and others. The performances are beautiful and brilliant. (Anthony Tommasini)"

Stephen King’s ‘The Bazaar of Bad Dreams’ and More,2015-10-29,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"To a surprising extent, King tries to play it straight in his new collection.","There are two dogs in Stephen King’s fat new collection, THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS (Scribner, $30). Both of them die. You expect there to be a certain amount — well, a lot — of death in a King book, and he does his best, as ever, to deliver the mortal goods. What’s unusual about the tales in this volume is how many of its deaths are ordinary, mundane sorts of demises: deaths by cancer or heart failure or car accident or simple, non-­supernatural homicide. Sure, in “Mile 81,” the long, nearly self-parodic horror story that kicks off the book, a few people are sucked into a mysteriously voracious station wagon at an abandoned rest stop, and some, in later yarns, meet their ends with the help of otherworldly agencies: a sand dune on which the names of the soon to be dead are written, a “bad little kid” who doesn’t age and who drives his victims to suicide — that kind of Kingian thing. But to a surprising extent King tries to play it straight in this collection. And that seems to make him a little nervous. (His readers know how it feels.)"

Many adults will recall its whimsical premise, delivered with a poker face: A peddler who “was not like an ordinary peddler” carries a very tall stack of caps on his head: first his own checked cap, then a bunch of gray, brown, blue and red ones. We see him walking through an empty village — it looks like an old southern European town during siesta time — then taking a stroll out to the country, “slowly, slowly, so as not to upset his caps.” He naps sitting upright under a tree and awakens to find his wares gone. Up in the branches, monkeys are wearing the caps. Shaking his finger at them, he tells them to give back the caps. They shake their monkey fingers right back at him. The monkeys imitate him each time he makes his demand, until finally, in disgust, he throws his own checked cap to the ground. The monkeys, of course, do the same, and he is able to retrieve his caps, restack them on his head, and walk back to town."

Consumer groups, along with national and international health groups, urged Mexico’s Senate to restore the full tax, which it did Thursday, and the lower house quickly followed suit. By leaving the tax in place, Mexico “assured that this tax will remain a model for similar measures in the U.S. and around the world,” said former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York., whose philanthropy supports the Mexican groups that pushed for the tax. "

(Reviewing the series opener last year in the Book Review, Maureen Johnson described it as a sort of “X-Men” set in the 1300s.) Lu is something of a young elite herself — all five of her novels have been best sellers since her debut, “Legend,” hit the list in 2013, when Lu was 28. But until she was a teenager, she recently acknowledged, she didn’t understand that actual people had written the stories she loved. “In my head, I thought books were just spat out of factories somewhere,” she told a school in Manila last year, according to The Philippine Daily Inquirer. Lu, who was born in China and immigrated to America with her family shortly after the Tiananmen Square massacre when she was 5, told students at the International School Manila that witnessing the Tiananmen protests had influenced her writing and that she often researched real-life political horrors before turning to her dystopian novels. “There is no utopian country, and that is the way the world is,” she said.

"‘Wilkie Collins,’ by Peter Ackroyd",2015-10-30,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']","Wilkie Collins made his name with dark, crime-tinged tales. ","Alcohol and drug abuse are leitmotifs of writers’ lives and work, from ­Thomas De Quincey’s “Confessions of an English Opium Eater” to Caroline Knapp’s “Drinking: A Love Story.” As Peter ­Ackroyd shows in his study of a Victorian writer who was a major creator of the detective novel, Wilkie Collins could have taken on all comers. At one point, the author of “The Woman in White” and “The Moonstone” consumed, in a single glass, enough laudanum (a potent combination of opium and alcohol) to kill 12 people. He loved cigars, drank heavily — preferably brut Champagne — and usually ate rich French food.

This event will carry intense meaning for Aaron throughout the novel: “It seemed he had been waiting his whole life to save this boy.” For until Walter’s arrival in his life, Aaron himself was a child in desperate need of rescue. He remembers imagining his bed as a boat tossed by violent weather: “In the midst of the storms, he would throw himself from the bed to the floor, where he pretended that he was swimming, staying afloat and saving his own life because there was nobody else to save him.” When he tells Walter he’s leaving, Walter says reproachfully, “I saved you, Aaron.” Indeed, Aaron leaves partly because he has learned that being saved entails debts he is no longer willing to pay."
