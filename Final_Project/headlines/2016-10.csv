Sarah Jessica Parker Returns to HBO With ‘Divorce’,2016-10-05,article,News,,['Television'],"But don’t expect Carrie Bradshaw in the suburbs. This time, Ms. Parker plays a woman navigating a failing marriage.","Twelve years after the women of “Sex and the City” swilled their last cosmos, Sarah Jessica Parker is returning to HBO with a new series — one that might suggest her alter ego’s long-awaited “I love you” didn’t work out quite as planned. But don’t expect Carrie Bradshaw in the ’burbs. In “Divorce,” debuting at 10 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 9, Ms. Parker plays Frances, an arty type turned corporate recruiter navigating marital purgatory in Westchester County with her husband, Robert (Thomas Haden Church), a flailing real-estate developer, and their two children. But when a friend’s 50th-birthday party turns amusingly violent, life’s niggling disappointments explode into vivid relief, and some serious navel-gazing ensues. The show’s title pretty much sums it up as Frances and Robert deal with each other’s infidelities — hers physical, his emotional — and the flatlining of their union, and conclude that they’re better off apart. If only they could make a clean break. The discourse, achingly knowing and bracingly comical, will ring familiar to fans of Amazon’s “Catastrophe” and its gloriously sniping Sharon Horgan, this series’s creator."

The year before, Mel Gussow of The New York Times described him as part of a wave of young, politically righteous dramatists, and since then, Mr. Hare has grown into the role of liberal drama’s éminence grise. “Plenty,” a time-jumping drama, remains not only one of his finest and most popular plays but also one of the great modern vehicles for ambitious actresses. The four-time Tony nominee Kate Nelligan originated the role (an English secret agent, who worked for the French resistance, adjusting to a tepid postwar life), which has now been played by Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett. Part of the fun of the new revival, once again at the Public, will be to see how Rachel Weisz follows in their footsteps. David Leveaux directs. (publictheater.org, 212-967-7555.)"

But the facts are otherwise, as “The Witness,” an effective documentary released in June that follows Ms. Genovese’s brother Bill as he investigates the crime, proved. The popular belief that neighbors ignored her cries, a notion, based on police claims, reported in a New York Times article at the time (and since reconsidered by the paper), was an exaggeration.

Trump, through sheer dint of his own bluster, has conducted his own version of this exposé. By forcing blue-state liberal types to reckon with a demographic they had long dismissed as a punch line — low-income, uneducated whites in economically depleted regions — he awakened them to the fact that the groovy progressive social values they had assumed were a national fait accompli were actually only half the story."

They hold a beauty and a sadness — seasonally, of course, from those early sprouts pushing through the softened earth of spring, to the autumn, when the leaves fade and fall and the barrenness of winter sets in, but also in their impermanence. Gardens continually remind us of our mortality."

Kerry James Marshall Is Shifting the Color of Art History,2016-10-17,article,News,,"['Art', 'Race and Ethnicity']","For more than 40 years, the Chicago-based artist has made it his mission to paint black figures into the canon.","WE COULD BEGIN IN Birmingham, Ala., where the artist Kerry James Marshall was born in 1955, his father a postal worker whose hobby was buying broken watches, fancy ones — Baume & Mercier, Piaget, Patek Philippe — that he’d pick up in pawn shops for a song, figure out how to fix with the help of books he’d find used, and resell. From that story, we could derive the practical idea that Marshall, a companion on his father’s expeditions from a very early age, saw that something rarefied and complex, in which one had zero training, could be approached, deconstructed and — with education and application — mastered. Or we could begin by talking about Marshall’s older brother, Wayne — one year and nine days older, who, straight out of high school, went to work for the post office like his father and worked there until he retired — Wayne who was always first at everything, whom Marshall was always chasing, from whom he was inseparable except at school where their ages kept them in different grades, Marshall trying to catch up but always falling short, one year and nine days short. From that story, we could understand that Marshall is a man who, from the beginning, has been hustling to get to where he wants to go. Or we could begin in Watts, in 1963, when Marshall was 7, when his family moved there in time for the riots, 12 blocks from the Black Panther headquarters, a neighborhood where he learned things you’re not supposed to know about when you’re a kid. We could talk about how their mailman, a really nice guy, got killed on Marshall’s best friend’s front porch, in a robbery gone wrong, two doors down. How, on another day, coming home from school, cutting through the alley he always cut through, he found three grown women rolling around in the grass of a front yard, stab wounds all over them, stabbed by a young man who’d been discharged from the Army with problems, a man who’d just stabbed his mother, his aunt and his grandmother 70 times. And how, later, when Marshall was voted homecoming king of Jefferson High and was on his way there in his suit for the first homecoming parade in a decade — Jefferson having gotten kicked out of the conference because there’d always been problems — he arrived to find everybody heading the other way: Three people had just been shot on the field, friends of his. That was the kind of world Marshall grew up in, a world where he knew founding members of the Crips, and where a lot of the people he knew are now dead of unnatural causes and have been for a long time. From those stories, we’d be amazed to learn — as he told me in August when I visited him on the South Side of Chicago where he’s been making one masterpiece after another for three decades — that “it didn’t stop me from developing the sense that, still, everything is possible. I was never in despair.”"

The Renaissance Artifact Collections That Are Back in Style,2016-10-20,article,News,,"['Art', 'Museums', 'Collectors and Collections']","Wunderkammers were once a way for scholars and aristocrats to show off their impressive objects.

Over time, the practice of collecting items for one’s “wunderkammer” (“cabinet of wonders”) became more and more elaborate. Kings would gift extraordinary objects to other rulers to impress them with their wealth, such as a windup automaton that poured wine or a boat carved of gold and set with hundreds of precious stones. Perhaps one of the world’s greatest collections, which still exists, is the Green Vault, the treasure chamber of August the Strong, which reopened to the public in Dresden in 2004 and contains thousands of objects, from a cherry stone carved with over a hundred faces to the largest green-hued diamond in the world."

To judge from the genial, disarming tone of his memoir, “A Life in Parts” (new at No. 9 on the hardcover nonfiction list), that journeyman experience has given him the perspective to stay humble in the face of fame — or at least to maintain a sense of humor about it. “I’ve seen ‘Breaking Bad’ T-shirts in cities and little outposts all over the world,” he writes toward the end of the book. “People dress as Walter White for Halloween. They dress their children and dogs in hazmat suits and Heisenberg hats. People have shaved my face into the back of their heads, they’ve inked it on their backs, their forearms, their legs, their asses. I’m the permanent resident of some guy’s left butt cheek. Next to Larry and Moe. I suppose I’ve taken the place of Curly, the third Stooge. It’s a little . . . odd to have your face tattooed on someone’s backside. I did not see that coming when I lied about my ability to mountaineer in order to get a Mars bar commercial.” Fame has other pitfalls, too, Cranston adds. “As an actor you need to be sensitive, to be open, to be able to observe people and study human behavior,” he writes. “But as a celebrity I am no longer the observer, I am the observed. I am not the one who knocks. I am the one who ducks and covers.”"

Creep or Craftsman? Alfred Hitchcock Was Both,2016-10-28,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Movies']",Peter Ackroyd’s life of Alfred Hitchcock reveals the vulnerabilities beneath the calculating exterior.,"These are good times for Alfred Hitchcock. The refurbishment of the director’s reputation, which began in 1966 when François Truffaut published his landmark book of interviews, “Hitchcock/Truffaut,” reached its conclusion in 2012 when the film critics polled by Sight and Sound voted “Vertigo” the greatest film of all time, kicking Orson Welles’s “Citizen Kane” from a top spot it had enjoyed for decades. Wellesians bit their knuckles, and the rest of us scratched our heads. “Vertigo” is not Hitchcock’s best, but rather, with its lush morbidity, somnolent pace, poor box office and relative scarcity of jokes, the Hitchcock film for those who most wish he were French.

That one might bite into one’s mallard or grouse and land on stray birdshot is perhaps a badge of honor, proof that what’s on your plate has a woodsier back story than the steak. And palombe, or wood pigeon, has a better back story than most. “As a chef, you want something that tastes delicious, but also that’s coherent and has its own tradition,” says Daniel Rose, who serves it rare-roasted at his First Arrondissement restaurant Spring during the bird’s month-and-a-half season from mid-October to the end of November. Generally grayer than its close cousin, the standard pigeon, with distinctive white marks on its neck and wings, the wild-caught palombe is more delicately gamy and less rich. Rose serves his with braised foie gras and cabbage, and a purée of smoked beet. At L’Ami Jean, Stéphane Jégo goes a more traditional route, roasting the birds with thyme and garlic, or stewed in salmi, a mixture of giblets, wine and foie gras. “Wild palombe brings a rustic, old-fashioned moment to the table,” Rose notes. “It evokes the deliciousness of nature and cooking on an open fire.”"
