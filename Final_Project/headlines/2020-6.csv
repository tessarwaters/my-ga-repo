Sandberg directed) adhere to the heroic template, which means there’s a regulation villain (the reliably watchable Mark Strong) with schemes,” she added. “But they also fill in the faces and places, and add enough shading and color to Billy’s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens, it feels as if something more than the box office is at stake.”"

Though Cohn played many prominent roles, much of his personal life was veiled from public view. He was thought to be gay, despite his opposition to homosexuality, and he died from AIDS in 1986.

How to Shape Your Eyebrows at Home,2020-06-18,article,News,,"['Eyebrows', 'Cosmetics and Toiletries']","A guide to trimming, tweezing and touching up your arches on your own, with some creative direction from the experts.","Eyebrows have been a subject of obsession for centuries. During the Tang dynasty in China, women painted their brows to resemble the wings of butterflies, and in the Middle Ages, Europeans plucked every last hair to achieve what was considered a youthful-looking bare forehead. Our arches are no less important today and indeed seem to have become newly conspicuous during the past several months, exposed above our face masks or reflected back at us during Zoom calls. “I consider eyebrow grooming to be an art, and there are many ways of going about it,” says Jimena Garcia, a brow sculptor and specialist at Atelier Beauté Chanel in New York City, who, along with many others in her field, has started offering virtual consultations for clients. But no matter how advanced your instruction, fine-tuning your brows at home requires a bit of firsthand experience — and restraint (the temptation to over-pluck is the greatest challenge, Garcia cautions). In the end, the result should be both an expression of your personal style and a shape that best complements your features, she says. Here, an expert guide to brow pruning."
