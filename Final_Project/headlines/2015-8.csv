And a blood bath, literal and figurative, ensues. “For all its dexterity and assurance, the movie has its share of false notes and rhythmic stumbles,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “A few plot twists test the limits of credibility. And there is something a little dispiriting — if sadly unsurprising — about the way Mr. Chazelle turns a historically African-American art form into the existential arena for a couple of white guys.” Still, he added, “the battle of master and disciple is exciting and terrifying to witness, and, at its best, the film can feel as wild and spontaneous, as risky and precise, as a live jam session.”"

"‘The Beautiful Bureaucrat,’ by Helen Phillips",2015-08-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This debut novel explores existential questions through the experiences of an administrative worker.,"In the opening pages of Camus’s “The Stranger,” a nurse warns Meursault to keep a steady pace during his mother’s funeral procession: “If you go slowly,” she says, “you risk getting sunstroke. But if you go too fast, you work up a sweat and then catch a chill inside the church.” Meursault’s response conveys his overwhelming, and baffling, sense of imprisonment: “She was right. There was no way out.” It’s an illustrative moment of the paralysis — damned if I do, damned if I don’t — that characterizes so much of existential literature: Vladimir and Estragon, waiting for a God who never shows; the man from the country in the parable told by the priest in Kafka’s “The Trial,” inert, cursing his fate and praying to fleas, waiting for the doorkeeper to admit him into the Law; Gregor Samsa, trapped between identities, unable to leave his house or return to his human condition. This existential paralysis emerges, in part, from spiritual crisis: If God is dead, what is the individual’s role in an essentially meaningless universe? Are we pawns in the thrall of bureaucratic (Kafka) or totalitarian (Orwell) systems? Or are we, in fact, the ones with ultimate power; the arbiters — even unknowingly — of life and death?"

Russell. Patricia Arquette (above right, with, from left, Josh Brolin, Ms. Leoni, Mr. Stiller and Richard Jenkins) plays Mel’s wife, who is just getting her sexual footing back after the birth of their son and doesn’t like Tina’s flirty ways.

She nags a lot and likes to show off her body. “I want you to consider my age and ask yourself how I maintain this,” she declares, lifting her sweater. Writing in The Times, Janet Maslin called the film a “wonderfully mad odyssey of a movie,” adding that “thanks to this filmmaker’s fine comic acumen, the payoff is always there.” In “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” (2013), at 8 on Cinemax, Mr. Stiller, who also directed this adaptation of the James Thurber short story, stars as Walter, a dutiful drone in the photography department of Life magazine, who finds himself in a caper beyond his wildest imagination when the negative for the publication’s final print edition goes missing. Kristen Wiig plays the crinkly-nosed co-worker on whom Walter has a crush; Adam Scott is the leader of the new tech-jerk bosses who have Walter’s job on the line; and Sean Penn is the mysterious photographer behind Walter’s travels to Iceland, Afghanistan and other stunning far-off places. “Though it is a celebration of modesty, there is also quite a lot of vanity in ‘The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,’ ” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. There is also a contradiction: “An ordinary fellow should not have to be quite so special to win our admiration.” "

"June’s Book Club Pick: ‘The Fifth Season,’ by N.K. ­Jemisin",2015-08-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this novel, civilization faces destruction and the world itself is an enemy.","Fantasy novels often provide a degree of escapism: a good thing, for any reader who has something worth escaping. Too often, though, that escape comes through a fictional world that erases rather than solves the more complex problems of our own, reducing difficulty to the level of personal struggle and heroism, turning all obstacles to monsters we can see and touch and kill with a sword. But N.K. ­Jemisin’s intricate and extraordinary world-­building starts with oppression: Her universes begin by asking who is oppressing whom, what they are gaining, what they fear. Systems of power stalk her protagonists, often embodied as gods and primeval forces, so vast that resistance seems impossible even to contemplate. When escape comes in her novels, it is not a merely personal victory, or the restoration of a sketchy and soft-lit status quo. Her heroes achieve escape velocity, smashing through oppressive systems and leaving them behind like shed skins."

Alfred Prufrock’’ are fixed in a precise location: the cluttered space of my teenage bedroom floor. It’s 1982. The light is low. The parquet tiles are coming unglued. Album covers — Talking Heads, David Bowie, the Clash — fan out around me, and an array of paperbacks sprawl among a week’s discarded clothes. I begin to read: ‘‘Let us go then, you and I,/When the evening is spread out against the sky/Like a patient etherized upon a table’’ — and, with a 17-year-old’s sense of imminent upheaval, feel the stirrings of a new language in me, connected to my own language but having passed through fire. I can’t say whether the voice the poem puts in my head as it extends its opening invitation is stiffly formal, smarmy or seductive. ‘‘Spread yourself out on the floor,’’ it seems to whisper, ‘‘and prepare to be turned inside-out.’’"

He had never noticed it and decided to see where it led; after a short drive, he found himself amid a strange encampment. Withers stepped out of his truck and looked around. Cheerful, rickety houses sprouted from the ground like unclassified fungi, or something dreamed up by Lewis Carroll, but what appealed to him most was the barn; on the side, in large yellow letters, someone had written ‘‘Welcome Home.’’ Withers walked up to a shack that appeared to be inhabited and — overtaken by curiosity — he knocked. The woman who came out looked surprised. She told him that he was on a commune for gay, lesbian and transgender people and suggested politely that he leave. Later, Withers called his friend Neal Appelbaum, the openly gay director of the arts center in neighboring Cannon County, and told him about what he saw. Appelbaum explained that Withers had stumbled into Ida, a commune for queer vegetarians; the entire region was home to maybe a dozen rural planned communities for L.G.B.T.Q. people, a kind of sexually nonconforming Amish country. He also pointed out that the fading sign on the barn didn’t say ‘‘Welcome Home.’’ The last letter was not an ‘‘e’’ but an ‘‘o.’’"

In theory, you can camp elsewhere in Katmai, but the campground has an electric fence and constant activity, making it an unlikely place to find a bear too close to your tent for sleeping comfort."

What’s On TV Friday,2015-08-07,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (Starz Edge) FROZEN (2013) Warm up your vocal cords: This Disney movie musical produced “Let It Go,” the Oscar-winning power anthem written by the married songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee directed this fable about Elsa, above (the voice of Idina Menzel), an ice princess cursed with a frigid touch, and Anna (Kristen Bell), her younger sister and best friend. When Anna falls for a prince (Santino Fontana), Elsa forbids them to marry, casting their Scandinavian kingdom into eternal winter with a wave of her hand. Horrified, she retreats to an ice palace, but sibling love sends Anna plowing through drifts and up glacial ridges in search of Elsa, confident that she can reverse the spell. “Allegorically, ‘Frozen’ lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this blockbuster, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.”"

He’s Got Legs,2015-08-07,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Men and Boys']","Nothing exposes a man to more judgment and ridicule than wearing shorts, whether they’re Boy Scout cargo-style or fashion-designer formal.","Up above the hems of a proper pair of trousers — above the ankle-­baring ends of high-­waters and clam-­diggers, above the shin-­skimming edges of pants named for the isle of Capri and for the gauchos of the Pampas — are the knees.

The man in shorts, meanwhile, occupies a space that is more subtly strange.

"‘Kitchens of the Great Midwest,’ by J.

Ryan Stradal’s appealing first novel — the description is literally as well as metaphorically accurate. Born with a “once-in-a-generation palate,” Eva is a food prodigy. At 3½ months old, she destroys a vegetable stand in pursuit of a perfect heirloom tomato; at 10, she runs a cottage industry from her bedroom closet, growing chocolate habanero peppers so incendiary that her client, the city’s best Mexican restaurant, is forced to post a warning label on the menu; at 11, she earns extra cash from bar bets by consuming quantities of blistering chili and “Circle of Hell” chicken wings. Yet despite a life pockmarked by poverty and other adversities, Eva has an equally outsize heart. A warring mass of desires, talents and imperfections, she’s an attractively flawed, completely likable demigoddess."

Box (whose initials stand for Charles James, dashing your hopes that his full name was Cracker Jack Box) is best known for his series of gritty mysteries about the Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett. But in “Badlands,” a stand-alone suspense thriller new at No. 5 on the hardcover fiction list, Box shifts his attention to North Dakota and the fracking boom; the book, set in the fictional oil town of Grimstad, N.D., is about a 12-year-old boy who witnesses a car accident on his paper route and makes off with the bundle of drugs and money he finds at the scene. As a child, Box had relatives who worked blue-collar jobs in the energy industry — “The house I grew up in didn’t have a single bookcase except mine,” he once told a website devoted to crime fiction — and in this novel he pokes some fun at journalists who reflexively condemn big oil. “They fly all the way here from the East Coast burning up jet fuel,” the town sheriff grouses at one point, “then rent cars and fill ’em with gasoline to drive all the way to Grimstad just so they can trot me out to say, ‘Oil is bad.’ I won’t play their game anymore.” Box has observed reporters up close: He used to be one. “My first job was working for a small Wyoming weekly newspaper,” he told the same website, The Rap Sheet, in 2010. “In retrospect, it was spectacular training in ‘the real world’ for what was to come. I learned so much, and met so many people in all walks of life. Much of what I’ve since written came from those days as a starving reporter.”"

Robin Williams’s Underrated Roles Help Illustrate His Major Talents,2015-08-07,article,News,,['Movies'],"In addition to his well-known roles in films like “Dead Poets Society,” the actor worked on a wide range of less-celebrated films, from “Popeye” to “World’s Greatest Dad.”","This summer brings in close proximity two sad milestones for fans of Robin Williams: July 21 would have been the 64th birthday of this inventive comedian and Academy Award-winning actor, and Aug. 11 is the one-year anniversary of his death. It is a bittersweet occasion to reflect on the range of work that Williams created, as he bounded from classically trained stage actor to stand-up comedian, and from a star of sitcoms to a leading man in movies. While a full consideration of Williams’s career would naturally gravitate toward his sympathetic serio-comic roles in films like “Good Morning Vietnam,” “Dead Poets Society” and “Good Will Hunting,” these performances overshadow other, more idiosyncratic but equally vivid efforts — some from a time when his on-screen persona hadn’t completely coalesced, and others he was able to sneak in once his fame was assured.

Trauma, displacement and fanatical hope have marked all new Americans from the occupants of the Mayflower through every subsequent group who came to these shores (or who were brought here by force). This is the unspoken and sometimes unacknowledged fear and fact of being American: These unkind ghosts of our pasts, these specters of previous selves and previous nations that will not be dismissed so easily, always attend our daily negotiations around identity. They cause a torment that can turn us violent, hateful and self-destructive, and the uneasy grace we win is in itself a remarkable thing. The longer our stay in the United States, the fainter the ghosts get, until they are not much more than a vague unsettled feeling that itself causes even more confusion. Novels by recently arrived Americans have tried to negotiate the struggle to fit into a new home that doesn’t always want them, and the nostalgia for all that has been lost. In this way new immigrant literature mimics its antecedents."

This past Easter, our next-door neighbor invited the kids to swim in their pool afterward. In July, a full three months later, we received an email from our neighbor stating: ‘‘Would you mind reminding your housekeeper that they have a large portion of my swimming towels, I was terribly short this weekend. Hope you had a great Fourth of July.’’ This was the first we heard of missing towels. We did not want our housekeeper to think that we or our neighbor thought the children had taken towels that did not belong to them, so we made the decision to purchase 12 towels and give them to our neighbor. We wrapped them up and left them with a note — ‘‘A little surprise for your generosity.’’ A week later, we found the box of towels with a note back at our door — ‘‘I cannot accept these towels and cannot keep them because it is morally as wrong for me to take your towels as it was for your housekeeper’s children to keep my towels.’’ We do not think the children were morally wrong in intent; they simply did what kids do when getting out of the pool — dry off and then wrap in a towel before piling into cars to go home. Had we known about the towels, we would have collected them at the time, but three months after the fact changes how we think the towels should be regarded. The cost of the towels is not really an issue for us or our neighbors. Should we have tried to retrieve the towels from several families before buying new ones? We are almost certain that our housekeeper was not even aware the children were given towels, as she was at our house the entire swim time cleaning up from the meal. Our effort to replace the towels was meant to defuse the situation, not continue into a towel saga. NAME WITHHELD"

A grand jury in Missouri did not indict the officer, Darren Wilson. Experts said that the use of grand juries in criminal cases already was relatively rare in California.

Because grand jury testimony is often held in secret, Holly Mitchell, the author of the law, said that the change would increase trust in police officers and transparency in government. "

What’s on TV Friday,2015-08-14,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9:15 A.M. (Cinemax) SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET (2007) Johnny Depp, his skin pale and his eyes odd, stars as the vengeful barber (and earned a best actor Oscar nomination) in Tim Burton’s film of the Stephen Sondheim-Hugh Wheeler musical. Helena Bonham Carter is Mrs. Lovett, the pie maker who disposes of Sweeney’s victims. And Alan Rickman is the malevolent judge who had Sweeney transported to Australia, stole his wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and now has guardianship of his teenage daughter. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film “as dark and terrifying as any motion picture in recent memory, not excluding the bloody installments in the ‘Saw’ franchise,” adding, “It is also something close to a masterpiece, a work of extreme — I am tempted to say evil — genius.” In “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” (2005), Mr. Burton’s sugar-rush adaptation of the Roald Dahl book, at 8 p.m. on ABC Family, Mr. Depp portrays an oddly sinister candy maker, and Freddie Highmore is a boy who wants nothing more than to swim in chocolate. Well, who wouldn’t? Despite burdening Willy Wonka with a psychological back story, “there is simply too much pleasure to be found in Wonka’s world to get too hung up about his relationship with his dad,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. “The real lesson of ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ is — or should be — that pleasure and curiosity are their own rewards.”"

At first, place the toothbrush at a safe distance, somewhere out of reach but visible. Every day, inch it closer until you can hold the brush in your hand while you teach the gorilla to open its mouth. To do this, reward it with grapes, slices of apple, popcorn or juice (Crystal Light is an ape favorite). The first time an animal completes the desired behavior, ‘‘jackpot’’ it, offering 10 grapes instead of one. ‘‘Then they’re like, ‘Oh, whatever I just did I should do it again,’ ’’ Carrigan says."

Take Gomez’s large-scale version of Hockney’s iconic ‘‘American Collectors’’ double portrait, for example, which Gomez’s Los Angeles dealer, Charlie James, exhibited at the most recent Expo Chicago. It looks almost exactly like the original portrait of the couple in question, clenched in a grim rictus amid the sculptures in their backyard garden, except that Gomez replaced the two collector protagonists with a pair of dark-skinned gardeners of the sort who regularly do the actual tending of such gardens. Into another Hockney, of one of those nondescript West Los Angeles apartment buildings with its wide front lawn, Gomez slotted a groundskeeper, rake extended. That was the genius of the whole series: how in much the same way that, back in the ’60s, the English transplant Hockney first opened our eyes to so much that we had previously overlooked in Los Angeles, rendering all sorts of things visible to us as if for the first time (those boxy apartment buildings, the distinctive street signs, the moderne furniture, that light), so Gomez seemed to be allowing us, indeed forcing us, to notice the very groundskeepers and housemaids and pool cleaners who make that look, the look of Los Angeles, possible, rendering visible a whole world of people, our fellow humans, who often go unseen (and who, for that matter, because they are sometimes ‘‘illegal,’’ often strive not to be seen)."

The move could leave the United States exposed and undermine efforts to pull the world economy out of the doldrums."

"‘The Pope’s Daughter,’ by Dario Fo",2015-08-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In his first novel, the playwright Dario Fo depicts a Lucrezia Borgia who belies the rumors.","Last year, at the venerable age of 88, the Italian comic Dario Fo took on a new creative challenge. The veteran of more than 60 years as an actor, painter, director, stage designer and playwright (as well as the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature), he had in recent years begun to deliver delightful public lectures on artists — Giotto, Leonardo, Raphael, Caravaggio, Picasso — and architecture, including the Romanesque cathedral of Modena. But up to 2014, he had never written a novel. That changed with “The Pope’s Daughter,” now translated into English, although needless to say for this wild man of the theater, the word “novel” is not quite enough to encompass his lightly fictional labor of love for, of all people, Lucrezia Borgia. “The Pope’s Daughter” is also a picture book, illustrated with some of Fo’s own colorful paintings, most based on Renaissance originals. It has since become a full-blown theatrical script. (Meanwhile, Fo has finished a second illustrated novel, inspired by an 18th-century Danish prince, Christian VII.)"

The writing table’s curious height enabled Virginia to peer at the world from the same viewpoint as her artist sister, to witness all at once the world itself, the world transcribed in ink and the world brushed onto a canvas. Later, when Woolf created the character of the painter Lily Briscoe in “To the Lighthouse,” she knew the mix of delicacy and passion that collide to create a great work, and she was schooled in the fine craft of transforming daubs of paint into strings of words."

"‘Brief Loves That Live Forever’ and ‘A Woman Loved,’ by Andrei Makine",2015-08-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Two novels set in Soviet Russia exalt everyday joys and imagine Catherine the Great’s yearnings.,"As a child growing up in a Soviet orphanage, the narrator of Andrei Makine’s memoiristic novel “Brief Loves That Live Forever” recalls being completely in thrall to the idea of a “dazzlingly white city” where everything would be abundant and free, and people would help themselves only to as much as they needed. The harsh realities of daily life under Communism being what they are, disillusionment sets in quickly. Even so, the novel’s dreamy and impressionistic linked episodes, which take the narrator from his boyhood under Brezhnev to his adulthood, offer up this essential truth: Fleeting moments of beauty and love are to be treasured above all else. Carved out of even the most dreary and oppressive circumstances, they’re the sum of a life, a means of triumphing over brutality, a more powerful form of resistance than “dissident whisperings.”"
Jeff Bartsch’s ‘Two Across’,2015-08-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A crossword creator and con man eludes the woman who loves him, until he realizes his error.","Right before college-age Vera Baxter disappears from Stanley Owens’s life for the second time, she wakes up in the middle of the night, wondering whether she should leave him. “Maybe,” she thinks, “it was better to make important decisions in the misty neverland of a tired mind, when she might be closer to her real desires, than using all the well-rested but suspect might of logic.” It’s one of many moments in Jeff Bartsch’s new novel, “Two Across,” where we’re reminded that brainpower can be vastly overrated, especially in matters of the heart."

"‘Sophie and the Sibyl,’ by Patricia Duncker",2015-08-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A novelist imagines an incident that inspired George Eliot’s “Daniel Deronda.”,"In 1863, George Eliot received the largest advance that had yet been offered for a novel; the £7,000 paid for “Romola” were well-earned. Her previous books had captured a zeitgeist. They received rave reviews, sold enviably well and were even quoted in debates in Parliament. Her stories were much talked about, but Eliot’s authorship and life were also subjects of gossip and speculation; writing under a pen name, the journalist and translator Marian Evans was also scandalously cohabiting with a married man. Evans was a social pariah, but Eliot was now a success."
"‘The Dressmaker,’ by Rosalie Ham",2015-08-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A native daughter’s return to a town of oddballs leads to fashion makeovers, and revenge.","Rosalie Ham’s novel “The Dressmaker” was published in Australia in 2000 and later this year will be presented as a movie starring Kate Winslet. What’s surprising is that a film version took so long to appear. From the moment the book opens, with a long shot of “wheat-yellow plains” around the “dark blot” of a hill in the small country town of Dungatar, we sense that we’re on our way to quirky-indie-movie land; and once the camera closes in on the “tumbling brown house” of Mad ­Molly, “leaning provocatively on the grassy curve,” it’s clear we’re visiting a small 1950s town not of history but as imagined by Tim Burton: the gothic, polarized world of “Edward Scissorhands.”"
Inside the List,2015-08-14,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"“Voices in the Ocean,” Susan Casey’s look at dolphin intelligence, is new at No. 13 on the hardcover nonfiction list.","The Dolphin Whisperer: One of the more entertaining figures in “Voices in the Ocean,” Susan Casey’s look at dolphin intelligence — new at No. 13 on the hardcover nonfiction list — is the neurophysiologist John C. Lilly, who before his death in 2001 did as much as anyone to promote the image of dolphins as a nearly alien superspecies that might speak English someday. In the 1960s, Lilly’s unfettered enthusiasm caught on big with a certain segment of the public, but his fellow scientists were less enthralled: As Casey notes, the trade reviews of his 1961 book, “Man and Dolphin,” were scathing. “Scientifically unsound and naïve,” Natural History fumed, judging the book a perfect example of “how not to do scientific research.” The biologist E.O. Wilson called it “borderline irresponsible,” and a Navy researcher snarked: “I find Dr. Lilly’s work very interesting. I like Dr. Seuss, too.” Not that the reviews hurt the book’s prospects: “Man and Dolphin” hit the New York Times best-seller list at No. 15.

The shootings were carried out by gunmen wearing balaclavas during a span of about three hours on Thursday night in the metropolitan area of São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, according to video images captured on security cameras and witness accounts. “When we get to the suspects, whether they are police or not, we’ll act quickly to detain them,” Alexandre de Moraes, the top security official in São Paulo State, told reporters. He said investigators were examining whether the killings were reprisals for the recent shooting deaths of two police officers. The killings added to concern among human rights groups over a spate of similar episodes in Brazil that have left dozens dead in other cities, including Manaus and Belém. Police officers killed at least 2,212 people in Brazil in 2013, though the actual number of such killings around the country is thought to be much higher because some states do not report them. "

What’s on TV Saturday,2015-08-15,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (2014) Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his portrayal of the British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who, as a graduate student at Cambridge intent on fathoming the origins of the universe and locating the beginning of time, learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Felicity Jones, who earned a nomination, plays his first wife, Jane Hawking, whose memoir, “Traveling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen,” is the main source for James Marsh’s portrait of a marriage. “Mr. Redmayne, hunched into a wheelchair, the muscles of his face spread into what looks like a permanent smile, must communicate his character’s feelings almost entirely with his eyes, which are remarkably expressive, conveying Stephen’s mischievous wit as well as his intelligence,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this best picture nominee. “But it is in showing the application of that intelligence that ‘The Theory of Everything’ tumbles into a black hole of biopic banality.” The film’s historical and scientific lapses have been enumerated, but “taking liberties with facts is a prerogative of storytelling,” he said. The greater failing is that Mr. Marsh seems “unable to capture the spirit and energy of scientific inquiry.”"

Mario Vargas Llosa’s ‘Notes on the Death of Culture’,2015-08-17,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A Nobel laureate weighs in on the diffusion of culture and the loss of common referents. ,"I call it the newspaper problem: About a decade ago I wrote an essay on contemporary poetry for a newspaper that will remain nameless, and had the occasion to quote a line by “Eliot.” The editor sent back many changes, the most telling of which was that the quotation was now attributed to “the English poet T.S. Eliot.” Vaguely piqued, I asked what the editor was trying to clarify: Was he afraid readers wouldn’t realize the quotation came from a poem? Or was he afraid readers might confuse the Eliot who wrote it with, say, George Eliot, the pseudonymous author of “Middlemarch”? Anyway, I noted that the English qualifier was misleading: Though T.S. Eliot had taken British citizenship, he had been born in America. The editor, then, sent on another suggestion: “the American-born English poet T.S. Eliot.” I, having lost all the patience I had as a 24-year-old, replied by modifying that tag to: “the American-born, British-­citizen English-language poet, essayist, dramatist, teacher, publisher and bank teller Thomas Stearns Eliot (1888-1965),” after which the editor finally got the point and canceled the assignment."

One can add to it sunspots, evolution, platinum, chloroform . . . and now autism, as the science journalist Steve Silberman informs us, identified separately by Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger. The crucial difference is that Kanner had the fortune to publish his work in Baltimore, while Asperger had the misfortune to publish his in Nazi-controlled Vienna, and this accident of geopolitics lies at the tragic core of Silberman’s ambitious, meticulous and largehearted (if occasionally long-winded) history, “NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of ­Neurodiversity.” "

A statement by the group, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in The Hague, came a few days after United States officials said Islamic State militants appeared to have used such munitions, possibly mustard gas, on Kurdish fighters in Iraq. If confirmed, it would be the first known use of the weapons by the Islamic State, which occupies parts of Syria and Iraq. The monitoring group called such reports “a matter of serious concern,” and its director, Ahmet Uzumcu, said it would “examine any substantive reports it receives including pertinent information that might be shared” by other signers of the chemical weapons ban, which appeared to be a reference to both Iraq and Syria. Iraq, where hundreds of old, corroded mustard artillery shells remained after the 2003 American invasion, signed the chemical weapons ban in 2009. Syria joined in 2013 after having promised to destroy its chemical stockpile, although the monitoring organization said this year that chlorine bombs had been used in the Syrian conflict. On Aug. 7, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution authorizing an inquiry into who was responsible for the chlorine attacks. "

Rebecca Stead’s ‘Goodbye Stranger’,2015-08-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A seventh grader who survived a near-fatal accident faces evolving friendships and new pitfalls in Rebecca Stead’s novel.,"It’s really no wonder 12-year-olds appear frequently not only in novels written for children but also in those written for adults. Taken together, the characters of some classic literature might give the appearance of a middle-school class trip — with the likes of Carson McCullers, William Golding and Vladimir Nabokov in charge, making use of the power of being 12, which is essentially the power of the threshold. If you write a book about characters of this age, you get to document that fleeting moment of change from childhood to not-childhood, when the only person looking out for you might well be you. McCullers’s brilliant 1946 novel “The Member of the Wedding” used a spiky, soulful 12-year-old girl, Frankie Addams, as a vessel for ideas about, among other things, aloneness — both the day-to-day kind and the mortality kind. Frankie’s yearning to be part of something bigger consumes her. As she describes her brother and his bride, “They are the we of me.”"

So, over the past decade, there has been a vigorous effort to fortify and rebuild our schools, and in this there is a recognition that we have failed our children, especially those living in poverty, those for whom education could — and should — be transformational. From Chicago to New Orleans, school reform has been engineered by the well heeled and well connected — from hedge fund managers to corporate heads to directors of foundations — who believe that with the right kind of teachers and pedagogy, and with a ­business-like administration, schooling can trump the daily burdens and indignities of growing up poor. “No excuses” has become the rallying cry of the reformers."

The person with whom she was speaking, a department manager, responded that it was a great book and that it must be legitimate because it was endorsed by Henry Ford. I’m uncomfortable that this type of conversation might reflect a negative aspect of our tenant’s company culture. I’m tempted to raise this with the general counsel of the company, with whom I negotiated the lease — but for what purpose? I can’t betray the confidence, so what am I trying to accomplish? I can’t get over that employees working in a respected chain could really accept any premise in that anti-Semitic rant. I thought the reach of the book was limited to uneducated neo-Nazis, but these are educated people in positions of authority. Something just feels wrong here, and I would appreciate some guidance on where to go with this. NAME WITHHELD"

Turner the man lived with his father (Paul Jesson), copulated with his longtime housekeeper (Dorothy Atkinson) and ignored his daughters by his semi-estranged wife (Ruth Sheen) while keeping company with a kindhearted widow (Marion Bailey) whose last name he adopts. “ ‘Mr. Turner’ is a mighty work of critical imagination, a loving, unsentimental portrait of a rare creative soul,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this Oscar nominee in cinematography, costume and production design, and original score. “But even as it celebrates a glorious painter and illuminates the sources of his pictures with startling clarity and insight, the movie patiently and thoroughly demolishes more than a century’s worth of mythology about what art is and how artists work.” He added, “It might be risking Ruskinesque folly to take ‘Mr. Turner’ as a self-portrait of its director, but Turner shares with Mr. Leigh an ability to travel the circuit between the sublime and the ordinary, to bring into view aspects of reality that had been somehow invisible in plain sight.”"

Her magazine, Ms., which she co-founded in 1971, was notable for being owned and operated entirely by women, and was one of the first mainstream publications to directly address the issues of reproductive rights and domestic violence. And while many of her detractors (Richard Nixon, Rush Limbaugh) have fallen by the wayside, Steinem remains relevant. Her forthcoming memoir, ‘‘My Life on the Road,’’ documents her travels as an activist, and, at 81, she is an icon for a new wave of celebrity feminists that includes Lena Dunham and Emma Watson. Here, a front-line look at Steinem’s legacy."

So it’s all the more shocking that honest-to-goodness actors like Zachary Quinto and Rupert Friend have signed on to play the film’s two leads; maybe the director, Aleksander Bach, told them they could have a lifetime supply of their smoking-hot suits."

"
Review: ‘The Iron Ministry’ Uses Train Passengers to Tell China’s Story,2015-08-20,article,Review,,"['Movies', 'Documentary Films and Programs']",J. P. Sniadecki spent nearly three years filming this documentary on the trains that carry tens of millions across the nation each year.,"If a pop culture web publication ever asked me to make a list of the most cinematic forms of transportation, the train would be at the top, probably followed by the horse. Car chases are cool and everything, but the very first publicly shown movie (at least according to legend) was about a train. Trains on film are both sublime and intimate: The camera can trace the muscular movement of railway cars across the land or venture inside to observe the complicated actions of people in motion. "
Vintage Sax Solo Improves With (Listener’s) Age,2015-08-20,article,News,,"['Music', 'Jazz']",A 1946 Dial jazz recording session with Lucky Thompson on tenor saxophone strikes a mature ear differently than it did a young one.,"Charlie Parker, the matchless alto saxophonist and bebop exemplar, had few better days in a recording studio than March 28, 1946. He was in Hollywood, leading his first session under an exclusive contract with Dial Records. His handpicked sidemen included the well-seasoned tenor saxophonist Lucky Thompson and a young trumpeter named Miles Davis, and by the end of the date they had recorded several of Parker’s most canonical tracks, including “A Night in Tunisia” and “Yardbird Suite.”"
A Shakespeare for All Seasons,2015-08-20,article,News,,['Theater'],"As you grow older, Shakespeare’s characters and language tend to assert themselves in your consciousness in changing ways.","For many theatergoers, summer is the season of Shakespeare, in the way it’s the season of corn and tomatoes for those who want these foods fresh from the garden. Like such comestibles, Shakespeare can be devoured in hearty single sittings — and often alfresco — what with a crop of productions that present the theatrical equivalent of a jolly picnic. For New Yorkers, an abundance of movable feasts is available, from city parks and parking lots to more sylvan environs upstate. (On my August schedule: yet another “Hamlet,” this one starring Benedict Cumberbatch, in London.)"
Frederick Wiseman’s Documentaries Defy Straightforward Plot,2015-08-20,article,News,,"['Movies', 'Documentary Films and Programs']","His films, like “Titicut Follies” and “At Berkeley,” examine places, institutions and social phenomena by slowly revealing the subtle layers and patterns in their topics.","The closer it hews to the conventions of journalism, the more documentary filmmaking becomes an art of compression and acceleration. You know the drill. A social problem is explored, a famous or obscure person’s life story is told, a historical episode is illuminated, in a familiar rhythm and pace. Talking-head interviews alternate with archival clips or re-enactments, all in the service of an argument or a plot. Usually it’s all over in about 90 minutes, and you take away a neat little package of outrage, empathy or enlightenment. Even long-form documentaries, like “The Jinx,” Andrew Jarecki’s mini-series on the alleged crimes of Robert Durst, follow this formula, in that they depend on the quickening of the viewer’s attention. "
Holding Off Emily Dickinson’s ‘Complete Poems’,2015-08-20,article,News,,['Poetry and Poets'],The poet’s famous line — “I’m nobody! Who are you?” — is not what you want to hear when you are younger than 30.,"I’m embarrassed by how long I resisted Emily Dickinson’s “Complete Poems,” and I’m struck by how much my copy means to me now. As a daft young punk I too often sought out reckless emotion and vulgar effects, the same way one sometimes wants, when callow and feckless, to date a person with obvious physical attributes. Dickinson’s famous line — “I’m nobody! Who are you?” — is not what you want to hear when you are younger than 30, or, in my delayed maturity, closer to 40. It should have helped, but did not, when one of my favorite high school English teachers, Donald Glancy, explained that you could sing nearly all of Dickinson’s verse to the tune of “The Yellow Rose of Texas.”"

Turn it on, and it just keeps teaching."
Awakening to the Joys of ‘The Sleeping Beauty’,2015-08-20,article,News,,['Dancing'],A dance critic learns to embrace the classicism and humanity of a ballet that at first seemed all surface.,"At the age of 35, I tried counting. I found I’d seen the ballet “The Sleeping Beauty” 200 times. That was 1990, precisely a century after the composer Tchaikovsky and the choreographer Marius Petipa had first presented it in St. Petersburg. Since then, I’ve watched it on many more occasions — 10 so far in 2015 alone. "
Another Definition for Extended Play,2015-08-20,article,News,,['Theater'],Giving up hours of a day to an immersive theater experience can be a particularly pleasurable escape from the world.,"I like a short show. A 90-minute play means more time to write, more time to relax, a chance to see my husband before he goes to sleep, no tedious intermission. But I also have a sneaking fondness for longer plays. Much, much, much longer ones."
Mondrian’s Paintings and Their Pulsating Intricacy,2015-08-20,article,News,,['Art'],Five works at MoMA summarize the artist’s quest to activate the surface of the canvas and open the viewer’s eyes.,"The longer I look at Mondrian’s paintings, the more I see in them. This applies to lots of art, but I think Mondrian built real time into his paintings. They unfold with unusual deliberation in a semblance of symmetry and order that is actually precarious, even volatile. This is especially true of his mature works from the late 1920s to the early 1940s, with their tensile fusions of glowing white backgrounds, black scaffoldings and blocks of bright primaries. Everything about them, the tiniest decision, is evident and has visual repercussions."
"Revisiting ‘The X-Files,’ a Series Worth Another Watch",2015-08-20,article,News,,['Television'],"Endlessly imitated and never equaled, this show was ahead of its time in its subject matter, format and ability to balance mythology and procedural episodes.","Television is not an art of slow contemplation. Watching it in real time is more or less a requirement. (My DVR offers slow-motion playback, which has its uses, but they’re not artistic.)"
‘It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’ Converts a Skeptic,2015-08-20,article,News,,['Television'],"A critic says he has come to appreciate this sitcom, even how it invents new ways for its core characters to behave badly.","For years I was put off by the unrelenting crudeness of the television comedy “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” In 2011 I wrote a minute-by-minute comparison of its Season 7 premiere with the Season 3 premiere of another crass show, “Blue Mountain State,” assessing which was more vulgar. It was a tongue-in-cheek article, but the tsk-tsking undertone was undeniable."
"For Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony, a Long Delayed Appreciation",2015-08-20,article,News,,"['Music', 'Classical Music']","It was deeper immersion in Wagner and Schubert that opened a music critic to Bruckner, the master Austrian symphonist.","By the time I was a music major in college, with all the composers of the past competing for my attention, I had decided I could take a pass on Anton Bruckner. Many great artists, including the conductor Bruno Walter, whom I idolized, championed Bruckner (1824-1896) as a master Austrian symphonist. But from my impatient samplings of those symphonies, Bruckner struck me as a kind of ponderously monumental Brahms, or an inert and stretched-out Mahler."

Review: ‘Learning to Drive’ Charts a Culture-Bridging Friendship,2015-08-20,article,Review,,['Movies'],"This grown-up drama stars Patricia Clarkson as a New York book critic, and Ben Kingsley as her Indian-American driving instructor.","Among the charms of “Learning to Drive,” a small, observant dual portrait of a New York book critic and her Indian-American driving instructor, are the detailed, lived-in performances of its stars, Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley. The film belongs to a school of grown-up, low-drama two-handers, of which the most famous example is “Driving Miss Daisy,” but “Learning to Drive” isn’t half as sentimental. As this movie, directed by Isabel Coixet, tracks the deepening friendship between people from different cultures and backgrounds, it acquires an unforced metaphorical resonance. "
Kazakhstan’s Currency Plunges,2015-08-20,article,News,,"['Currency', 'Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline']","Financial analysts say the currencies of Kazakhstan’s neighbors in Central Asia will likely fall, as well.","MOSCOW — Kazakhstan’s currency, the tenge, plunged by about a quarter on Thursday after the central bank stopped managing the exchange rate, prompting fears that a wider emerging market currency rout could be coming."
Review: Hapless Brothers and Their Lovers Intersect in ‘The Mend’,2015-08-20,article,Review,,['Movies'],Two brothers contend with girlfriends past and present in John Magary’s character-driven study of masculinity.,"Funny, rugged and raw, “The Mend” fits its story together from rough patches in the lives of two nose-diving New York brothers. Mat (Josh Lucas) is a freeloader (and sometime jerk) who is thrown out of the house by his girlfriend, Andrea (Lucy Owen). The slow-burning Alan (Stephen Plunkett) is treading water with his girlfriend, Farrah (Mickey Sumner), and hopes to take a big step when they are on a planned trip together. Directing his first feature after some shorts, John Magary digs into his characters with fresh eyes and a sly sense of adventure."

Review: ‘She’s Funny That Way’ Offers Tomfoolery Amid the Floodlights,2015-08-20,article,Review,,['Movies'],Peter Bogdanovich’s first feature in more than a dozen years is a screwball comedy centered on a Broadway director and his circle.,"If only the title of “She’s Funny That Way” were true, then maybe this creaky throwback padded with Hollywood names and fake accents could be forgiven its many failings. But there’s barely a whiz-bang punch line or smoothly executed setup to be found in a movie that longs to be a sparkling bedroom comedy and winds up a tortured, fizz-free farce."

Review: Axia Taverna in Tenafly Is Home to Old-School Greek Dishes,2015-08-20,article,News,,['Restaurants'],"The restaurant, which has been popular since it opened in 2006, offers generous main courses that are ideal for sharing.","The scene at Axia Taverna is so lively that it’s easy to forget that the mood in Greece — the country that inspired the restaurant’s cuisine and relaxed, joyous atmosphere — is probably more strained because of the current economic crisis. Everyone at Axia, including staff members, many of whom are from the Mediterranean country, seems to be in celebration mode. The crowds of regulars coming through the oversize wooden front door and the lively traditional music add to the energy."

In a commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials cited concerns over cardiovascular risks of testosterone treatment and suggested that the benefits claimed in ads are unsupported by substantial evidence. The supplements are approved by the F.D.A. for treating classic hypogonadism, which includes well-recognized medical conditions like testicular damage. But most men prescribed testosterone do not appear to have this condition, agency officials wrote, calling the trend troubling. To date, no randomized, controlled trials have been designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes in men taking supplemental testosterone. "

What’s On TV Friday,2015-08-21,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (13) NATIONAL GALLERY (2014) In his 39th documentary, Frederick Wiseman tours the National Gallery in London (above). Docents decode the work of Leonardo, Rembrandt and Turner; restorers use magnifying glasses, eyedroppers, scalpels and cotton swabs to repair a tiny chip in a painting; senior executives politely battle younger ones, who believe the museum is too stodgy; and connoisseurs discuss the underpinnings of masterpieces by Vermeer, Caravaggio, Titian, Velázquez, Pissarro and Rubens. Mr. Wiseman also makes the point that art is the story of human relationships — in labor, commerce, patronage and even the exploitation of bodies. “Mr. Wiseman’s touch is deft but light here, and the experience of watching ‘National Gallery’ is pleasurable and immersive because he’s a wonderful storyteller,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this three-hour movie. “It is also unexpectedly moving. Because his other great theme is how art speaks to us, one he brilliantly expresses in the relay of gazes that finds us looking at museumgoers looking at portraits that look right back — at artists, art lovers and moviegoers — even as Mr. Wiseman, that sly old master, looks at all of us in turn.”"

I learned this from reading Kevyn Aucoin’s ‘‘Making Faces,’’ a glossy volume published in 1997 that quickly became a kind of sacred text among teenage girls. We all trekked to the Borders at Winrock mall in Albuquerque to buy a copy, using the savings we had built up by babysitting or halfheartedly frothing lattes for minimum wage. We lugged the book home (all 160 oversize pages of it) to commune in private with its thick, creamy paperstock full of wisdom about lip shapes, brow bleaching and false eyelashes. We propped it against the bathroom sink as we mashed our fingers into our cheekbones, feeling for deep bone structure. We pored over close-ups of celebrity pores, eager to claim affinity with the actress or supermodel whose skin most matched our own. The girls who learned from Aucoin that they had heart-­shaped faces let everyone at school know about it in the nasal braggadocio common to a certain breed of adolescent queen bee. They were special; the rest of us could only dream of possessing jawlines that ended in a point like valentines."

"‘Mama’s Nightingale,’ by Edwidge Danticat, and More",2015-08-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Four picture books show how immigrant children settle into a changed environment.,"Picture books have long been concerned with helping children transition to an unfamiliar place. A child’s first day in a new school or a family’s move to a different neighborhood are by now classic subjects. But since the dawn of the 21st century, with the number of immigrants in the United States continuing to increase markedly, children’s authors and publishers have begun to take on a far more challenging task — helping immigrant children settle into a new cultural environment, one that even their parents may find inexplicable. Since the principal obstacle to understanding a culture is, of course, the language that expresses it, language can loom large in these books; and a language divide is a concept difficult to express pictorially. Given all this, a child’s experience of immigration is a subject matter that requires some inventive tactics, as four new books ably demonstrate."

They are cute, recognizable and fun to imitate. They play a part in every child’s life, sometimes a big one. But what about the toys and tools children use every day? These make more occasional literary appearances — in, for instance, classics such as “Corduroy,” about a stuffed bear alone in a department store, or even “The Little Engine That Could,” with its dolls and small clown — but they really deserve to be more frequent stars.

1890: Panic on Wall Street,2015-08-21,article,News,,['Stocks and Bonds'],From the International Herald Tribune archives: Wall Street stocks tumble out of sight in 1890.,"This has been the most exciting day Wall Street has seen since the assassination of President Garfield. The stringency in the money market reached such a degree that it precipitated a panic among borrowers and carried the rate of call loans to nearly 190 per cent, the highest rate on record since the chaos resulting from the tragedy of ’81. The demand for funds at this anomalous rate of per cent per day, in addition to the regular rate of interest, cannot honestly be attributed to mere bear manipulation. The eagerness with which long stock was thrown on the market fully attested to the general need for money that prevails in Wall Street. While Wall Street was howling, stocks were tumbling out of sight. The threatened state of affairs on the Vanderbilt railroad system did not improve matters. Heavy liquidation in the entire group was one of the first conspicuous features of the session. — The New York Herald, European Edition, August 22, 1890"

What’s On TV Monday,2015-08-24,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Cinemax) MAPS TO THE STARS (2015) Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore, above), an actress on the verge of unraveling at any moment, has seen the apparition of her mother — a more famous actress, who died in a fire when she was young — and seeks therapy from a self-help guru (John Cusack). He happens to be the father of Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird), an obnoxious young star, and his older sister, Agatha (Mia Wasikowska), who was banished from the family after setting a fire that may have been intended to kill her brother, and which badly burned her. Eventually Agatha befriends a limo driver (Robert Pattinson) and turns an Internet acquaintanceship with Carrie Fisher into a job as Havana’s personal assistant. “Suavely directed by David Cronenberg from an elegantly waspish script by Bruce Wagner, it belongs to the venerable tradition of movieland self-loathing,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It takes a perverse effort of will to love ‘Maps to the Stars.’ It’s a little too chilly, and in some places too easy. But you may find yourself drawn back to it, and retracing its route from the familiar to the uncanny, from entertainment to revulsion, from dream to nightmare.”"

What’s on TV Tuesday,2015-08-25,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Cinemax) DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013) A fiercely gaunt Matthew McConaughey, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician and rodeo rider who, after learning in 1985 that he is H.I.V.-positive, decides to treat himself by hunting down medication that is not then legal in the United States. He eventually begins a subscription service, selling contraband medicine for a monthly fee. Jared Leto, in another Oscar-winning performance, plays Rayon, a transgender woman who becomes Ron’s business partner. And Jennifer Garner is the doctor who turns into an ally. What is largely missing from this drama, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and inspired by real events, “is the sense that Ron’s efforts are part of a larger movement,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Ron’s bravery and determination are entirely credible, thanks to Mr. McConaughey’s disciplined, high-spirited performance and the filmmakers’ interest in the complexity of the character. But his actions unfold in something of a vacuum.”"

Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6, 1965, he felt, his daughter Luci said, “a great sense of victory on one side and a great sense of fear on the other.” According to Ari Berman, a political correspondent for The Nation, he knew the law would transform American politics and democracy more than any other civil rights bill in the 20th century, but he also feared that it would deliver the South to the Republican Party for years to come. Both predictions proved to be accurate. “The revolution of 1965 spawned an equally committed group of counterrevolutionaries,” Berman writes in “Give Us the Ballot.” “Since the V.R.A.’s passage, they have waged a decades-long campaign to restrict voting rights.” Berman argues that these counterrevolutionaries have “in recent years, controlled a majority on the Supreme Court” and “have set their sights on undoing the accomplishments of the 1960s civil rights movement.”"

For Yo La Tengo’s new record, “Stuff Like That There,” which falls firmly in the former category, the band looks backward to “Fakebook,” an LP that came that out 25 years ago and remains a fan favorite today. Like its predecessor, “Stuff Like That There” is made up predominantly of covers — both of classic acts (Hank Williams, The Cure) and of Yo La Tengo themselves (“Deeper Into Movies,” “The Ballad of Red Buckets”). “We kind of took some of the things from ‘Fakebook’ and said, ‘It’s 25 years later, let’s see what happens if we do it again.’ It’s definitely a companion, in our mind,” Kaplan says."

Some names — Valie Export, Ana Mendieta, Edward Krasinski, Juan Downey, Fernando Botero — will be familiar; others will be much less so. The show will surely reflect the MoMA’s desire for a broad global reach, but perhaps also the aesthetic narrowness of its relentless elevation of Conceptual-oriented work.

Haunting Images That Make New York Landmarks Feel New Again,2015-08-27,article,News,,['Photography'],"Kari Soinio manipulates his photos to create a Manhattan that seems, as he says, “both familiar and utterly foreign.”","When he landed in New York City as a first-time tourist in 1990, the Finnish photographer Kari Soinio — like so many visitors before and after him — was struck by the breathtaking sweep of the Manhattan skyline. When he returned to live downtown for an artist residency in 2006, his gaze was again drawn upward. “I was amazed by the canyon of high-rises,” he says, “and the whole idea of the newcomer looking up.” It was with this view in mind that he embarked on an ongoing series, “City of Ghosts,” which combines street and architectural photography. Soinio captures the beauty of the city’s renowned landmarks — the Washington Square Arch, the Flatiron and Woolworth buildings — and pulls them into the foreground, while unwitting passersby become shadowy, anonymous characters in a duet between pedestrian and monument. Shooting with a 4x5-inch camera with no viewfinder, the defocused scene is “both familiar and utterly foreign,” as Soinio puts it, thanks to his manipulation of the images’ depths of field. “In the happy accident of photography, if you really know your camera, you can do so much,” he says. As “City of Ghosts” has continued, Soinio has shifted his attention to the changing urban landscape and the new glass towers that now reach skyward. In an age during which it’s never been more tempting to keep your eyes glued to a screen while traversing the urban landscape, his photos are a welcome reminder: Look up!"

What’s On TV Sunday,2015-08-30,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"11 A.M.

They must protect the last real human city, Zion, while battling the machines and the evil Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). “With enough visual bravado to sustain a steady element of surprise (even when the film’s most important Oracle turns out to be a grandmotherly type who bakes cookies and has magnets on her refrigerator), ‘The Matrix’ makes particular virtues out of eerily inhuman lighting effects, lightning-fast virtual scene changes (as when Neo wishes for guns and thousands of them suddenly appear) and the martial arts stunts that are its single strongest selling point,” Janet Maslin wrote in The Times. “As supervised by Yuen Wo Ping, these airborne sequences bring Hong Kong action style home to audiences in a mainstream American adventure with big prospects as a cult classic and with the future very much in mind.”"

What’s on TV Monday,2015-08-31,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"1:35 P.M. (MAX) THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014) In this Wes Anderson film, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) tells an author (Jude Law) the story of how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel. The film flashes back to 1932, detailing the friendship between the young Zero (Tony Revolori, center, with Tom Wilkinson, left, and and Owen Wilson) and the hotel concierge, Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave is framed for the murder of an aristocrat (Tilda Swinton) and flees with Zero. They are pursued by her family and henchmen (Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe) while trying to protect a prized painting. Zero, meanwhile, deals with romance. “There is no doubt that Mr. Anderson possesses a distinctive sensibility and a consistent visual style, and that instead of striking out in new directions, he tends to embroider and elaborate on familiar themes and pictorial habits,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. “You will see many of them here: static, densely packed, fussily composed frames; traveling shots in which the camera glides alongside the characters like a low-flying bird; action sequences that refuse the usual digital hocus-pocus in favor of the older, artisanal magic of stop-motion animation, matte paintings and rear projection.
