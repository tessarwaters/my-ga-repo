Freud has lost currency in recent decades, but few in the field of sex research, no matter how they qualify his premise or dismiss him as unscientific, would argue that our early experiences don’t have the power to profoundly shape our later cravings, and two experiments described in Jesse Bering’s “Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us” lend indirect proof."

Cain set forth a concept he called the “love rack.” For him, it meant finding a way to manipulate readers into caring about his criminal characters and their plight, and surrendering to the story. The term’s connotations of torture were apt. In Cain’s novels, desire is a prison, a death trap. If the author can seduce the audience into investing in that desire, and the fate of the lovers in its thrall, the reader essentially joins them on that rack, with each plot twist proving another pull of the rope, another turn of the screw."

Despite defiant assertions of independence like the classic “Cherry Bomb,” the band remains cruelly underrated, a perception Evelyn McDonnell seeks to rectify in her scrupulously researched “Queens of Noise.” Ambition and self-determination are prevailing themes: for these women, pursuing those aims in the 1970s could be brutal, especially when contending with adolescent hormones."

What came seeping from around those blockages was a mordant and effervescently graceful disquisition on the nature of poetry, poets, failure and the “interesting blind pain of wrongness”: a riff-tastic essay masquerading as a novel, or vice versa. The voice of Paul Chowder — prickly, whimsical, genially pedagogic, opinion-stippled and often lavishly intelligent — supplied the vessel, yet poetry, the novel’s subject and in some sense its main character, provided the sustenance.

What’s on Saturday,2013-10-05,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9:05 P.M. (Showtime) THE MASTER (2012) Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Lancaster Dodd, the leader of the Cause, a therapeutic, religion-tinged cult built around using painful questions to delve into a subject’s past and get at the root of negative emotion and destructive behavior. Joaquin Phoenix (above left, with Mr. Hoffman) plays Freddie Quell, a World War II Navy veteran and alcoholic wreck who seeks solace through Dodd’s method. And Amy Adams is Peggy Dodd, the latest of her husband’s wives and the hidden hand that guides his empire. “ ‘The Master’ is really more Freddie’s story than Dodd’s, and some of the film’s drama resides in the struggle between the two characters — and perhaps the two actors — for supremacy,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which earned its three principals Oscar nominations. “ ‘You’ll be my protégé and my guinea pig,’ Dodd says to Freddie shortly after their first meeting. There turns out to be a lot more to it than that. They are father and son, guru and disciple, passionate friends and bitter competitors locked in a relationship whose sexual undercurrents are as palpable and mysterious as the motion of water under the surface of the ocean.” The film, he added, “is wild and enormous, its scale almost commensurate with Lancaster Dodd’s hubris and its soul nearly as restless as Freddie Quell’s. It is a movie about the lure and folly of greatness that comes as close as anything I’ve seen recently to being a great movie.” "

And locals and visitors alike are rediscovering the surrounding mountains on the slopes that hosted the 1984 Winter Olympic Games."

(13) 56 UP (2013) In 1964, the director Michael Apted interviewed 14 British 7-year-olds for a television documentary, returning to film the same children every seven years as they progressed into adulthood. This latest installment finds the subjects, like Tony, left, settling into middle age. “As in the earlier movies, Mr. Apted again folds in older material from the ages of 7, 14 and so on, to set the scene and jog memories,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “The abrupt juxtapositions of epochs can be jarring, unnerving or touching — sometimes all three — as bright-faced children bloom and sometimes fade within seconds. An analogous project in print or even still photographs wouldn’t be as powerful, because what gives the ‘Up’ series its punch is not so much its longevity or the human spectacle it offers, but that these are moving images of touchingly vibrant lives at certain moments in time and space. The more you watch, the more the movies transform from mirrors into memory machines, ones that inevitably summon reflections of your own life.”"

Was It All Boehner’s Fault?,2013-10-17,article,News,,"['Executives and Management (Theory)', 'Shutdowns (Institutional)', 'United States Politics and Government']",Why the shutdown fiasco was more a failure of followership than leadership.,"As a follow-up to my post on the lessons of the shutdown, and my insistence on the essentially indefensible folly of what we’ve just witnessed from House Republicans, let me say something about the alternative interpretation that’s come up in a number of mini-debates I’ve had on Twitter over the last week or so, with conservative writers like the Weekly Standard’s Jay Cost and Sean Davis of the nascent webzine The Federalist. Against my indictment of the Republican caucus as a whole, they’ve basically argued that the seeming irrationality of G.O.P. strategy across the last few weeks mostly just reflects the mistakes, shading into incompetence, of John Boehner’s negotiating strategy, rather the kind of deeper, essentially methodless dysfunction that I see when I look at the House Republicans. At bottom, these interlocutors think that the House Republicans are a fairly normal majority with a serious leadership problem, and they think I’m a victim of what you might call the pundit’s limited-horizon problem, which fails to work in vitally-useful knowledge — political science research in Cost’s case, business-school theory in Davis’s case — that would pin more of the responsibility on Boehner, and less on his backbenchers. (You can also read a more personalized version of this argument here, from the pseudonymous blogger Thomas Crown, which is based on a slight misreading of a tweet I wrote to Davis — such are the perils of Twitter! — but which works off the entirely correct assumption that my analysis of internal House dynamics lacks the benefit of sustained personal experience with high-stakes negotiations in politics, law or the business world.)"

Yet her bags are especially well suited to the demands of life in New York. The line, recently rebranded as Clare V., is polished enough for a party, but not too precious for the subway — auxiliary pouches and pockets cleverly accommodate gadgets or spare pairs of shoes. “New York is full of working women who want to look chic while being prepared for all sorts of situations,” Vivier said. Those women can now find the entire Clare V. range at the brand’s second boutique and first East Coast outpost, which opens tonight in a former dressmaker’s shop on Elizabeth Street in NoLIta. Walking into the space feels like being transported to California, thanks to its airy, light-flooded interior (by the L.A.-based architect Barbara Bestor, who also designed Vivier’s Silver Lake flagship) and its mostly SoCal-sourced lifestyle goods (jewelry by Annie Costello Brown, hats by Westbrook Maker, scented candles from the Chateau Marmont). Monograms, a Vivier signature, can be embossed on the spot. Also on view, and worth a visit in its own right, is a colorful nine-foot-wide collage wall by the New York florist and artist Simone Shubuck, a close friend of Vivier’s for 20 years."

The Jean-Georges Kitchen From on High,2013-10-18,article,News,,"['Restaurants', 'Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Kitchens']",The silent dance of the dinner rush.,"While designing the kitchen at his namesake restaurant on Columbus Circle, Jean-Georges Vongerichten traded American efficiency for Old World tyranny. The five food stations, staffed by six cooks (two on fish) and one floating chef (a chef de tournant) are arranged perpendicular to the pass, which is where the food is handed off to the food runners (seen at the bottom of the page), all under the scrutiny of another chef, who runs the line. Typically, Vongerichten says, “you cook against the wall, turn around, plate it and it goes out.” At Jean-Georges, the staff members cook various elements at their stations and then walk them up to the pass — where they assemble the dishes with monastic precision. When your shrimp appetizer, being plated lower left by two cooks, comes with crispy baby artichokes, crispy mushrooms, smoked paprika gel, lemon fennel purée, microthyme and parsley, a more collaborative and focused effort is required.

Amateur literary critics, like Dylan Lucia, an Amazon reviewer who gave one star to “Fahrenheit 451” (“Bradbury is a good writer [I’ll give him that], but I HATE his writing style”), may lack a nuanced understanding of the English language; some amateur film critics, like the IMDB reviewer who gave 10 stars to “Wrath of the Titans” (“i never saw a movie this good before in my life”), may have never seen another movie before in their lives. But all of us with a tongue and a functioning digestive tract are authorities on food. After all, we have a commanding range of experience to draw from: we eat, according to one study, an average of 4.9 times a day.

And early Roman manuscripts include references to “brassica,” a word that encompassed wild turnips, cabbages and kalelike plants. By the Middle Ages, kale had spread through Europe and Asia. The Italians developed plants with “dinosaur” scales, while the Scots created varietals with leaves like frilly petticoats. The Russians produced kale that could survive in the snow. But by the time Tim Peters, who was then farming in Oregon, began experimenting with the plant in the 1980s, kale had become “boring.” “You only saw the green kind in the supermarket,” he says, “if you could find it at all.”"

According to an Associated Press-GfK poll conducted in April, 59 percent of the country believes in a conspiracy, while 24 percent accepts the Warren Commission’s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Another 16 percent isn’t sure. (Yes, that adds up to 99 percent. The rest probably blames President Obama.) The best-seller list reflects this split personality. “Killing Kennedy,” by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard, echoes the Warren Report’s lone gunman thesis and has spent 34 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list; it’s currently on the extended list at No. 22. Meanwhile, a new case for conspiracy hits the nonfiction ­list at No. 14: “They Killed Our President,” by the renowned historian and investigative journalist Jesse (the Body) Ventura, who with Dick Russell and David Wayne argues the president was killed by “disgruntled C.I.A. agents, anti-Castro Cubans and members of the Mafia. . . . Members of the U.S. military were also involved.” Like the former professional wrestler he is, Ventura confronts his biggest rival head on. “Since Bill O’Reilly apparently thinks he knows so much about the J.F.K. assassination,” he writes, “I’d like to publicly challenge him. . . .

Taking inspiration from Kierke­gaard (“Life can only be understood backward; but it must be lived forward”), the devious author begins his story with Chapter 36 and methodically works his way back to Chapter 1. Let’s admit that the prose is a bit flat, and the characters lack nuance, the unavoidable consequence of withholding key information about persons and motives until those last (first!) five chapters give it all up. The reader is never lied to in Deaver’s brilliant shell game, merely misdirected, and the best part of this trick is that despite being in on the game, we continue to make false assumptions."

Design, like all forms of art, can be very personal; members of one of England’s most celebrated families, Emma, Issy and Stella Tennant, draw inspiration from nature, namely from the bucolic surroundings in Scotland to create their sculptures and paintings. It can also be very pared down and minimal, like in the home of two fashion designers in Tokyo, or in the distilled, spacious Antwerp residence of the Belgian architect Vincent Van Duysen. On a larger scale, we discover designers and artisans determined to reinvent neighborhoods and cities around the world. In Sydney’s Rosebery neighborhood, three businesses celebrate the best of the city’s agriculture, craftsmanship and furniture design. Meanwhile, in Belgrade, locals are turning their city into a world-class destination, with the emergence of design hotels, art museums and adventurous restaurants. We embrace those who break with convention in art and design; Not Vital, a Swiss artist obsessed with habitats, is the Picasso, the Dali, the Andy Warhol of today, claims Andrew O’Hagan. Howard Slatkin’s Fifth Avenue apartment is filled with custom-made items, from floor to ceiling; each room has a combination of textiles, lighting, objets d’art from different eras and countries.

But is it?,"In 1971 John Rawls published “A Theory of Justice,” the most significant articulation and defense of political liberalism of the 20th century. Rawls proposed that the structure of a just society was the one that a group of rational actors would come up with if they were operating behind a “veil of ignorance” — that is, provided they had no prior knowledge what their gender, age, wealth, talents, ethnicity and education would be in the imagined society. Since no one would know in advance where in society they would end up, rational agents would select a society in which everyone was guaranteed basic rights, including equality of opportunity. Since genuine (rather than “on paper”) equality of opportunity requires substantial access to resources — shelter, medical care, education — Rawls’s rational actors would also make their society a redistributive one, ensuring a decent standard of life for everyone."

Why Not Medicaid For All?,2013-10-22,article,News,,"['Doctors', 'Health Insurance and Managed Care', 'Liberalism (US Politics)', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Welfare (US)']",Getting down to bedrock in the great health care debate.,"My Sunday column on the potential consequences of Obamacare’s botched rollout ended by sketching a scenario in which the program’s Medicaid expansion is deemed a success while its reform of the individual market leads to much-higher-than-expected costs and much-lower-than-expected participation rates. This combination would no doubt be politically helpful to the Republican Party in the short run, but (I argued) it would actually leave liberals with a fairly clear path forward: Keep pressing the Medicaid expansion on states that haven’t taken it (and look for John Kasich-style Republicans to partner with), return to the Joe Lieberman-killed idea of expanding Medicare to 55-and-overs, and basically try to further shrink the percentage of Americans who aren’t eligible for one or both of those single-payer programs. This wouldn’t amount to the full-on push for single payer that some people expect from the left if Obamacare fails or gets repealed, but it would move the U.S. toward the closest thing to single payer that we’re ever likely to get: A system in which both the late middle-aged and the lower middle class gradually get folded into government-run insurance alongside the poor, the disabled, and the aged; the individual market survives as a kind of de facto high risk pool (overpriced but technically accessible); and the employer mandate helps prop up employer-based health insurance for a shrunken but still substantial share of the population."

Optimists take another view: that, buckle in, China is just getting started, and that what we’re now about to see is the payoff from China’s 30 years of investment in infrastructure and education. I’m not a gambler, so I’ll just watch this from the sidelines.

In Store | Waris Ahluwalia Opens an Old-World Market in Venice,2013-10-25,article,News,,['Collectors and Collections'],"The jeweler, actor and man-about-town will stock unique items from artisans in his new boutique, opening in November, which takes inspiration from ancient trade routes.","Think of Waris Ahluwalia, the jeweler, actor and man-about-every-town, as a modern-day Marco Polo, bringing back implements of leisure from foreign ports of call: Morocco, Bali, India, Sweden, Lebanon. Next month, he opens his House of Waris Rare shop inside the library of Venice’s lavish Gritti Palace hotel. “I’m not just interested in well-designed trophies,” he says. “Whatever we stock should serve an actual purpose.” He steers away from comparisons to Paris’s Deyrolle or any upscale curiosity boutique, talking instead about revisiting ancient trade routes. In some ways this project is the culmination of a three-year expedition he began with the Luxury Collection, which owns the hotel and commissioned Ahluwalia as its global explorer. Everything sold at the shop — engraved tumblers hand-blown in Murano, vintage Fortuny fabrics fashioned into stuffed animals — is the type of affectionate object one might imagine, say, Ernest Hemingway gifting his mistress. Ahluwalia has stocked the shop with unique goods from artisans both emerging and established, including his own fine jewelry. “You can’t just ogle and awe,” he says about these collectibles. “You must engage as a patron. It’s not just the items that are unique — so too are the people who make them.”"

The weekend host of the radio program, Ian Punnett, was interviewing me, a Harvard Medical School physician and national expert on the compelling world of zombie neuroscience. Punnett asked me to help make sense of a new and terrifying threat to our planet, and I told him what I had learned from a discovered manuscript penned by a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had succumbed to a zombie plague while studying its origins. The newly uncovered disease was called Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency syndrome (A.N.S.D.), I explained, and the C.D.C. expert worried that the disease had been engineered by nefarious hedge-fund managers, in hopes that the stock market would plunge and become vulnerable to manipulations as the chaos spread."
Who Made That Coffee Lid?,2013-10-25,article,News,,"['Inventions and Patents', 'Coffee']",How a lawsuit sent America’s inventors to work.,"In the late 1970s, when you ordered coffee to go, you usually had to tear a hole in the plastic lid if you wanted to drink through it. This maneuver was so awkward that you risked burning your hand. So in the 1980s, a number of food-packaging engineers tried to fix the problem. William and Kenneth Dart, of the Dart Container Corporation, created one of the first of a new breed of coffee-cup lids, filing a patent in 1981 for a plastic disc with a press-down tab that acted like a valve. The inventors called this feature a “lip-engaging buttress”; you pushed on it with your upper lip to release a gulp of coffee. Once you finished drinking, the tab snapped back into place to prevent spills. (Kenneth Dart, who made a fortune in this and other business ventures, later renounced his citizenship and moved to Belize, where he was exempt from U.S. taxes.)"

The book is full of players and posers, among them a widow who writes to the newspapers in her dead husband’s name and mourners who “performed their sadness flamboyantly, pushing the very limits of realism.” Even the elusive narrator, a magazine writer, is playacting, pursuing a story that is unlikely ever to see print."

There are few leaders in modern Chinese history more layered with prejudice begging to be stripped away than Cixi, the dowager empress who ruled China for almost half a century until her death in 1908. For decades, she was condescendingly referred to in the West as “the Old Buddha,” the “She Dragon,” the usurper of a throne “over whose disintegration she presided.”"

Eliza — totally alone in the world, her sole companions the protagonists of Dickens, her recent dreams filled with “dark graveyards and irregular vistas” — seems primed for a richly horrifying experience. Arriving soaked to the bone and in the dead of night, the new governess of Gaudlin finds not the greeting of a warm fire and a noble family at its ease, but two eerily well-mannered children alone in an otherwise empty house.

The Reawakening,2013-10-25,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Sara Wheeler follows six 19th-century women who left England and reinvented themselves in the United States.,"Just give in — I finally did — to the rough-edged charms of Sara Wheeler’s latest hybrid of historical narrative and travelogue. Never mind that Wheeler, a British author whose previous book, “Terra Incognita,” chronicled her adventures in Antarctica, commits the same sin as at least two of the six women writers she profiles: Fanny Trollope, whose withering account of life along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, “Domestic Manners of the Americans,” infuriated American readers; and Fanny Kemble Butler, whose reflexively judgmental “Journal of a Residence in America” provoked a breach with her American husband. Wheeler seems not to have calculated the effects of her own gratuitous insults, whether aimed at the “agreeable Fatty­towns” of the Midwest or the “crap of contemporary America” she encounters at a once-grand seaside resort community in Massachusetts. Even her praise can be faintly damning: “On the whole Americans are a friendly, polite lot.”"

Everything on the page is the result of a series of strenuous choices, none inevitable, and reminding the reader just who made these choices (whether conscious or not) can be amusing, aesthetically useful and a great relief from the constraints of the traditional conventions of fiction. But intelligent readers may not need reminding, may even take it as an insult. They know who the puppets are and who the puppeteer. They have sought out fiction for a reason: quite often they simply wish the puppeteer would shut up, back away and get on with the storytelling."

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, adding that perhaps the film’s achievement “should be quantified rather than judged in more conventional, qualitative ways. This is by no means the best movie of the year, but it may be the most movie you can get for the price of a single ticket.” Its six sections also star Doona Bae, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving and Ben Whishaw. “Together the filmmakers try so hard to give you everything — the secrets of the universe and the human heart; action, laughs and romance; tragedy and mystery — that you may wind up feeling both grateful and disappointed.” "

The men filmed the proceedings — from pitches to billionaires and studio moguls to encounters with movie stars and directors — then turned it into a cinematic romp about Hollywood deal making. “ ‘Seduced and Abandoned,’ which uses split screens much of the time, rambles entertainingly from topic to topic,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “It begins with a complaint ascribed to Orson Welles that he spent 95 percent of his life running around trying to raise money for movies and 5 percent making them.

So it is probably time to stop the comparisons and accept or reject it on its own terms."
