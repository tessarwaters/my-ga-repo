Sally Rooney and Love in the Time of General Systems Collapse,2021-09-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In “Beautiful World, Where Are You,” the novelist and her stand-ins chew over questions about fame, sex, idealism and other subjects.","It’s very Gen X to complain about stardom, to make a show of resisting it. A bit ironic then, if understandable, that the Irish novelist Sally Rooney is chafing at her fame. If you read only glancingly about literary culture, you could be forgiven for thinking that she is less a writer than a piece of $20 avocado toast, an excuse for people to express bafflement at the very idea of millennials and what they might be after or up to. Generational profiles often have broad truths to offer, but Rooney’s youth (the author of “Conversations With Friends” and “Normal People” is just now 30) seems to have short-circuited many observers. The discussion around her can feel so extraliterary that it’s easy to lose sight of what she does well on the page, which is quite a bit."

I really don’t know how to deal with this situation productively as an ally. I usually don’t mention it to my friend both because I feel it’s my responsibility to deal with it and because we’ll probably never see the offending person again. I don’t even really know if it’s something that would upset her, but I know nobody’s ever waited for me to walk away so that they could ask my friend what kind of white I am.

Even so, the total number of voters amounted to just 48 percent of the population measured in the 2020 census. Most people living in America either could not or did not cast a vote.For each group of people prohibited from casting a vote, there is some rationale. Noncitizens are not formally part of the body politic; democracies since Athens have included franchise restrictions as punishment for criminals; children can’t make well-informed rational choices. Many people may disagree with one or several of these choices. Maybe denying the franchise to felons is unjust, given bias in the criminal justice system, or perhaps permanent residents should be allowed to vote, as they often could in the 19th century."

Pandanus is a genus of tropical evergreens that grow in Southeast and South Asia, Oceania and Africa, with leaves that tend to rise and arch in a whorl around the stem and bulbous fruit, whose polyp-like knobs evoke a pineapple’s armor — hence the English name, screw pine. For Leichhardt, initial results were poor: the “rich, mellow pear-like” flesh of the fruit, he wrote, proved to be “hot, and made our lips and tongues very sore.” (Stomach trouble ensued.) Snooping around the remains of campfires abandoned by locals, he deduced that the fruit had to be buried in hot ash, then soaked and roasted before it could be considered edible."

The heavily reinforced trunks he fashioned had to be big enough to hold months’ worth of belongings and to endure long sea voyages and arduous train trips. But in the years between the world wars, as automobile and commercial air travel proliferated, life on the road became easier and more streamlined, as did the luggage the house produced. During the 1930s, the company began making a trio of boxy poplar-wood-frame suitcases in graduated sizes — the Alzer, the Bisten and the Corté, the last of which has been known since the late 1960s as the Cotteville — covered in the brand’s monogrammed canvas. The smallest of Louis Vuitton’s hard-sided porte-habits (at only 16 inches wide), the Cotteville, which, like the larger cases, is adorned with the signature S lock, leather trim and brass fittings, has always been synonymous with on-the-fly luxury. This season, Virgil Abloh, the artistic director of the brand’s men’s wear line, has designed the Cotteville 40 in the house’s Mirror Monogram canvas with silvery metal trim and a contrasting pale leather handle. Reflective of a collective craving for travel, the compact suitcase seems perfect for its era: shiny and hopeful, with a nod to the past."

The New Science on How We Burn Calories,2021-09-14,article,News,,"['Weight', 'Calories', 'Diet and Nutrition', 'Age, Chronological', 'Research', 'audio-neutral-informative']","How could that change our understanding about, for starters, chronic disease, aging and obesity?","It’s simple, we are often told: All you have to do to maintain a healthy weight is ensure that the number of calories you ingest stays the same as the number of calories you expend. If you take in more calories, or energy, than you use, you gain weight; if the output is greater than the input, you lose it. But while we’re often conscious of burning calories when we’re working out, 55 to 70 percent of what we eat and drink actually goes toward fueling all the invisible chemical reactions that take place in our body to keep us alive. “We think about metabolism as just being about exercise, but it’s so much more than that,” says Herman Pontzer, an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. “It’s literally the running total of how busy your cells are throughout the day.” Figuring out your total energy expenditure tells you how many calories you need to stay alive. But it also tells you “how the body is functioning,” Pontzer says. “There is no more direct measure of that than energy expenditure.”"

A Cartier Tiara for Life’s Grandest Occasions,2021-09-27,article,News,,['Jewels and Jewelry'],This diamond-encrusted diadem is sure to be the crowning glory of any royal fantasy.,"A tiara is never worn casually. Unlike a necklace or bracelet, which can be little more than a simple rope or chain offhandedly draped around the neck or wrist, diadems are, by definition, grand. The early Greeks replaced laurel and olive wreaths with gold versions in increasingly complex styles. During the 18th century, gemstones became the focus and the tiara morphed from a unisex accouterment into a female-identified one. Napoleon, a die-hard neo-classicist, was a particular champion — he lavished tiaras on both wives — as was Queen Victoria, whose example was followed by the ladies of her court. This design, by Cartier, the Paris-based house that has been crafting tiaras since the turn of the 20th century — including the 1936 Halo commissioned by King George VI for his wife, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and later worn by Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, at her wedding in 2011 — continues that tradition. Made of 18-karat white-gold arabesques and adorned with diamonds in cushion, square and brilliant cuts, it brings fantasy, and history’s most regal moments, vividly alive.

Cheese Making at Jasper Hill Farm Gets a French Advantage,2021-09-27,article,News,,['Cheese'],The creamery is starting to turn out even more of its high-quality cheeses thanks to several copper-lined vats from France.,"Mateo Kehler, the cheese maker who owns Jasper Hill Farm in northern Vermont with his brother, Andy, has just eliminated a lot of backbreaking work for the esteemed creamery. He bought a few big copper-lined vats that a Comté cheese maker in the Jura region of eastern France no longer uses because they have transitioned to larger equipment. The secondhand vats, which can handle 3,000 liters (3,170 quarts) of milk, replace Mr. Kehler’s smaller vessels.
