In long shot, a teenage girl walking on a tree-canopied street in Anywhere, U.S.A., is suddenly snatched and hustled into a car. It’s a disquieting overture, partly because it takes place in daylight. Mostly, though, it’s because there are no close-ups of the assault, no cutaways to the presumably terrified victim or views of her two abductors, a man and a woman who materialize as if out of nowhere. This is terror at an artful remove."

(I’d call Melville’s 14,000-plus-word “Bartleby” a novella — he called it a “tale” — and Joyce’s “The Dead,” some 1,500 words longer, a story.) Certainly Jim Harrison isn’t sniffy about the word — in fact, Jim Harrison isn’t sniffy about much — and since his first collection of novellas, the 1979 “Legends of the Fall,” he has done as much as any living writer to demonstrate the validity and vitality of the form."

And the migrant writer hatched a new language along the way. “To conquer English may be to complete the process of making ourselves free,” Rushdie wrote in his 1991 essay collection, “Imaginary Homelands.” Shoals of people still move across the world today, but the idea of a literature of migration seems to have fallen out of fashion — not with readers but with writers, some of whom chafe at being narrowly categorized, consigned to an ethnic beat, their work treated as sociology instead of art."

Inside the List,2016-03-11,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"“Seven Brief Lessons on Physics,” No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list, outsold “Fifty Shades of Grey” in its author Carlo Rovelli’s native Italy.","Let’s Get Physical: If you believe Einstein, time as we usually understand it is “nothing more than a persistent, stubborn illusion.” That may be. But timing is still everything — and the timing could hardly be better for the theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli’s latest book, “Seven Brief Lessons on Physics,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 5. Originally published two years ago in Rovelli’s native Italy (where it outsold “Fifty Shades of Grey”), the book arrives in America less than a month after scientists announced the first direct evidence of gravitational waves, confirming Einstein’s theory of general relativity and reigniting the public’s occasional love affair with what may be the hardest of the hard sciences. (Over the years, other theoretical physicists to hit the list have included Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Lisa Randall and Lawrence Krauss.) Rovelli, as it happens, is an expert on gravity: He’s a founder of the loop quantum gravity theory, the chief competitor to string theory among efforts to unite the macro world of relativity with the micro world of quantum mechanics. So he was giddy at the news that gravitational waves had been detected. “For physicists this is an ecstatic moment,” he wrote on Slate. “If a benign nature wanted to honor the centenary of Einstein’s idea, she has found the most elegant way. It’s hard to imagine a more vivid indication of the power of scientific reason: From indirect evidence and clarity of thought, reason sees so far that it takes another century before our eyes and our hands can follow up.”"
"‘Anna and the Swallow Man,’ by Gavriel Savit",2016-03-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Orphaned by the Nazis, a young girl survives by wandering the countryside with a mysterious, possibly magical stranger.","There are two questions about Gavriel Savit’s splendid debut novel that are sure to be asked repeatedly: Is it an allegory, and at whom is it aimed? The first I believe Savit answers clearly. “The world understands stories,” he has one of his main characters come to realize, “not as absolute, irrevocably factual truths that simply don’t exist, but as flaccid allegories or metaphors.” You may read the novel as allegory; go ahead. All stories are allegory. This one makes use of stock figures from European folklore (the fool, the golem, the trickster, the demon, animal shape-changers). It’s also tempting to expand on ways in which the novel’s characters represent aspects of the Polish people during World War II. Even the winsome chapter-heading designs created by the illustrator Laura Carlin can be interpreted in more than one way. But Anna and the Swallow Man, and the very human people they meet in the course of the novel, also have their own plausible existence within the rules of the world we know. Indeed, they learn to question and distrust allegory as the tale progresses. For every apparent piece of magic performed in the text, there is a scientific explanation. When the Swallow Man gives Anna a fantastical description of the medicine he takes, for example, there is a literal interpretation as well. This is masterly storytelling."
"‘The Girl in the Well Is Me,’ by Karen Rivers",2016-03-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Trapped by a freakish accident, a girl reconsiders her priorities and her family’s travails. ","Anyone of a certain age remembers the little girl who fell into a well in Texas in the late 1980s. Workers spent three days trying to free her. It was the stuff of parent nightmares.

"‘Innocents and Others,’ by Dana Spiotta",2016-03-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Dana Spiotta’s novel, two women who grew up together remain in each other’s lives and art.","The literature of friendship, like friendship itself, tends to unfold episodically — with none of the narrative determination of the Marriage Plot, in which young women accrue interest like a mutual fund until they mature into the expected climax: not orgasm but matrimony. There is no such thing as the Friendship Plot, because while friendship, like marriage, is at least presumably a voluntary estate, it has no official consummation, no church- or state-sanctioned vows. It would seem, then, that the literary form most suited to its pick-up-where-we-left-off, drop-me-when-you-couple-up-and-have-kids ebb and flow might be the story cycle, or serial tale — just ask Quixote and Sancho, or Huck and Tom, or the four dudes of “The Three Musketeers.”"

Until recently, the art in Guadalajara has tended toward the folkloric: The town is primarily known for earthen ceramics, as well as for mariachi bands (the genre originated in the region). ‘‘It used to be that creative people got out of here as soon as possible,’’ says the artist Eduardo Sarabia, who moved to Guadalajara from Los Angeles and co-founded an art ‘‘laboratory’’ called PAOS that hosts residencies and exhibits in the stark studio that once belonged to the great Modernist muralist José Clemente Orozco. ‘‘But that’s changed.’’ Sarabia is part of a wave of young artists and gallerists who’re remaking the town into a sort of mellow, sunny-skies utopia. He’s joined by the young Spaniards Silvia Ortiz and Inés López-Quesada, who opened a branch of their Madrid gallery, Travesía Cuatro, in the upscale Colonia Lafayette neighborhood a few years ago in order to be closer to some of their key artists — local talent who have seen their stars rise on the contemporary scene, including Jose Dávila, Gonzalo Lebrija and Jorge Méndez Blake."

The reason is straightforward: A week ago Trump was still averaging, as he’d averaged from the earliest contests onward, about 34 percent of the primary vote. But last night Trump won at least 39 percent of the vote in every state except Ohio, and even there, in his loss to John Kasich, he still came away with more than 35 percent. That five point boost is why he beat Ted Cruz in both Missouri and North Carolina: Cruz reached 40 percent in the former and the high 30s in the latter, which would have been enough to beat Trump in a lot of prior contests, from Michigan to Arkansas to Kentucky … but wasn’t enough to win this time around. And if that boost holds, if Trump’s new average is 40 percent, in a three-way race that could certainly open a path to 1,237 delegates; it’s still a path without a huge margin for error, but it makes his nomination much more likely than when he appeared to be stuck five points lower."

A wider perspective, the acid-eaters tried to explain. A benevolent system. They always seemed half-dead to me, some part of them already partaking in the next world, turned away even as they stared into my face and tried to explain. I once watched one of them almost overdose on laughing gas, leering, muttering nastily at my head, his face blue as day. It was indecent, his romance with death. It should have been private. They all just seemed as if they’d willingly trade life for what might be nothing.

Can science explain their method before it’s lost forever?","At 0400, three miles above the Pacific seafloor, the searchlight of a power boat swept through a warm June night last year, looking for a second boat, a sailing canoe. The captain of the canoe, Alson Kelen, potentially the world’s last-ever apprentice in the ancient art of wave-piloting, was trying to reach Aur, an atoll in the Marshall Islands, without the aid of a GPS device or any other way-finding instrument. If successful, he would prove that one of the most sophisticated navigational techniques ever developed still existed and, he hoped, inspire efforts to save it from extinction. Monitoring his progress from the power boat were an unlikely trio of Western scientists — an anthropologist, a physicist and an oceanographer — who were hoping his journey might help them explain how wave pilots, in defiance of the dizzying complexities of fluid dynamics, detect direction and proximity to land. More broadly, they wondered if watching him sail, in the context of growing concerns about the neurological effects of navigation-by-smartphone, would yield hints about how our orienteering skills influence our sense of place, our sense of home, even our sense of self."

Thirteen Contemporary Artists Portray Their Own Children,2016-03-18,article,News,,"['Art', 'Children and Childhood']","Carrie Mae Weems, Nick Waplington and more share their never-before-published work with T.","As a young person learning her trade, the French artist Élisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (1755-1842) was trained exclusively in portraiture, a properly feminine pursuit. Vigée Le Brun then became a society portraitist, and for more than a century was looked down upon for that. (There’s a drawback to having your lucky break be a commissioned painting of Marie Antoinette.) At first Vigée Le Brun’s stepfather made off with much of her earnings; she then married a charismatic man of taste who again and again spent her money on finery, though he did successfully market Vigée Le Brun as an artist, and arranged high fees for her work. Some said the fees were too high, that she was not that good; others said her work was too good to have actually been done by a woman, that it must in fact have been done by a man, maybe a lover. Perhaps the most predictable of the gripes directed against Vigée Le Brun was Simone de Beauvoir’s: In dismissing a series of female artists, she wrote disparagingly of Vigée Le Brun that she ‘‘never wearied of putting her smiling maternity on her canvases,’’ even though only two of the extant Vigée Le Brun portraits are of herself with her daughter. Admittedly, they are particularly beautiful."

After nearly 700 pages of deposition, when the guilty are finally sorted from the hard-to-call-innocent, many readers will understandably have already lost track of their scorecards. Now, almost 20 years later, Pears’s latest novel presents a complexly interwoven series of narrative entanglements that stretch across time, alternate universes and at least several textual realities — from Elizabethan pastoral romance and multiple universe theory to a Narnia-like fantasy world and Cold War international intrigue. What’s the difference between all these systems of order, knowledge and storytelling? the attentive reader might ask. And the answer might well be: no difference at all.

‘Shuffle Along’ and the Lost History of Black Performance in America,2016-03-24,article,News,,"['Theater', 'Blacks', 'Black People']",Minstrelsy. Blackface. Mugging. Out of this twisted past came one of the first successful all-black Broadway musicals. Now an ambitious revival is bringing it back.,"Ninety-­five years ago in New York, a journalist named Lester Walton bought a ticket to see a much-­buzzed-­about new show, a “musical novelty” that had opened about a week before at the Sixty-­Third Street Theater. Or the Sixty-­Third Street Music Hall, as it was more properly called. A kind of multipurpose performance space, not very big, not very nice, “sandwiched in between garages,” Walton wrote, and “little known to the average Broadway theatergoer.” You could rent the place for the night. It had philosophical lectures, amateur violin recitals and religious meetings, and during the day it showed silent movies: “ ‘Pudd’n Head Wilson,’ with Theodore Roberts, tomorrow.” But on this evening — and for many months to come, as it turned out — the stage belonged to an all-black show called “Shuffle Along,” a comedy with lots of singing and dancing. A problem: The music hall had no orchestra pit, and this show needed an orchestra. It needed space for the band, which happened to include a 25-year-old musician known as Bill Still, later to become the famous composer William Grant Still, but in 1921 a mostly unheard-­of young man from Arkansas, switching among the six or seven instruments he taught himself to play. The production was forced to rip out seats in the front three rows to make room. These were people used to improvising. Among themselves, they referred to the show as “Scuffle Along.”"

As Hank, Mr. Hiddleston leads with charm and a twang, keeping the beat with his shoulders, hips and feet.

"‘Tom Sachs: Tea Ceremony,’ at the Noguchi Museum",2016-03-24,article,Review,,['Art'],"This installation displays constructions relating to the ancient Japanese tradition of chanoyu, the ritualized preparation and serving of tea.","Founded by the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi to preserve and exhibit his art, the Noguchi Museum in Queens has never offered a solo exhibition dedicated to another artist since its opening in 1985. Until now, that is: “Tom Sachs: Tea Ceremony,” an installation of clunky constructions relating to the ancient Japanese tradition of chanoyu, the ritualized preparation and serving of tea, is the first. It sets up an intriguing dialogue with Noguchi’s art, and there will be exhibitions devoted to other artists in the future, which is a good thing for this museum. Showing only Noguchi’s work year after year doesn’t encourage return visits, and it’s exciting to imagine shows of those who have operated in the fertile cross-cultural space between East and West, artists as varied as Ad Reinhardt and Mariko Mori. It’s a good thing for Mr. Sachs, too, as seeing his project in the context of Noguchi’s oeuvre makes it considerably more interesting than it would be on its own."

Face Masks for the Morning — That You Leave on All Day,2016-03-25,article,News,,['Cosmetics and Toiletries'],A new crop of no-rinse products promises to replenish the skin and make it easier to apply makeup.,"The masking hour is, traditionally, a period of required sequestration — a nighttime ritual designed to rebalance your skin in privacy.

A Legendary Photographer (and McQueen Collaborator) Debuts Paintings,2016-03-30,article,News,,"['Art', 'Photography', 'Fashion and Apparel']","The artist Nick Waplington, best known for his backstage fashion work, opens an exhibition this week in L.A. that contains no photos.","The photographer Nick Waplington famously captured Alexander McQueen as he prepared his final winter collection, which became the basis for “Working Process,” a show held last year at the Tate. But Waplington’s latest exhibition, “A Display of Panic in a Moment of Absolute Certainty,” opening Saturday at the Los Angeles gallery These Days, contains no snapshots whatsoever — rather, it is comprised solely of paintings and drawings. Much like the McQueen series, which the designer wanted to be “dirty and messy,” Waplington’s new work reveals a constant concern of his 30-year career: an affinity for barely contained chaos, whether in garbage dumps, the hills above the West Bank city of Ramallah or the maelstrom of fashion shows. None of the paintings in the show, Waplington’s first stateside exhibition sans photography, have a single vantage point, a conscious choice to make it “deliberately difficult to perceive order,” he explains. “My paintings deal with this inner world, whereas my photographic work deals with the world around me,” says Waplington, who will appear Thursday in New York at the Rizzoli bookstore alongside Isaac Mizrahi, whose backstage scene he documented every season from 1989 to 1993. “I guess the basic difference is with photography the canvas is full and with painting it’s empty. Both give me problems.”"

"Review: ‘Miles Ahead,’ an Impressionistic Take on Miles Davis",2016-03-31,article,Review,,['Movies'],"Don Cheadle stars in — and directed — this biopic about the jazz trumpeter, who was a sly chameleon, both in his life and in his music.","There’s a hopped-up scene in “Miles Ahead,” controlled yet frenzied, when you get why Don Cheadle decided to go for broke. He’s playing Miles Davis (he also directed) and the time is the late 1970s — although it’s also the 1960s. Time and space tend to blur in this movie and while the setting is a ’70s boxing match, a couple of figures from Miles’s past — his wife, his younger self — soon swing in to shake things up. She’s running scared and the 1970s Miles is running amok, but the younger Miles, well, there he is, too, playing it cool in the ring. Music is fighting, at least for this pugilist."

He tackles big, capitalized themes — Power, Art, Virtue, Evil — but his films speak in whispers, murmurs and ruminative pauses. They often feel as intimate and inscrutable as diary entries, even when they deal with monstrous public figures like Hitler, Stalin and Hirohito. Mr. Sokurov forgoes sweeping pictorial gestures and period pageantry in favor of quiet lyricism and tight, sometimes claustrophobic compositions. He thinks a lot about history, and in his best work you can hear history thinking."
