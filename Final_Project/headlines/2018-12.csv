Why the U.S. Should Not Assist Italy in Forfeiting a Rare Bronze ,2018-12-10,article,Op-Ed,,['Museums'],The Justice Department has helped many countries gain back their rightful cultural possessions. This is a case that doesn’t warrant its involvement.,"In recent years, museums in the United States have surrendered antiquities to numerous countries after determining that the objects had been illicitly acquired. Those restitutions were necessary: no museum should retain a work that was stolen or transferred in violation of international law or treaty obligations. Due diligence in acquiring an antiquity requires, at a minimum, documentation of where it was discovered in modern times and its subsequent movements across national borders. Applying those standards is not always easy and, at least until recently, often not undertaken with appropriate thoroughness. There is, though, a notable exception: the J. Paul Getty Museum’s 1977 purchase of “Statue of a Victorious Youth,” a Greek statue known as the Getty Bronze that Italy is claiming as its own."

It is rustic American, strongly farm-to-table (farms are about an hour away), with dishes like Honeycrisp apples with delicata squash and country ham; mussels in white wine cream with fennel and turmeric; grilled squid with chickpeas, celery and Aleppo pepper; grilled swordfish with white beans and oven-roasted tomatoes; and smoked short ribs with polenta. Claudia Fleming, an owner of North Fork Table who was the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern, is overseeing the desserts. Mr. Colicchio expects to have local wines, beers and spirits on the drinks list.

It’s directly across the street from his restaurant Surf, which, despite its name, is more about turf, and has a sibling for barbecue in Rumson, N.J. Mr. Rallo’s partner in the new venture is Dave Pasternack, the executive chef and an owner of Esca, the long-running Italian seafood magnet in Manhattan. So it comes as no surprise that Mr. Rallo’s executive chef is Katie O’Donnell, who was a chef de cuisine at Esca several years ago. Offerings like a crudo tasting, spicy spaghetti with lobster, and Sicilian-style fish stew with sea urchin and crab meat echo some of Esca’s specialties. But there are also baked clams with pancetta, swordfish Milanese-style, a chicken breast and a pork chop. The restaurant, with windows all around, features blue accents and glass. It has a dramatically backlit wall of mostly Italian wines, white marble tabletops and some industrial touches. (Opens Wednesday)"

Meet Brut I.P.A.,2018-12-21,article,News,,['Beer'],"A style of beer, invented last year at a brewpub in San Francisco, combines bone-dry aspect of a Champagne in an India Pale Ale.","It’s taken a little over a year for Brut I.P.A., a new style of India Pale Ale, to sweep through the craft-brewing community. The name is a reference to brut, a dry Champagne. By all accounts, it was created by Kim Sturdavant, the brewmaster of Social Kitchen and Brewery in San Francisco, who used amyloglucosidase, or AMG, to remove the sugars in an I.P.A. AMG is an enzyme usually added to make light beers and to balance big beers like imperial stouts. Some New York brewers — including Sixpoint, Five Boroughs, Greenpoint, and Ommegang in central New York — are now making Brut I.P.A.s. Sam Adams introduced its Brut I.P.A. in June, and it also makes a rosé Brut I.P.A. There are now hundreds of them being made nationwide. Stylistically, there are variations in flavor, color and texture, but most are crisp, light and somewhat citric. A glass of the bubbly, golden Brut I.P.A. would not be out of place for a toast at the ball drop. “They’re the opposite of juicy, sweet New England I.P.A.s,” said Kevin Brooks, the manager of the Lower East Side beer store Top Hops, which carries several Brut I.P.A.s. “With national brands like Ommegang, you’ll see them everywhere; it’s a new all-American style,” said Chris Chou-Messina, who is the director of craft innovation at Anheuser-Busch. Ms. Chou-Messina will lead a class in Brut I.P.A. at Top Hops on March 12."

Bad Weather Leads to a New Olive Oil,2018-12-31,article,News,,"['Olive Oil', 'Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Oils and Fats']",California Olive Ranch now blends its lower-priced California offerings with oils from around the globe.,"Extreme weather conditions led the California Olive Ranch in Chico, Calif., to take the unusual step of making a line of California extra-virgin olive oils blended with oils from other countries. The Destination Series — Everyday, Mild & Buttery and Rich & Robust — was created to convey the same flavor profiles as the company’s previous 100 percent California oils, which had the same names as these new blends. The move offsets a harvest that Gregg Kelley, the company’s chief executive, called “a disaster” because of the unseasonably cold winter of 2017-18. Collaborations with growers in Argentina, Chile and Portugal were developed several years ago in anticipation of olive harvest problems. The company blended the oil with the aim of not letting any region’s characteristics dominate, though Mr. Kelley said at least 26 percent of the oil in each bottle is from California, making it the largest component by just a shade. The oils are reasonably priced, like the ones they replace, and pleasant but hardly distinctive, with the one called Everyday the most useful for many cooking purposes. The company still makes more expensive 100 percent California oils."

Fish and assorted seafood are significant components on the menu, which Ms. Kwak oversees as chef.

Pillowy, sugar-dusted beignets are a signature sweet. Ms. Kwak’s mother, Myung Ja Kwak, who owned the other restaurants, has retired, though she is still making the kimchi."
