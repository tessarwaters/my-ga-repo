The reason: the seasonal displays, which have become increasingly elaborate since the late 19th century, when Macy’s reportedly first decorated its plate-glass facade with scenes from “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Led by modern dream makers such as Dennis Freedman of Barneys New York and David Hoey of Bergdorf Goodman, today’s stores spare little expense to create over-the-top tableaux, employing hundreds of design elves and calling on celebrity “curators” from Baz Luhrmann to Lady Gaga to bring the magical mise-en-scènes to life.

(Starz) THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 (2014) With New York held hostage by Oscorp, it’s up to Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), a.k.a. Spider-Man, to come to the rescue of the city he vowed to protect in this second installment in Mark Webb’s franchise, based on the Marvel comic. Emma Stone returns as Peter’s love interest, Gwen Stacy; Jamie Foxx is Electro, the latest disgruntled employee turned monster; Dane DeHaan is Harry Osborn, Peter’s frenemy; and Sally Field is Aunt May. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that this sequel, “until a late, lamentably foolish turn, balances blockbuster bombast with human-scale drama, child-friendly comedy and gushers of tears.” Mr. Garfield, “who’s making a career out of playing delicate flowers, fits the role, suit and moist sniffling fine,” she added. But “Mr. Webb seems to have been hired mostly to keep Sony’s Spider machine going, a tricky task, given that the character doesn’t have the mythic grandeur and gravity that make Batman and Superman seem endlessly exploitable,” she added, comparing Spider-Man to Hamlet. It “goes without saying that while some superheroes are born great, others need to have greatness thrust upon them.”"

It might have been the Greenwich Village folk scene of the late 1950s, the post-Newport electric period or “Blood on the Tracks.” It could even be the resurgent late phase from “Time Out of Mind” onward. The flip side of this is that at some point people lose interest in Dylan. For every entry point, there’s an equally convenient exit. Loss of interest rarely proves terminal, however, especially since 1991, when his continuing recording career began to proceed in tandem with a slow drip of “official” bootleg releases (most recently: “The Basement Tapes Complete”)."

How else to react to, say, “Sex and Death/Double ‘69,’ ” one of his trademark neon sculptures, which arrays four figures of indeterminate gender in an arrangement (two hang down between two standing) felicitous for simultaneous oral and genital copulation by both pairs?

"‘Fragrant,’ by Mandy Aftel",2014-12-05,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Smell (Olfaction)']",An artisan perfumer urges us to “regain an authentic connection to the sense of smell.”,"Why do we like our chewing gum to taste of mint? The herb grows abundantly on nearly all continents and has long been used as a curative for a variety of conditions. The Japanese once considered mint an effective form of birth control. In the Trobriand Islands, it served as a love charm. The ancient Greeks thought it could end hiccups. And the Romans believed a crown of fresh mint placed atop one’s head would serve to stimulate the mind. In several cultures, mint was recommended as an aid to calm upset stomachs, a practice that explains the longstanding tradition of serving after-dinner mints. But perhaps the crisp, bright smell of mint and the cooling sensation of menthol in the mouth are what make it so refreshing to the palate. When, in the 1890s, William Wrigley Jr. added chewing gum to his line of soaps and baking powder, he tried the brilliant idea of mixing spearmint and peppermint oils with the chicle he was importing from Latin America. Soon his gum was a hit — and a minty-fresh flavor industry was born. "

Humor,2014-12-05,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Comedy and Humor']","New books by Bob Odenkirk, Mallory Ortberg and others.","Most art doesn’t command attention past a generation or two, because most art isn’t very good. Nonetheless, it sometimes feels as if comedy in any guise — written, visual, staged, filmed — is the most evanescent art form of all, especially given the binary response it provokes, either amusing you or not. A book or painting or drama that no longer speaks to us can be shrugged off, but an unfunny joke grates — comedy might be dismissed by some as a lower art form, but in a weird way we hold it to a higher standard. Thus comic strips or stand-up routines that made Grandma and Grandpa laugh can strike the present day as not just dated but downright embarrassing or even, depending on the butt of a joke, shameful; whatever wit an old laugh line possessed can curdle across decades to the point that its rank mirthlessness becomes a kind of KICK ME sign taped to the past’s back. Think of punning he-she jokes from the pre-Henry Luce Life magazine, or racist shtick out of a golden-age Hollywood movie, or the fact that “The Beverly Hillbillies” was once the top-rated show on television — and cringe for our ancestors."

Dorothy survived a gunshot and ­typhus; nearly froze and starved. After she was liberated by Russians and traveled (on a ship that almost capsized) to relatives in Wilmington, Del., she had a skirt suit custom-made with wool that had been salvaged from the department store — an incalculably precious memento of her early life — but wore it only a few times. “I didn’t love how it fit,” she tells the author, Emily Spivack."

(His latest, “The Slow Regard of Silent Things,” spent a month on the hardcover fiction list before falling, this week, to No. 20 on the extended list.) Rothfuss is also the driving force behind a charity called Worldbuilders, which uses auctions, giveaways and “good old-fashioned ballyhoo,” as he put it in a recent phone conversation, to benefit the anti­poverty organization Heifer International. ­Ballyhoo? “Cool people doing weird things,” Rothfuss explained. For instance, when donations to the current fund drive reached $150,000, Worldbuilders posted a video of the author Myke Cole reviewing “Hedging His Bets,” a work of ­were-hedgehog erotica. (“It’s nice to know that, at least in the world of sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-genre literature, we’re forging into bold new territory,” Cole said.) When donations reached $325,000, the “Eragon” author Christopher Paolini recited a story that has entered the so-bad-it’s-good fantasy canon. And when the drive ends at midnight on Monday, if donations have exceeded last year’s total of $681,000, Rothfuss himself has pledged to kiss an animal chosen by his Twitter followers. “It looks overwhelmingly like it will be a llama,” he said. “I’m a little nervous about that, actually. Alpacas are warm and fuzzy, like kittens. Llamas are like Viking warriors. People use them to guard their livestock. I anticipate being trampled to death.”"

Nicknamed John the Baptist for his visionary intensity, Marchand sailed a steamer up a tributary of the Congo River into the African interior, grinding to a halt where the river ran out on a plateau 130 miles from the Nile. Marchand’s porters sawed the steamer into sections, laid wooden tracks through the jungle and carried the boat and their gear — including 90,000 rounds of ammunition and hundreds of kegs of fine French wine — for months across the divide. By the time they reached the Nile, the British Army had slaughtered thousands of Sudanese soldiers at the battle of Omdurman and solidified its control over the river’s upper reaches.

Fiona Ritchie, the host of NPR’s “The Thistle and Shamrock,” and Doug Orr, the founder of the Swannanoa Gathering music workshops, have put together a gorgeous holiday gift book, including a CD of various artists’ renditions of the songs whose origins the authors so beautifully recount. “Wayfaring Strangers” tells the story of how Scottish immigrants to Ulster in Northern Ireland merged their own musical traditions with those of the Irish before coming to America and adding their music to the American songbook. These Scotch-Irish immigrants moved principally to Appalachia, where their traditions took new forms in classics like “Barbara Allen” and “Shady Grove.” As Dolly Parton writes in her introduction, “I grew up in the Smoky Mountains listening to these ancient ballads that had crossed oceans and valleys,” songs that became the basis for folk, bluegrass and country music."
‘The Image of the Black in Western Art’,2014-12-05,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Art', 'Blacks', 'Black People']",Claudia Rankine reviews the latest and perhaps last volume in Dominique de Menil’s monumental archival project.,"Dominique de Menil’s monumental archival project of collecting and documenting the “image of the black in Western art” began in the 1960s as an aesthetic form of resistance to anti-black racism at the height of the civil rights movement. But with the publication of the fifth volume, concentrating on the 20th century, it has become a necessary cultural resource documenting the visual construction of blackness over the past 5,000 years. This latest and perhaps last volume — subdivided into two parts, “The Impact of Africa” and “The Rise of Black Artists” — redirects the underlying colonialist, Eurocentric framing of the previous four volumes. The co-editors, David Bindman and Henry Louis Gates Jr., bring focus to black artists globally as makers of their own art and imagery, rather than solely the subjects of others’ fantasies and fascination. Though some attention is paid to overtly racist imagery popular in the first half of the 20th century, the books as a pair stand in line with de Menil’s original, corrective intent to assert presence. Given the volumes’ title and the original terms of de Menil’s archival project, a reader could not be faulted for anticipating a salon installation of numerous images — but in fact, brilliant essays by the likes of Deborah Willis, Christian Weikop, Petrine Archer and many other noted scholars richly motivate this endeavor."

Benjamin’s recent descendants include the likes of Jonathan ­Lethem (who assembled an entire Harper’s Magazine essay about plagiarism using other sources), David Shields (whose manifesto, “Reality Hunger,” is similarly Frankensteined together) and now the Canadian author Diane Schoemperlen, the author of several story collections and three novels.

He made his mark in the ’70s, when he haunted print shops and auction houses and assembled a major collection. Eccentric and wide-ranging, his holdings mingled classic images from the 19th century — misty views of French forests, soulful portraits of poets — with contemporary images of brazen eroticism. Was photography art? Wagstaff’s lover, Robert Mapplethorpe, answered the question with a vengeance, yoking an austere, nearly arctic elegance to images of flowers, male nudes and the rituals of sadomasochism. "

Even when Poehler does sleep, she wakes herself up 20 to 30 times a night (according to a Beverly Hills sleep clinic) and, apparently, snores “like a dragon.” She freely allows that “Yes Please” is a “spontaneous overflow in the middle of chaos, not tranquillity,” a thing written on subways and planes, “ugly and in pieces.” And in the end, no apologies.

However, there are a number of works on view in the week’s namesake fair — which is open until Sunday at the Miami Beach Convention Center — that simultaneously reify the glamour industry and parody it, co-opting the language of glossy magazines to present fashion portraits as art. At Berlin’s Société gallery in Art Basel’s Nova section (dedicated to “new” galleries), Timur Si-Qin’s light box of three sinewy youths in a bright, bucolic setting catches the lens in precisely the style of an Abercrombie & Fitch ad. The shot is blown up from Si-Qin’s artist book, which resembles a complete A&F catalog, replacing the iconic initials with his own yin-yang “peace” logo. Reena Spaulings Fine Art from New York has a number of works on view by the feminist provocateur K8 Hardy, including a large-scale reproduction of her underground zine from the early aughts, “Fashion Fashion,” inflecting the language of the women’s magazine with a post-riot-grrrl conceptual wit. Another Berlin gallery, Contemporary Fine Arts, is showing the largest cover among the three as a central feature of its booth. Not even for sale (or so the gallery says), Juergen Teller’s shot of Stella Tennant in men’s briefs, a hooded robe and trainers is intended to draw attention to the booth as much as to contribute to its context — a harmony heard loud and clear all around town."

But after being stopped by the authorities in Calais, on the French side of the Channel, he decides to swim for it.

Margaret Talbot of The New Yorker puts it succinctly: “If this story does turn out to be largely false, it will do real damage to the important new movement to crack down on sexual assault on college campuses.” And Hanna Rosin of Slate worries that UVA, “which seemed to be on the cusp of making changes at the school to better protect women from sexual assault,” might scuttle those changes if the allegations in the story don’t hold up."

"‘Family Furnishings,’ Selected Stories by Alice Munro",2014-12-10,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Alice Munro’s later stories seem driven by a pure curiosity about other people’s journeys through life.,"For the protagonists of Alice Munro’s stories — mostly women, usually Canadian, never quite content — it can be tough to get from one place to another, from where they are to where they’d rather be. There are no direct flights, no express buses or trains in the world her characters move through: They always have to change somewhere. The narrator of “Home,” one of the two dozen stories culled here from collections published in the last two decades, has to take three buses to visit her aging father and annoying stepmother and to learn a small thing about herself. Others in “Family Furnishings” have longer, harder journeys, with more ambiguous rewards: a new country, an uncomfortable truth, a difficult love. Some of Munro’s pilgrims, like the unhappy wife in “Runaway,” go part of the way and then turn back. But most just keep going: looking at the passing world, drifting in and out of the strange kind of contemplation travel can induce, until they’ve reached their destination."

What’s on TV Friday,2014-12-12,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) TRUST ME (2014) Clark Gregg (“Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”) wrote, directed and stars in this black comedy about Hollywood wheeling and dealing, centered on Howard Holloway, a floundering agent specializing in child actors. He should know: Howard used to be one himself, until his career sank 36 years earlier with a Jan-Michael Vincent surf movie that was never made. But a chance meeting with a wildly talented 13-year-old from Oklahoma (Saxon Sharbino) with a controlling, alcoholic father (Paul Sparks) might be his road to redemption. Felicity Huffman plays the producer of a new vampire franchise, and Allison Janney is her casting director, both of whom loathe Howard; Sam Rockwell is his client-poaching archrival. “The performances and some of the writing are the movie’s strongest elements,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. Ms. Sharbino “has the radiance and skills to be a teenage megastar in a ‘Twilight'-like series.” He said Mr. Gregg “succeeds in finding some humanity inside a dislikable creep.” But “as the movie picks up speed and undergoes sudden, confusing plot reversals, it loses its satirical edge,” he added. “You can’t help wondering if the production ran out of money while racing to meet a deadline.”"

Fiber Art: Long Way From the Loom,2014-12-12,article,News,,['Art'],Contemporary fiber art has a history of being set apart from — and by implication beneath — painting and sculpture.,"Contemporary fiber art has a history of being set apart from — and by implication beneath — painting and sculpture. It’s been decades since the last major museum show devoted to it, but even a quick tour of “Fiber: Sculpture 1960-Present” at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, tells us what we’ve been missing. If you’re thinking braided rugs and samplers, think again. Much of the work in this survey of 33 artists is spectacularly space filling. A suspended three-dimensional sculpture of knotted sisal by the Croatian artist Jagoda Buic is as big as a ballroom chandelier. A new work by the great Sheila Hicks pours down, a Niagara of silk and linen cords, from the ceiling. Some of the quietest things are the most beautiful, like Lenore Tawney’s revolutionary open-weave “Dark River” from 1961. A gorgeous yarn piece by Sheila Pepe that rises and falls with the museum’s elevator, is moving in every sense. (Through Jan. 4, icaboston.org.

Inside the List,2014-12-12,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"“The Beatles ­Lyrics,” No. 15 on the hardcover nonfiction list, includes handwritten drafts, including crossouts and false starts.","Yeah Yeah Yeah: Shortly before it imploded earlier this month, the venerable old magazine — sorry, “vertically integrated digital media company” — The New Republic observed its centennial with a list of the 20th century’s leading thinkers across a range of disciplines: the top philosopher, the top economist, the top diplomat and so on. John Lennon and Paul McCartney did not win in the songwriting category; that honor went to Bob Dylan instead. But they were among the runners-up, and in its citation to explain why, the new New Republic made the kind of gaffe the old New Republic would probably have avoided: Two of the three Beatles songs it alluded to weren’t written by Lennon or McCartney. (“There was something in the way they came together,” the citation read, “the way they moved, the way they twisted and shouted.” But George Harrison wrote “Something,” while “Twist and Shout” isn’t a Beatles original at all; it was written by Phil Medley and Bert Berns. The one song the magazine got right, more or less, was “Come Together.”) The Beatles fare better in a new book by their longtime Boswell, Hunter Davies, whose collection “The Beatles ­Lyrics” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 15. In gathering as many handwritten drafts as he could, including crossouts and false starts, Davies traces the evolution of some of rock ‘n’ roll’s most enduring songs. “The further we get from them,” he writes of the Beatles in his introduction, “the bigger they become.” Davies’s book has been greeted with almost religious devotion in some quarters. “When the lyrics, like those for ‘The Word’ and ‘Baby You’re a Rich Man,’ include multi­colored doodlings by a presumably stoned author,” Andy Gill wrote in the British newspaper The Independent recently, “they’re like the primitivist equivalent of illuminated manuscripts.”"
"‘Victoria: A Life,’ by A. N. Wilson",2014-12-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A. N. Wilson’s biography of the British monarch who reigned for more than six decades.,"In 1819, when the future Queen Victoria was born, few observers could have predicted that she would become the subject of several hundred biographies. A. N. Wilson’s addition to this library, “Victoria: A Life,” is a story of success against what looked at first like overwhelming odds. His Cinderella-like heroine grew up fatherless, a poor relation surrounded by warring court factions. Still a teenager when the death of successive relatives left her to inherit her uncle’s throne, Victoria was faced with a series of fragile coalition governments, labor unrest at home, a famine in Ireland, revolutions on the other side of the Channel, a spectacularly mismanaged war in the Crimea — and that’s just in the first two decades.

"‘There Must Be Some Mistake,’ by Frederick Barthelme",2014-12-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Frederick Barthelme’s novel, residents of a Texas condo development are meeting untimely ends at an alarming rate.","If you’re hoping to get to know your neighbors in Forgetful Bay, a condo development near the Texas Gulf Coast, you’d better act quickly, since they’re going belly up with remarkable frequency. Consider the fate of the nail-salon tycoon, Mr. Ng, who flipped his Mercedes, which promptly burst into flames, or the ex-Marine Duncan Parker, who was planning to lose his ­Amazon-size wife but by the time the last bullet was fired ended up losing himself. Then, of course, there are the perfectly “normal” deaths brought about by bad hearts and other medical conditions, the kind that were responsible for the collapse of the neighbor found in his car “with the door open and one foot out on the concrete of the garage floor,” with “no signs of violence of any kind.” But it’s not easy distinguishing a normal death from an abnormal one in Forgetful Bay, where only one thing is ever certain — if you’re looking to move in, several of the nicer units should be available real soon."

"‘A Country Called Childhood,’ by Jay Griffiths",2014-12-12,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Children and Childhood']","Andrew Solomon reviews a new book by Jay Griffiths, who says contemporary society denies children the freedoms of space, time and the natural world.","You know less than you think you do. The constant reinforcement of that sorry idea has become a drumbeat under parenting, as advice books of every kind pullulate like toadstools after a storm. Such literature sets out to refocus your daily life with your child, usually with proscriptive rebukes and optimistic exercises — with easy-sounding answers that are often impossible to enact. Anyone who has raised a child will know how assaultive the abundance of such parenting advice can feel, how dreary it is to be told constantly that if you only did (or, indeed, had done) something slightly different, your child’s problems would evanesce, and you would have, through the alchemy of nurture, a child who is happy / well behaved / nonviolent / good at math / successful / self-­motivated / popular / thin.

While the silliness of “quantum spirituality” is apparent enough these days, the possibility that Eastern traditions might have something to say to science did not disappear. Instead, a more natural locus for that encounter was found in the study of the mind. Spurred by the Dalai Lama’s remarkable engagement with scientists, interest in Buddhist attitudes toward the study of the mind has grown steadily. "

Since then a few new gems have turned up, mainly from papyri found in the rubbish dumps of the Egyptian town Oxyrhynchus. Here was found, for example, a tattered verse by Sappho and Pindar’s paeans to Apollo. It is unlikely, however, that many more great works of classical European literature will surface; the canon of ancient European literature we have now is likely to remain largely unchanged a century hence.

"‘Joan of Arc,’ by Kathryn Harrison",2014-12-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Kathryn Harrison’s biography interweaves Joan of Arc’s story with both fictional and historical interpretations.,"It remains, after nearly 600 years, a story to break your heart. In the 1420s, in a village in northeastern France, an illiterate teenage peasant girl has a series of visions telling her that God wants her to lead a French army to lift the English siege of Orléans and help crown the dauphin, Charles, king in the cathedral at Reims. Putting on men’s clothing and winning over everyone by force of character and belief, she gets her army and triumphantly achieves all that the voices have foretold. Pious, outspoken, stubborn and recklessly courageous, she breaks every rule of gender, class and organized religion, and the people flock to her. Then comes her fall. Sidelined at court, she waits too long to launch an unsuccessful attack on English-occupied Paris, during which she is wounded, and then in a skirmish at Compiègne she is captured. Abandoned by the king, she is cruelly imprisoned, tried as a heretic and witch, then burned at the stake. The light of revelation ends in the agony of fire, and the legend of Joan of Arc is born."

Raphaël Jerusalmy’s ‘Brotherhood of Book Hunters’,2014-12-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],François Villon travels to Jerusalem in this literary mystery.,"No matter how often academics kill the author, dedicated readers will resurrect him. The sense that artworks hide meanings only their creators could know nags so continuously at the imagination that a sizable subgenre of literary mystery has grown to satisfy it. If some artists’ lives encouraged this (there are at least three contradictory reports of Caravaggio’s death), others have it thrust upon them: Nothing about Noël Coward justifies his appearance as a detective in “The Noël Coward Murder Mysteries,” for example, any more than Abraham Lincoln ever killed a vampire, so far as we know — but fame has unpredictable penalties."

1914: France Silences Enemy Guns Near Arras,2014-12-21,article,News,,['World War I (1914-18)'],"From the International Herald Tribune archives: After intense German shelling near Arras in 1914, the French fight back.","LONDON — Arras is once more the centre of severe fighting, and that fine city of the north of France, so many of whose artistic or historic monuments are already in ruins, has received further punishment from the pitiless German shells. Having already destroyed the belfry of the famous church, the Germans are now probably bent on leaving not one stone of it upon another. But although the army of “Kultur” may destroy the beauties of helpless French cities, it is having no success when opposing itself to the French troops. In front of Arras the French artillery threw such a rain of shells into the enemy’s lines that no fewer than thirty-six cannon were silenced. Immediately after the infantry advanced, and after a hand-to-hand fight gained several trenches. The cavalry also took a distinguished part, the cuirassiers nailing the German artillerymen at their guns. Not satisfied with working further havoc in Arras, the Germans have also had recourse to another one of their favorite diversions, and have bombarded the hospital in Ypres. Such tactics on the part of the Germans generally indicate that they can make no headway in legitimate fighting. This view is, in fact, frankly expressed by a war correspondent of the “Berliner Tageblatt.” — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 22, 1914"

What’s on TV Sunday,2014-12-21,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"3:15 P.M. (Showtime 2) LEE DANIELS’ THE BUTLER (2013) Inspired by the real story of Eugene Allen, Mr. Daniels follows a White House butler, Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), and his wife, Gloria (Oprah Winfrey), as history — particularly the civil rights movement — unfolds over seven presidential administrations. A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called the film “a brilliantly truthful movie on a subject that is usually shrouded in wishful thinking, mythmongering and outright denial.” Robin Williams portrays Dwight D. Eisenhower; Liev Schreiber is Lyndon B. Johnson; and Alan Rickman is Ronald Reagan, with Jane Fonda as his wife, Nancy; Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz are the fellow butlers who become Cecil’s close friends; and David Oyelowo is the older son whose politics Cecil eschews. “In part, their story is a chronicle of the generational misunderstanding that has occurred in upwardly mobile families of every background, especially in the baby boom era, when educated and restless young people turned against the parents who had sacrificed so much on their behalf,” Mr. Scott wrote. “ 'The Butler’ has the historical insight and the generosity of spirit to honor the father and the son equally, and to look with skepticism at each’s point of view.” He added: “We remember those who marched and who stood up for themselves in the face of injustice. It is good to remember that, to paraphrase Milton, they also stand who only wait and serve.”"

Today’s two votes made the current presidential election the longest in the 18-year-old history of the Italian Republic.

He joined the government of Premier Aldo Moro last year in its “opening to the left.” Former Premier Giovanni Leone, the official Christian Democrat candidate, polled 299 votes tonight — six less than in the ninth ballot this morning.

(TMC) HAPPY-GO-LUCKY (2008) The irrepressible optimism of a 30-year-old London schoolteacher (Sally Hawkins, above) grates on those whose days she’s intent on brightening up — among them, her driving instructor (Eddie Marsan), flamenco teacher (Karina Fernandez) and sister (Caroline Martin) — in this character study directed and written by Mike Leigh, which earned him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Ms. Hawkins’s portrayal is “glorious,” a “gurgling, burbling stream of gasps, giggles and words,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, choosing the film as a critic’s pick. “Mr. Leigh has a documentarian’s eye for unadorned reality — his people and places look equally lived in — and his dialogue has the ebb and flow, the swells and eddies and logjams of ordinary conversation,” she added. “But the dramatist in Mr. Leigh is always hard at work, aligning his characters for maximum narrative effect and emotional pow. That’s true even if ‘Happy-Go-Lucky’ seems as lighthearted as the bobbing bloom at its center.” "

David Orr’s 10 Favorite Poetry Books of 2014,2014-12-22,article,News,,"['Poetry and Poets', 'Books and Literature']","Books by Louise Glück, Fanny Howe, Christian Wiman and others.","When it comes to annual best-books lists, poetry is the cat that wandered into the dog show. No matter how much one tries, as The Times does, to include poets among the various biographers, essayists, novelists and so forth, it’s hard not to feel that poetry is fundamentally different from prose of any stripe. (Prose, said Coleridge, is “words in their best order,” whereas poetry is “the best words in their best order” — but then, Coleridge was a poet.) So here are 10 American poetry collections published in 2014 that I would recommend not only to poetry veterans, but to readers coming to the form with limited experience. In keeping with Times policy, this list includes no friends, lovers, babysitters or college roommates. (If I were allowed to include friends, my list would certainly include Maureen McLane’s “This Blue,” which was a finalist for the National Book Award.) In the interests of spreading the wealth, I’ve also generally favored work by poets I haven’t written about already."

What’s on TV Wednesday,2014-12-24,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8:45 A.M. (HBO2) ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004) Beneath glum, gray skies in suburban New York, deeply wounded adults find each other, love each other and take extraordinary medical measures to forget each other. Joel (Jim Carrey) is a man as dull and listless as the weather, and Clem (Kate Winslet, exuding wounded charm) is a brilliant and scatterbrained young woman who briefly makes his existence pop. They may have known each other once before; the script, written by Charlie Kaufman, reveals the truth of the on-screen relationships slowly and with obvious glee. Clem and Joel and who-knows-how-many of the other characters have turned to a process developed by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to burn away their most hurtful memories of each other. Much of the film’s second half is set within Joel’s mind, as he witnesses his memories’ destruction in real time. “This entire section is breathtakingly realized,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, “melting several bad dreams into one.” Michel Gondry’s “swift, improvised direction bleaches the portentousness from the conception.”"

Judging by present portents, it is probable that the plum puddings will be eaten under fire.

What’s on TV Friday,2014-12-26,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"1 P.M. (TMC) FRUITVALE STATION (2013) In the small hours of New Year’s Day, 2009, an unarmed young black man named Oscar Grant III, handcuffed and lying on his belly, was shot and killed by a white police officer in the Fruitvale subway station in Oakland, Calif. The director Ryan Coogler’s first feature film, which won a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, carefully reconstructs the last 24 hours of Mr. Grant’s life. Michael B. Jordan (“Friday Night Lights,” “The Wire”) gives Mr. Grant “a fully human presence,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, “acknowledging his complexities and contradictions.” The film is steady, subtle and seldom moralistic, Mr. Scott wrote, which is what gives it its power. “The climactic encounter with BART police officers erupts in a mood of vertiginous uncertainty, defusing facile or inflammatory judgments and bending the audience’s reflexive emotional horror and moral outrage toward a necessary and difficult ethical inquiry. How could this have happened? How did we — meaning any one of us who might see faces like our own depicted on that screen — allow it?”"

Ken Schles, 54, spent the mid-1980s living and taking photographs in the East Village, and twice he edited his work into books — the first time when the photos were taken, and the second time more recently. The differences in mood are striking. The first book, “Invisible City” (1988), which Mr. Schles created while living on a drug-ravaged block on Avenue B, reflects the turmoil and death in his life at the time. “My friends were dying of AIDS, and I was living in an abandoned building,” he said. A quarter of a century later, when he went back to the work, it was as someone who had survived the era, and the images revealed themselves to him in a different light. The resulting book, “Night Walk” (2014), is the retrospective glance of a father of two living in Fort Greene, in Brooklyn. It is “much more about the people and the vitality,” he said. “There’s an excitement about going out. In ‘Invisible City,’ there’s a darkness to the book.”"

1914: Christmas Shows in London,2014-12-26,article,News,,['Culture (Arts)'],From the International Herald Tribune archives: Theaters in London put on Christmas shows in 1914.,"LONDON — Sir Herbert Tree’s production of ‘‘David Copperfield,’’ adapted by Mr. Louis N. Parker, was given its initial performance at His Majesty’s Theatre on Thursday evening [Dec. 24], and it proved a rare Christmas Eve treat. Sir Herbert, in the dual role of Micawber and Daniel Peggotty, was never seen to better advantage, and the difficult task of adapting Dickens for the stage was carried out remarkably well. There was a great ovation at the end, and the audience insisted upon a speech from Sir Herbert, who replied with the modesty of a schoolgirl, but with evident gratitude. Judging from the dress rehearsal of the ‘‘Sleeping Beauty Re-Awakened,’’ at Drury Lane, this pantomime will be a great favorite of the festive season. During one of the intervals, the band played ‘‘Tipperary,’’ and everyone in the audience joined in with such relish that encore after encore followed. At the Lyceum, Miss Louise Beckman will be the hero of ‘‘Jack and the Beanstalk,’’ and Miss Doris Dean will be the pretty princess. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 26, 1914"

I generally have no problem falling asleep; the 6:30 alarm on school mornings takes care of that. But lately, sometime between 3:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. every night, I find myself conscious. I know the alarm is poised to cut off any relief at the other end, so I must get back to sleep, yet I can’t. My wife has been experiencing lacunas in her slumber as well, and often one’s will exacerbate the other’s. I didn’t think she had my sleep problem, but I guess she does now. I don’t know if she thinks I gave it to her; I think she does. I may have. I know she thinks I gave it to the kids. And so another roadblock on my path back to senselessness."

Inside the List,2014-12-26,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Marie Kondo’s “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up” admonishes readers to get rid of any belongings that fail to “spark joy.”,"The Minimalist: You say you want a resolution? Over on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list, the usual categories are doing well — healthy eating, financial management, the collected wisdom of Oprah Winfrey — but so is one of the barmier housekeeping guides in recent memory: Marie Kondo’s “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up” (No. 5 after eight weeks), which admonishes readers to get rid of any belongings that fail to “spark joy.” Kondo is something of a sensation in her native Japan, where her decluttering system has been featured in a TV movie and created such demand for her services that she’s temporarily stopped accepting new clients. It’s easy to see the appeal: Who couldn’t use a nudge to re-evaluate their tottering piles of stuff? But Kondo’s obsessive-compulsive asceticism comes wrapped in a moony New Age haze that recommends, for instance, thanking your shoes for their hard work or communing with your outfits by fondling them. “It is very natural for me to say thank you to the goods that support us,” Kondo told The Associated Press recently. “The inside of a house or apartment after decluttering has much in common with a Shinto shrine, . . . a place where there are no unnecessary things, and our thoughts become clear.” Maybe so. But if I had to deep-six everything in my house that didn’t spark joy, I might be left with nothing but chocolate, beer and — still — far too many books."

Indianapolis, the Navy ship that was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine days after delivering materials for the first atomic bomb. Quint’s tale of sailors drowned and devoured by sharks is so ghoulish and riveting it’s easy to miss a detail he shared before telling it: He’s had his Indianapolis tattoo removed. Bad idea.

The Roaring Twenties? Hardly. The late-20th-century free-love movement? Not even close. The Victorian era is, unquestionably, the sexiest. What’s hotter than anxiety and repression? Or more titillating than the chasm between public and private behavior, between the pedestal-placing of the wife/mother and the enormous rise in prostitution? It’s no coincidence that one of the most erotic characters in literature, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, appeared in 1897, toward the end of Queen Victoria’s reign. (Remember: He had to leave Transylvania and come to England to feast upon pure blood, and open all those untouched . . . necks.) Even the thought of the armorlike clothing of the times coupled with the frilly nothings underneath makes me swoon. There’s a reason the most ubiquitous lingerie shop in America is called Victoria’s Secret and not, say, Richard Nixon’s Secret."
"‘How We Got to Now,’ by Steven Johnson",2014-12-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Steven Johnson explores the ramifications, good and bad, of six technologies that have changed the world.","By the time you reach the end of Steven Johnson’s latest book on innovation, you’re apt to find yourself exhilarated and a little bit fatigued. It’s a case of literary jet lag. You’ve been with Johnson to secret chambers within the pyramids of Giza and foul trenches in the sewers of old Chicago; you’ve looked through telescopes on Mauna Kea and peered into microscopes with 19th-century bacteriologists. You’ve had to move around space and time to do this, but more crucially, you’ve had to wander back and forth through passageways that connect technological history with politics, economics and culture. Have you ever wondered why flash photography led to antipoverty programs at the turn of the 20th century? Or how the invention of the laser contributed to the decline of mom-and-pop stores? Of course you haven’t, because you didn’t really stop to think — wait, check that; I didn’t really stop to think — how the invention of flash photography finally allowed Jacob Riis to capture the images of dismal tenement life on New York’s Lower East Side that he had already been writing about, with little impact, for years. Or how the laser begat the bar code that, in turn, gave an efficiency advantage to stores like Target and Walmart. “How We Got to Now” is full of nifty connections like these — stories that illustrate obscure chains of causality that shaped the modern world. We’ve gone from making cave paintings to using slender slabs of powerful technology like the iPhone 6. But it’s hardly been a linear path. Johnson shows the meandering process by which we’ve made this journey, and what sort of cultural waves ripple outward as we move ahead. "

What’s on TV Saturday,2014-12-27,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014) Wes Anderson summons the spirit of Stefan Zweig, the early-20th-century Viennese writer, in this tale about the mercurial concierge (Ralph Fiennes) of a fictional 1930s European ski resort — his exceptional service includes fulfilling his female guests’ sexual needs. Framed for the murder of an aristocratic lover (Tilda Swinton) who bequeathed him a valuable painting, he conspires with his lobby boy (Tony Revolori) to prove his innocence in exchange for naming him his heir. Tom Wilkinson plays the aging writer who, in 1985, recounts the story in this flashback-in-a-flashback setup. Jude Law is his younger self who, in 1968, learns of the caper from the proprietor (F. Murray Abraham) of the hotel, now a kitschy Iron Curtain vestige of its former glory. With its quintessential Anderson moments — as when inmates escape from prison using tiny implements concealed in frothy pastries — the film “will delight his fans, but even those inclined to grumble that it’s just more of the same patented whimsy might want to look again,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. While Hitler and Stalin don’t exist in Mr. Anderson’s fantasy world, “this movie makes a marvelous mockery of history, turning its horrors into a series of graceful jokes and mischievous gestures. You can call this escapism if you like. You can also think of it as revenge.”"

United Arab Emirates Ban ‘Exodus’ Movie,2014-12-28,article,Brief,,['Movies'],The United Arab Emirates have become the third country to ban Ridley Scott’s $140 million film about the biblical story of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt.,"The United Arab Emirates have become the third country to ban “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” Ridley Scott’s $140 million film about the biblical story of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt. The decision was made because of the film’s “many mistakes not only about Islam but other religions, too,” Juma Obeid Al Leem, director of media content tracking at the National Media Council, told the English-language newspaper The Gulf News. The announcement came on the heels of announcements that the film would not be shown in Morocco and Egypt because of its portrayal of Moses, as well as historical inaccuracies and giving “a Zionist view of history.” “Exodus,” produced by 20th Century Fox, was previously criticized for having white actors in the leading roles — including Christian Bale as Moses — despite being set in Egypt. It has had tepid results at the box office, taking in $52.5 million in domestic ticket sales since opening nationwide on Dec. 12, according to Box Office Mojo. It’s not the first time Arab countries have banned Hollywood films because of religion: Darren Aronofsky’s “Noah” was barred in several countries in the spring, and the animated movie “The Prince of Egypt” was forbidden in Egypt in 1998."
The Set for ‘The Alamo’ Hopes to Live Again as a Theme Park,2014-12-28,article,Brief,,"['ALAMO (SAN ANTONIO, TEX)', 'AMUSEMENT AND THEME PARKS', 'Historic Buildings and Sites', 'Movies']","A businessman in Corpus Christi, Tex., hopes to bring tourists back to Alamo Village.","The Alamo has weathered cannon blasts, Santa Anna’s army and urban growth. But for a replica of that Texas landmark, above, neglect may be the biggest foe. Alamo Village, a 400-acre set built in the late 1950s for John Wayne’s movie  “The Alamo,” is slowly losing the battle against time and nature, The Associated Press reported. More than 100 additional productions, including movies and music videos, were filmed at the site, about 120 miles west of the actual Alamo in downtown San Antonio. The set contained more than 200,000 square feet of permanent buildings, including a church, blacksmith shop and a jail, according to the Texas State Historical Association. For several decades it was a popular tourist destination, drawing hundreds of daily visitors at its height for musical shows and staged gunfights. But attendance waned in the 1980s as traffic shifted north after the completion of Interstate 10, The A.P. reported. The set was put up for sale in 2004 by Virginia Shahan, who took over operations after the death in 1996 of James T. Shahan, her husband and founder of Alamo Village. It was eventually closed in 2010, about a year after Ms. Shahan died. The site is now mostly used for cattle grazing and hunting, and some buildings are beginning to succumb to the elements, The A.P. reported. David Jones, a businessman in Corpus Christi, Tex., hopes to bring tourists back to Alamo Village. He told The A.P. he is close to raising the $8 million he estimates is needed to buy the property and turn it into a Texas version of Old Tucson, a theme park in Arizona."

He also seems to be its inspiration: Since its release, “Super 8” has drawn usually unfavorable comparisons to “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” and especially to “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” “Still,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, "" ‘not as good as E.T.’ is not so bad.” The film, directed by the Spielberg admirer J. J. Abrams, is about a group of young teenagers (including Gabriel Basso, Ryan Lee, Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths) in 1979 who are filming a low-budget zombie movie when they witness a violent train derailment. They can’t see much in the chaos of the crash, but it’s possible that their camera saw more. While they wait for the film to be developed, strange things begin happening in their town. Dogs and people disappear, electronics go missing, and the streets fill with soldiers. Mr. Abrams, Mr. Scott wrote, captures his protagonists and their era “with a sense of period detail that sits right on the line between uncanny and neurotic.” He added: “His 1979 is more like 1979 than the real 1979, which hardly seemed like a time of innocence and eager wonder.
