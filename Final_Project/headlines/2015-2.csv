Read the semi-legible calligraphic names along the coasts and riverbanks, and you begin to perceive that this isn’t really a map of North America nor of New France. It’s a navigation chart and a relic of a time when waterways assumed out-of-scale proportions in our geographies."

Mo Yan’s ‘Frog’,2015-02-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The novelist and Nobel laureate Mo Yan depicts the horrors of China’s one-child policy.,"In October 2012, Mo Yan became the first citizen of mainland China to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Since then, he has been attacked both inside and outside China for his collaboration with the Communist literary establishment: for his vice chairmanship of the state writers’ association, for remarking that censorship falls in the same category as airport security. In the summer of 2012, he controversially hand-copied, for a special commemorative edition, part of the 1942 “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art,” Mao Zedong’s statement of orthodoxy on the arts that became the theoretical ur-text of Chinese socialist realism and literary censorship. Yet readers will find little in “Frog,” Howard Gold­blatt’s fluent translation of Mo Yan’s 2009 novel about his country’s one-child policy, that validates the society created by the Chinese Communist Party. It is an anarchic, brutal book about the inhumanity of servants of the Communist state, the inadequacy of Chinese men and the moral vacuum at the heart of post-Mao China."

The first time I heard this expression, I reveled in the very idea of it. It felt like the perfect life goal for all humankind: a feeling of complete belongingness and freedom, unconstrained by society’s perceptions of your capabilities, wherever you happen to be — at home or in public. The phrase resonates in three new picture books that highlight issues of race, gender and justice. These stories — about Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Susan B. Anthony, and the Loving v. Virginia case that struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage — all have main characters with a steadfast determination to change their lives. They are willing to fight their known hell for an unknown, possibly harsher fate. In each book, the law looms as a character, too, a force that can save lives or kill spirits.

Inside the List,2015-02-06,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Jill Leovy, whose “Ghettoside” is No. 8 on the hardcover nonfiction list, once kept a blog tracking every murder in Los Angeles County.","Equal Weight: Jill Leovy’s “Ghettoside,” a true-crime narrative about a murder case in South Los Angeles that opens into a larger exploration of black-on-black violence, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8. Leovy is a longtime reporter for The Los Angeles Times, where for years she maintained the Homicide Report blog to track every murder in the county, in an effort to “communicate the horror of it,” as she said on NPR’s “Fresh Air” recently. “I don’t like blogs very much,” she told the host Dave Davies. “You can scan a newspaper front page and get an idea of what you need to be thinking about very quickly. A blog is just a stack, an undifferentiated stack of news. You can’t tell the trivial from the weighty. And so it doesn’t work for a lot of things — but it occurred to me that it would work for this, that the form would suit what I was trying to say exactly, which is to give everything equal weight. . . . This is not a new story about the sensational case, about the case getting attention. This is just all of them stacked up in a row so that the reader can peruse them and get an idea of who’s dying.”"

"‘Founders’ Son: A Life of Abraham Lincoln,’ by Richard Brookhiser",2015-02-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Richard Brookhiser casts Lincoln as what might today be called an originalist, a leader who acted in accordance with the founders’ intentions.","In 2012, Ford’s Theater, the site of Lincoln’s assassination, erected an unusual tribute to the 16th president: a 34-foot tower, eight feet around, created from some 7,000 of the more than 15,000 books about Lincoln that have been published since his death. Richard Brookhiser, the award-winning author of biographies of the founding fathers, now adds to that list, venturing past the Revolution into a new era to explore the life of this most written-about American. In many ways, however, this is less a book in which Brookhiser moves forward in time than one that endeavors to pull Lincoln back into the 18th century, claiming him, in the title’s words, as fundamentally the “founders’ son.” Brookhiser casts Lincoln as what might today be called an originalist, a leader who applied the doctrines of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution in accordance with the founders’ intentions in order to chart his way through a new national crisis."

"‘X,’ a Novel About Malcolm X",2015-02-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A young-adult novel based on the black leader’s early years, co‑written by one of his daughters.","It would be fascinating to get Malcolm X’s take on the current surge of racial tension in America. At first glance, we seem to have made great strides toward equality since the civil rights movement. We elected Barack Obama, a black man, president. Twice. We almost universally condemn outright racism. But is it possible that racism (most notably against African-­Americans) hasn’t receded so much as it has evolved and become more refined? “The elegant racist,” Ta-Nehisi Coates has written, “knows how to injure nonwhite people while never summoning the specter of white guilt.” Housing segregation, for instance, is both devastating and hard to detect. And according to the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for prison reform, racial minorities are more likely than whites to be arrested, to be convicted and to face stiff sentences. With recent racially charged events like the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York City — as well as the rising plea for more representation of minorities in children’s literature from the We Need Diverse Books movement — I can’t think of a more appropriate time for a book about the early years of Malcolm X."

In Willhelm’s hands, geometric cuts and experimental textiles explore not utility, but the sometimes messy rules of attraction — and he’s quick to cite the adage that we put on clothes hoping someone else will take them off later. “I think if you have sex with somebody it’s very, very important that you have a little laugh together,” says Willhelm, noting that he was the first cover boy for the magazine Butt. “When sex gets too serious it’s unbearable, and that’s the same with sexy fashion.” This good-humored dedication to liberation is on full display in Willhelm’s exhibition “When Fashion Shows the Danger Then Fashion Is the Danger,” co-conceived with his longtime collaborator Jutta Kraus, and opening this weekend at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles."

Other ships in the vicinity hurried to the scene and rescued all but one of the seventy-seven members of the crew.

Fifty-four members of the 100-man crew of the 875-ton British minesweeper Sphinx were lost when it foundered yesterday as it was being towed to port, after having been attacked by German planes.

‘Wolsey Angels’ to Go to the V&A Museum,2015-02-08,article,Brief,,"['Art', 'Sculpture']",The Victoria and Albert Museum surpassed its goal of raising 2.5 million pounds ($3.8 million) to purchase the four statues.,"The Victoria and Albert Museum surpassed its goal on Sunday of raising 2.5 million pounds ($3.8 million) to purchase four statues created by the Italian sculptor Benedetto da Rovezzano for the tomb of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, an adviser to Henry VIII and once one of England’s most powerful men. The statues, known as the Wolsey Angels, were commissioned in 1524, just before the cardinal lost his power after failing to convince the pope to annul the king’s marriage. The cardinal appeared in Hilary Mantel’s novel “Wolf Hall.” Ms. Mantel said in a statement that the recovery of the angels “is one of those miracles that historians pray for; something that seems irrevocably lost has been there all the time.” After Wolsey’s death in 1530, Henry VIII acquired the statues for his own tomb, which was never completed. They were eventually sold during the 1640s to raise money during England’s Civil War and were unheard of again until two surfaced at an auction in 1994. The other pair was discovered in 2008 at a country house in Northamptonshire in central England. The majority of the funds for the purchase came from a two-million pound grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, while another 500,000 pounds came from the Art Fund, a charity that helps British museums purchase art. Additional funds came from donations and museum supporters — including 33,000 pounds from on-site donations and one-pound “Save the Wolsey Angels” badges. The statutes are on display at the museum but will be temporarily removed to undergo conservation treatment."

What’s On TV Monday,2015-02-09,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"7:15 P.M. (HBO Signature) BELLE (2014) The biracial daughter (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) of a British Navy captain (Matthew Goode) struggles to transcend life as a black woman in slave-trading England after being raised in privilege by her aristocratic uncle and aunt (Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson), and alongside her white cousin (Sarah Gadon, above right, with Ms. Mbatha-Raw), in this biopic about the historical figure Dido Elizabeth Belle (1761-1804). Directed by Amma Asante and written by Misan Sagay, the film chronicles the challenging love life of Belle, an educated beauty — including a dashing suitor, John Davinier (Sam Reid), as well as several not-so-charming ones. The movie also covers Belle’s uncle, the lord chief justice who must decide on a case involving a Zong slave ship on which more than 130 Africans were massacred for an insurance payment. “The movie plays with the historical record for dramatic effect, as is often the case when the past is disinterred for entertainment, and its realism at times groans under the weight of too many passionate speeches,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Yet the weave of the personal and the political finally proves as irresistible as it is moving, partly because it has been drawn from extraordinary life.”"

Jackson, a former Marine and Iraq veteran, writes that what the movie “American Sniper” gets right — or wrong –depends on who’s watching. But he thinks the film could play an important role in reminding both veterans and civilians of how unresolved the war’s recent history is.","This week, the trial of the man accused of killing Chris Kyle opens in a Texas courtroom, even as the Clint Eastwood film based on Mr. Kyle’s life, “American Sniper,” is playing in a theater three miles away. Much as Mr. Kyle’s death shocked the nation, the film has generated fierce debate nationally over the meaning of his life and his death, and the Iraq war itself. To some, Mr. Kyle represents all that was right with the American-led invasion, to others, all that was wrong. Yet to many veterans, his story offers a chance to discuss and debate a remarkable array of complex and personal questions: the mix of motivations that lead people to sign up in the military, the riot of emotions troops feel when they kill or witness death, the struggle to reengage with civilian society upon coming home. A number of people have sent At War essays about how they viewed the film, including the piece below by a former Marine. What do you think? Send us your thoughts: atwar@nytimes.com."

The references to slavery and segregation inspired debates about how deeply religion was implicated in those institutions (the short answer: a lot more deeply than many Christian conservatives care to admit today, though not in exactly the same way that religion is implicated in the crimes of ISIS; the South was many things, including a home to terrorism, but it was not a utopian theocracy); the reference to the Inquisition inspired some discussion of just how bad the institution really was (the answer: not as bad as Black Legend-style history would have it, but at its worst quite, quite bad enough). But only the Crusades inspired a debate about whether they deserve to be condemned at all."

Midcentury Modernism Arrives in the California Desert,2015-02-11,article,News,,[],The auction site Paddle8 has partnered with the design firm Homepolish to create a pop-up series of interiors vignettes at the Ace Hotel and Swim Club.,"In the coming days, design and art lovers will descend on the desert east of Los Angeles for the 10th edition of Palm Springs Modernism Week. Among the lectures, house tours, exhibitions and fairs this year, one unofficial event stands out — and even offers the chance for the snowbound to get in on the action. The auction site Paddle8 has partnered with the design firm Homepolish to create “Desert Living: Icons of Modern Design,” a pop-up series of interiors vignettes at the Ace Hotel and Swim Club’s 4,000-square-foot clubhouse space.

One California-themed tableau includes Frank Gehry’s cardboard chair, Bill Curry’s “Cattail” lamp, John Baldessari prints and an Ed Ruscha painting; another explores the notion of opulence through such pieces as a chrome 1970s Gucci wine cooler and a Helmut Newton nude photograph. And a future-themed area features Gerald McCabe’s seven-stemmed “Daisy” table and artwork by Kenny Scharf, Sam Francis and David Hockney. The environments will be accessible to visitors this weekend and are, Stein promises, “really layered”; for those stuck in less salubrious climes, everything is up for auction starting Wednesday on the Paddle8 site."

As it turns out, achieving this no-makeup makeup effect (seen on many a runway — and surely many more in the weeks to come during the fall/winter 2015 fashion shows), requires the right mix of products (11 to be exact) and ample blending. Here, McGrath reveals the secrets behind her stealth technique that results in casual perfection."

What’s on TV Wednesday,2015-02-11,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"7 P.M. (Reelz) INVICTUS (2009) This rousing drama from Clint Eastwood, based on the book “Playing the Enemy” by John Carlin, was inspired by a true story of reconciliation and athletic triumph. Morgan Freeman portrays Nelson Mandela, newly elected as South Africa’s first black president, and Matt Damon is François Pienaar, the captain of the Springbok rugby team, a source of Afrikaner pride despised by many blacks. Mandela views the team as a vehicle to bring the country’s races together, especially if it can win the Rugby World Cup tournament in 1995, which South Africa is to host. “ ‘Invictus’ has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It’s an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership.” In “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom” (2013), Justin Chadwick’s biopic, at 6:35 on Showtime, Idris Elba portrays Mandela and Naomie Harris is his wife, Winnie. “Mr. Elba’s towering performance lends ‘Long Walk to Freedom’ a Shakespearean breadth,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. “His Mandela is an intensely emotional man whose body quakes in moments of sorrow and whose face is stricken with a bone-deep anguish. The carefully chosen words in his eloquent declarations of principle, spoken with gravity and deliberation, are deeply stirring.”"

The Republican-controlled Senate voted down the measure. Unauthorized immigrants can receive driver’s licenses in 10 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Colorado’s program began in 2014, and state motor vehicle offices issuing these license have been swamped with requests from immigrants. But critics maintain that the program rewards people who have crossed into the country without authorization. Last month, the state’s joint budget committee voted not to approve about $166,000 in new funds for the program, forcing officials to lay off workers and stop issuing the licenses at four of the five participating motor vehicle offices. One office, in Denver, was left to process the licenses. "

Inside the List,2015-02-13,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Nick Hornby, whose novel “Funny Girl” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 9, has lately embraced Hollywood in a big way.","Adaptation, Part I: Readers who have kept tabs on Nick Hornby’s career might not be surprised that his new novel, “Funny Girl” — new at No. 9 on the hardcover fiction list — devotes considerable attention to a couple of scriptwriters. That’s because Hornby, who made his name with the 1995 novel “High Fidelity,” has lately embraced Hollywood in a big way. He received an Oscar nomination for his screenplay for the 2009 movie “An Education” (adapted from Lynn Barber’s memoir), then went on to adapt Cheryl Strayed’s “Wild,” currently in theaters, and Colm Toibin’s novel “Brooklyn,” which had its premiere last month at Sundance. (Interestingly, Hornby did not write the screenplay for “High Fidelity,” which jumped to film in 2000, or any of his other books to become movies — confirming the wisdom that it’s better to operate on other people’s children than your own.) In a recent online interview with The Atlantic, Hornby, who is British, explained why he had actively pursued the “Wild” gig: “There’s a side of me that responds very deeply to American things,” he said. “The book to me felt like a Springsteen album. I always loved Springsteen, but he’s very American. That kind of directness is really interesting to me because it doesn’t have to be unsubtle. It’s just a different way of being, a different way of thinking. The great thing about adaptation is it gives you a chance to be someone else.”"

1915: Britain Hails Air Raid’s Success,2015-02-13,article,News,,"['Military Aircraft', 'World War I (1914-18)']",Highlights from the International Herald Tribune archives: Largest British air raid to date is incredibly successful in 1915.,"LONDON — All England is rejoicing to-day [Feb. 13] at the superb flight of her great air fleet, thirty-four strong, across the Channel, with not a serious injury to a pilot, and accidents to only two of the machines. It seems almost incredible that it was only five years ago that Blériot made the pioneer aeroplane trip across the Channel, so vast and rapid has been the progress since. The raid not only represents the largest fleet of air craft that has ever operated together, but it is a fitting reply to the German bombardment of British towns, and a warning to the Kaiser’s forces in Belgium of further damage. One fact well demonstrated by the raid is that in case of such an attack, land guns are unreliable defences, and it is necessary to meet aeroplanes with aeroplanes. The attack probably puts an end to Germany’s reputed intention to use Zeebrugge and other places on the Belgian coast as bases for submarines. The Admiralty states that no submarines were seen. This indicates that German preparations are too incomplete for them to trust these craft in Belgian harbors. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Feb. 14, 1915"

The big foreign policy piece that everyone is talking about this week, and deservedly, is Graeme Wood’s deep Atlantic dive into the religious premises underpinning the Islamic State’s vision and grand strategy. Wood’s argument is rich enough to defy easy summary, but his core point is that Western analysts tend to understate not only the essential religiosity of ISIS’s worldview, but the extent to which that worldview has substantial theological grounding. It isn’t just a few guys making up a cult out of random bits of scripture; its political-religious vision appeals precisely because it derives “from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.” And we ignore the coherence of those interpretations at our peril: The Islamic State’s “intellectual genealogy” is intensely relevant to its political strategy, and its theology “must be understood to be combatted.”"

These days, retailers like Target unknowingly shill imitations of her work. Now that every twentysomething in Brooklyn (and their mothers elsewhere) own the little glass spheres that contain living plants, succulents and crystals, Hayes has moved on. “I’m contemplating in the realm of nature, but it has moved into sculptural form and illumination,” the 57-year-old says.

Standing on a stage lit by gleaming chandeliers before an audience of Russia’s elite celebrities, the parodist Elena Vorobei sings to the tune of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive,” in a crude impersonation of Conchita Wurst, the Austrian drag queen who won the 2014 Eurovision song contest. Vorobei is dressed in a sparkling gown, winking cheekily, scratching at her bearded face and swishing her lustrous wig around. “I have a beard!” she belts. At one point she throws out a Hitler salute, a gesture that’s meant to evoke Austria, Conchita’s homeland. The camera pans the laughing audience, cutting for a moment to a well-known actor-singer-writer-bodybuilder and then to one of the show’s M.C.s, Russia’s pop king, the also-bearded Philipp Kirkorov (widely assumed to be gay). The men, who are almost all tanned, in sharply cut suits, grin with unconstrained glee. The bejeweled women wear tight, knowing smiles. Everyone sways and claps."

It had been more than two months since protesters first sat on that street in their raincoats, sleepless and worried that the military would soon arrive. The fear had now dissipated, and on this cool December evening, the atmosphere was raucous and festive. People filled the empty spaces between tents, spilling out of a metro stop and pouring over concrete barriers with the help of carefully constructed wooden steps. They lined up for free souvenirs — silk-screened T-shirts, leather necklaces, protest stickers — and gathered around microphones for open meetings. They threw glitter and snapped photographs. They sang along to pop songs crooned by a man called Bananaooyoo (now a protest icon whose signature color, like that of the protest itself, is yellow). Archivists removed pieces of artwork for safekeeping, and a few activists hung yellow banners: “We’ll be back.”"

Yoppy is young and friendly and lives in a small apartment in the Shinagawa neighborhood of Tokyo. His full name is Yuhsuke Yoshimoto, but at least with visitors who come to stay with him through his listing on Airbnb, he prefers to go by Yoppy. He wears heavy-framed black glasses, has a boyish haircut and likes to talk to foreigners, even though his English is admittedly poor. In the one photo I’ve seen of him — his profile shot on Airbnb — he’s wearing a navy blazer, a collared shirt and a thin silver necklace. He smiles at the camera in a pleasant but not overbearing way. It would be hard, I imagine, not to like Yoppy if you were to meet him at a dinner party or at a gathering of pharmacists or financial planners (according to his profile, Yoppy is both a pharmacist and a financial planner), but still that says little about how you would feel when putting your toothbrush on the sink next to his late at night in a city that’s far, far from home."

These photos, as well as the portraits of national leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, are explicit about the subject at hand. They tell us what is happening and make a case for why things must change.

"My Dear, Dear, Dear Watson",2015-02-19,article,News,,"['Television', 'Computers and the Internet', 'Dating and Relationships']","The weird, wonderful world of “shipping,” or imagining romances between fictional characters.","Part of the Internet’s beauty is the space it affords people to take an idea and run with it . . . and run with it and run with it, until they end up miles away from where they started. Among a subset of online superfans of the BBC show “Sherlock,” solving mysteries is mere window dressing for the real story: one about unrequited love between Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman). This sort of wholesale invention, by viewers, of a romance between fictional characters who are not romantically linked on-screen is a form of something known as “shipping” (short for “relationship-ing,” the term can also refer to rooting for actual fictional couples). It is by no means limited to “Sherlock” — any form of pop culture, from “Scandal” to One Direction, is fair game — but that show has inspired vast and vivid fictional worlds, completely imagined by shippers who share screenshots, drawings and even entire books speculating about what a dalliance between Sherlock and Watson (or Johnlock, as it’s known) might look like. These fans wring meaning out of every lingering glance and anguished expression that crosses Cumberbatch’s impressively dimensioned face and superimpose their own dialogue atop these moments, amassing a trove of erotic imaginings that is in some respects more compelling than the canon, at least in the unpredictability of the plot twists. For example, one offshoot of Johnlock, known as Fawnlock, imagines Cumberbatch as an ethereal deer, complete with graceful antlers and a speckled coat — and of course his lover, Watson, cradled in his forelimbs."

(CBS) THE ODD COUPLE Matthew Perry stars as Oscar Madison, a slovenly sports radio host, and Thomas Lennon is Felix Unger, an avowed neat freak, in this remake of the ’70s Jack Klugman-Tony Randall sitcom about roommates struggling to survive their divorces. Wendell Pierce plays Oscar’s agent; Leslie Bibb lives in their building and is willing to date Oscar, but only for sex; and Lauren Graham is his ex-wife. “The new show updates the surface details without dissolving the central bond between the two friends,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “This is Mr. Perry’s third attempt at sitcom success after a decade on ‘Friends,’ and there is an uneasiness to his performance — in some scenes he looks startled, even frightened — that makes it hard to play off Mr. Lennon, who seems very comfortable as a nervous nelly. That chemistry could come with time, but even if the show flops, it’s an interesting experiment.” In “The Big Bang Theory,” leading in at 8, Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) gets some startling news as the gang prepares to help Stuart (Kevin Sussman) celebrate the reopening of his comic book store. And in the finale of “Two and a Half Men,” at 9, rumor has it that Charlie Harper, the character played by Charlie Sheen, may still be alive."

Last month, the artist received a 2014 U.S. State Department Medal of Arts; and this week, he prepares for his first museum retrospective, “A New Republic,” which will open at the Brooklyn Museum on Friday. Throughout his career, Wiley’s pieces have canonized the people they portray: Descendants from Africa, Haiti, Jamaica and elsewhere, depicted along with emblems of culture and identity. “My work, for a long time, has focused on the ideals that we celebrate in America and abroad,” he says. Many of his paintings outsource their influence from popular movements that predate the 19th century, like Flemish portraiture from the Northern Renaissance. But instead of using dark colors to create a sense of severity or authority, Wiley’s portraits explode with energy and color — particularly in their use of clothing, which occupies a central role in his work. “Fashion is fragile and fleeting,” he notes. “But it is also an indicator for the cultural and social appetites for a nation.”"

Lucy Skaer: ‘Sticks & Stones’ and ‘Random House’,2015-02-19,article,Review,,['Art'],"In two shows, the excellent British artist Lucy Skaer covers much ground in several mediums with uneven results.","In two shows, the excellent British artist Lucy Skaer covers much ground in several mediums with uneven results. The repurposing and recycling of objects, images and forms — from other art, her own work, her life — are prominent in Ms. Skaer’s work, as with many artists today. The strategy yields outstanding results in the five related sculptures at Murray Guy. The tone is set by a low-lying sculpture: two thick, rough-edged slices of mahogany inlaid with smaller objects found around her studio — a tiny prototype, parts of other sculptures, a small lithography stone and an oblong blue ceramic tile. The piece, which evokes sculptures by Carl Andre and Bruce Nauman, is itself a prototype for the next four: an all-ceramic version; one in marble with touches of malachite; another in aluminum with gunmetal; and, finally, an all-wood version (including veneer). Together they form a stunning meditation on processes, materials and craft, on mutating details and textural contrasts, on looking, achieving an almost cosmic scope. I doubt each would seem quite so rich on its own."

Inside the List,2015-02-20,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],The protagonist of David Duchovny’s debut novel is a talking cow who sets out for India.,"Out There: From 1993 to 2002, David Duchovny starred in “The X-Files” as the persistent and slightly paranoid F.B.I. special agent Fox Mulder, investigator of and true believer in paranormal activity. Then, from 2007 to 2014, he took on the even scarier role of Hank Moody, the wild-boy writer in “Californication” — surely the most debauched novelist to appear on television since Angela Lansbury’s Jessica Fletcher in “Murder, She Wrote.” But Lansbury never produced a novel of her own. Duchovny has done just that, and the book — “Holy Cow,” his debut — enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 16. It’s not necessarily the novel you’d expect from the man who played Hank Moody. The protagonist, Elsie Bovary, is a talking cow who sets out for India after she learns that cattle there are viewed as more than hamburger meat; along the way she’s joined by a pig determined to reach Israel (where pork is off the menu) and a turkey bound for Turkey (“That was really just a play on words,” Duchovny told the trade magazine Kirkus Reviews). But beneath the goofy plot, which The Huffington Post described, not wholly favorably, as “a mash-up between ‘Animal Farm’ and ‘Chicken Run,’ ” Duchovny is thinking seriously about environmentalism and animal rights. “It’s an attitude of brotherhood,” he told Kirkus, “not only with other human beings, but with all the animals on the planet. I think it’s because of climate change that everyone is coming around to the idea that this is the finite planet and there’s a lot of unnecessary pain and overconsumption on it and there are things around us that have feelings that we don’t normally ascribe to having feelings. I don’t think rocks have feelings; I draw the line there.”"

What’s on TV Monday,2015-02-23,article,News,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) CITIZENFOUR (2014) Laura Poitras had been working on a film about surveillance for two years when Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency whistle-blower, contacted her in January 2013, using the name “Citizenfour.” When Mr. Snowden let Ms. Poitras know that he would not conceal his identity as the source of information about N.S.A. surveillance, she persuaded him to let her film their encounter. This Oscar-nominated documentary chronicles the encounter in a Hong Kong hotel room of Ms. Poitras; Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who first wrote about Mr. Snowden’s revelations; and Mr. Snowden as he hands over classified documents that provide evidence of the N.S.A.’s invasion of privacy and copes with the resulting media storm. “Cinema, even in the service of journalism, is always more than reporting, and focusing on what Ms. Poitras’s film is about risks ignoring what it is,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It’s a tense and frightening thriller that blends the brisk globe-trotting of the ‘Bourne’ movies with the spooky, atmospheric effects of a Japanese horror film. And it is also a primal political fable for the digital age, a real-time tableau of the confrontation between the individual and the state.” He added: “Thinking about the issues Ms. Poitras raises can induce a kind of epistemological vertigo. What do we know about what is known about us? Who knows it? Can we trust them? These questions are terrifying, and so is ‘Citizenfour.’ ”"

Draped horizontally on a plinth with fingers pinched in a Cleopatran gesture, Huxtable was originally meant to be immortalized in one of her signature looks before Benson, apprehensively, asked her to pose nude. “I was nervous of what she might think of that,” he says, “so I sent her this intense email full of historical references.” And though she is without clothing, her personal style is retained in the braids Benson painstakingly drew in a digital drafting program and the green makeup spray-painted onto the statue’s skin. The artwork stands as a token of how virtuosity and virtuality come together in the digital age. “I want the sculpture to exist as a completely finished entity inside the computer,” Benson says. “The 3D model is its ultimate version and the print is the real-world manifestation of it.”"

Bear Extraordinaire,2015-02-25,article,Review,,[],A picture book tells the story of the real bear who inspired A. A. Milne’s Winnie-the-Pooh.,"In the annals of human-animal comradeship, there is nothing quite like the tale of a brown bear cub named Winnipeg, Winnie for short, the inspiration behind A. A. Milne’s “Winnie-the-Pooh.” She was bought for $20 by a Canadian soldier at the outset of World War I, sailed with him to England, then ended up living out her years at the London Zoo. There, a little boy named Christopher Robin took a shine to her, renaming his own stuffed bear Winnie and prompting his father to write the classic children’s books. As a new picture book by Sally M. Walker plays it, this is a “gee-whiz” kind of story, with one improbable, satisfying moment after another and little to no conflict. Jonathan D. Voss’s sweetly realistic, nostalgic watercolor illustrations go down easy as well, casting a benign glow even over scenes of army life during wartime. The little brown bear is adorable and affectionate, winning the heart of every human she comes into contact with, and her owner, Harry Colebourn, is a paragon of kind, virtuous, never-say-never manhood. Though Winnie earned her place in history accidentally, Walker’s storybook narration makes her legendary status seem well deserved, even preordained."

This has left me a little shy of talking about allegory, and very shy of ever mentioning “The Pilgrim’s Progress.”"

At the time, American companies and governments still bought insurance from the old British firms, and the payouts to San Francisco were enormous.

In response, so many wealthy Americans sent money to England that, a few months after the gold came west from London, $30 million in U.S. gold traveled east.

The Closed Minds Problem,2015-02-27,article,News,,[],How do you deal with Rick Santelli and Allan Meltzer?,"When I was a young economist trying to build a career, I lived — or thought I lived — in a world in which ideas and those who championed them met in relatively open intellectual combat. Of course there were people who clung to their prejudices, of course style sometimes trumped substance. But I believed that by and large better ideas tended to prevail: if your model of trade flows or exchange rate fluctuations tracked the data better than someone else’s, or resolved puzzles that other models couldn’t, you could expect it to be taken up by many if not most researchers in the field."

Transcending War,2015-02-27,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Elliot Ackerman’s debut novel, “Green on Blue,” was partly inspired by his experience training Afghan soldiers.","The novelist Elliot Ackerman studied literature in his undergraduate days at Tufts University, but becoming a Marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan delayed his own literary career. “I knew I wanted to write but took an eight-year detour in the wars,” Ackerman said in an email interview. “While fighting, I couldn’t find the creative space to craft a novel or story; the emotions and material I was dealing with were too raw.”"
Elliot Ackerman’s ‘Green on Blue’,2015-02-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A young soldier from Afghanistan narrates this first novel by an American who served several tours of duty there.,"In 1971, with the war in Vietnam ferociously stalemated, David Halberstam published a biography of North Vietnam’s leader, Ho Chi Minh, who had died two years earlier. Books about the enemy are typical in times of war. What was atypical about “Ho” was its fawning tone: “In his lifetime,” Halberstam wrote, “Ho had not only liberated his own country . . . he had touched the culture and soul of his enemy.” It’s a pretty lousy biography by any measure, every page a basket of freshly picked cherries, but for many historians on the right it’s still viewed as traitorous rot — as if Ernie Pyle had written, in 1943, “Goebbels: A Celebration.”"

"‘The Big Seven,’ by Jim Harrison",2015-02-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"An outlaw clan terrorizes a town in the Upper Peninsula, and Jim Harrison’s hapless detective is caught in the crossfire.","A startling moment occurs in Jim Harrison’s 2011 novel, “The Great Leader,” when the protagonist, Detective Sunderson, abruptly reflects on an incident that has landed him in the hospital. His soon-to-be ex-wife, Diane, has left with all of her things, and Sunderson drinks a bottle of Canadian whisky. “This had gone on a couple of days and . . . a colleague had checked up and found him facedown and comatose on the floor of the unheated enclosed back porch after a 10-degree night.” Up until this point, Sunderson’s steady drinking has been recklessly celebratory in this whisky-soaked novel, the kind of soaking one expects from a divorced detective at the outset of his retirement. But when he blithely reveals that he spent a few days unconscious, all the previous pages are cast into a foggy doubt. Just how screwed up is this guy, and exactly how stewed has he been for the past several chapters?"
"‘The Italians,’ by John Hooper",2015-02-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The Economist’s Italy correspondent explains the confounding inner workings of the Bel Paese.,"One of the epigraphs John Hooper uses to introduce the various chapters in his new book, “The Italians,” is a bit of dialogue from the 1949 film “The Third Man.” In it, Harry Lime compares the tumultuous 30 years of Borgia rule in Italy, which produced the Renaissance and some of its greatest artists, to the 500 years of democracy and peace in Switzerland, which, he claims, produced only the cuckoo clock."
Jorie Graham’s ‘From the New World’,2015-02-27,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets']",Jorie Graham’s career-spanning selected poems show how she moved the art form forward.,"Writing about Jorie Graham at this point, seven books after she won the Pulitzer Prize for “The Dream of the Unified Field: Selected Poems 1974-1994,” means joining a cacophony of voices. Google her name and you will find her elders, her peers and those she has influenced (and she has influenced most poets younger than she is, and not just in English, whether they know it or not) making cases for and against the importance of her work. People have all sorts of reasons to love or hate her, and even love to hate her for reasons they sometimes can’t articulate. The most evident case for Graham’s importance is the volume of chatter eddying around her name. Tune all of that out and the deeper reasons for her lasting reputation grow louder. Graham’s great body of work, summarized in “From the New World,” her new career-spanning selected poems (one can understand why active poets resist the tombstone of a “collected” volume), has so much in it, more of life and of the world than that of almost any other poet now writing. Or so it seems to me — as anxious, I realize, as everyone else to make my case."
Daniel Handler’s ‘We Are Pirates’,2015-02-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A father and daughter pursue riches in the music world and on the open water in Daniel Handler’s comic novel.,"“Don’t start with Gwen,” begins the second chapter of Daniel Handler’s new novel, “We Are Pirates.” “Don’t start” means “Don’t begin” but also “Don’t mess with,” because the Gwen in question is a furious 14-year-old girl who has just been caught shoplifting. Her mother has “ransacked” her room and “thrown all her stuff out, thinking it was stolen. Well, it was stolen now.” Gwen, you see, is ­upset, so don’t start with Gwen — the joke being, of course, that Chapter 2 is starting with her. The novel itself starts with the report of how the novel’s narrator meets Gwen’s father: "

But Madeleine’s ambitions would scandalize the neighbors, so it’s kept very hush-hush when she visits the local hospital to help him examine the abused body of 17-year-old Cecile Montaine, who went missing after leaving her convent school."
Irvine Welsh’s ‘The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins’,2015-02-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Irvine Welsh’s tale of abduction and mutual obsession.,"Put down the novel and back away from the doughnuts. It is not advisable to read Irvine Welsh’s 13th book, “The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins,” and snack simultaneously. Because Welsh, known for his gleeful depictions of the depraved degenerates who populate Scotland’s seediest hollows, has turned his attention to one of his adopted homes, Miami Beach, that “sun-drenched refuge for strutting grotesques and desperate narcissists.” This is not Welsh’s first Rollerblade around Florida; “Crime” followed a coke-addled Edinburgh detective along the same bright sidewalks. It is, however, his first to be narrated by two Americans. And not just any two Americans. Female ones. This is a man who once successfully narrated a portion of a novel from the point of view of a tapeworm. The question is, in assuming the perspectives of women, has he bitten off more than he can chew?"
"‘After Birth,’ by Elisa Albert",2015-02-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A novel traces the changes brought by a baby’s arrival.,"“A baby opens you up, is the problem,” explains Ari, who feels she didn’t actually give birth to her 1-year-old son because he was delivered via cesarean section. “There’s before, and there’s after,” she observes. “To live in your body before is one thing. To live in your body after is another.” Which might be the simplest way to communicate the impact of Elisa Albert’s brilliant new novel. “After Birth” cuts open the body of literature on mothering, birth, feminism, female friendship, female hateship — whether academic treatise or poem or novel — and wrenches out something so new we barely recognize it. Wet, red, slimy, alive: a truth baby."

She grew up in a series of foster and group homes, feeling perpetually unwanted."
"‘Hell and Good Company,’ by Richard Rhodes",2015-02-27,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Spanish Civil War (1936-39)']",Richard Rhodes offers an anecdotal — and technological — history of the Spanish Civil War.,"Is it possible to speak intelligently about supremely ideological political events from a standpoint that airily dismisses the supremely ideological politics? Richard Rhodes has put this question to a test by writing an aggressively anti-ideological history of one of the most extravagantly ideological events that has ever occurred, the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. The Spanish war broke out because, on one side, the radically leftist Socialist Party pushed the Republican government ever further to the left, and large parts of the labor movement pushed still more sharply leftward, unto the zones of collectivist and libertarian revolution — and because, on the ­opposite side, the national army and most of the Catholic Church and other parts of society veered sharply rightward, unto the nether regions of the fascist extreme. And, well, the two sides could not get along. Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin made their own specialized contributions. Three years of this and Generalissimo Francisco Franco became the caudillo of Spain, and wartime atrocities gave way to peacetime atrocities."

Inside the List,2015-02-27,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Helen Macdonald, whose memoir “H Is for Hawk” is No. 8 on the hardcover nonfiction list, has become something of a sensation in her native England.","A Massive Wobble: “H Is for Hawk,” Helen Macdonald’s moving memoir about falconry and her father’s death, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8. Macdonald is hardly the first best-selling memoirist to combine nature and grief: In 2012, Roger Rosenblatt spent a couple of weeks on the extended list with the elegiac “Kayak Morning,” in which he paddles around a Long Island creek and reflects on the death of his 38-year-old daughter, while Cheryl Strayed’s “Wild,” about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail after her mother died, has logged more than two and a half years on the hardcover and paperback lists. (It’s currently No. 3 in paperback, after 100 weeks.) Still, Macdonald was unprepared for the kind of success her book has achieved — particularly in her native England, where it was published last year and has become something of a sensation. “It’s freaking me out a bit!” she told The Belfast Telegraph recently. “There was a moment about two weeks ago when I went to do a book talk. People were queuing up to get books signed, and some were incredibly nervous and had shaking hands. I was horrified! They didn’t see me as a person — they saw me as a place holder for being a ‘writer’ or ‘author’ or some figure that wasn’t really me. That threw me into a massive wobble!” Her experience, she said, “taught me that this relationship with what is technically very much a wild animal is a way of getting in touch with all sorts of elemental things. . . . I was in a really dark place, and the hawk helped me through it.”"

What’s on TV Saturday,2015-02-28,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TCM) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Craig Sheffer portrays the writer Norman Maclean as a quiet young man and Brad Pitt is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother, in this adaptation of Mr. Maclean’s 1976 autobiographical story about the sons of a Presbyterian minister coming of age in Montana between Prohibition and the Great Depression — and finding expression for their emotions through fly-fishing. “These are men for whom the physical is inseparably entwined with the spiritual, men for whom both aspects of life are best appreciated knee-deep in a rushing river on a glorious day,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times about this visually stunning film, for which Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for best cinematography. “Between the novella’s well-known first sentence (‘In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing’) and its elegiac last line (‘I am haunted by waters’), ‘A River Runs Through It’ circled gracefully among the landmarks of Mr. Maclean’s early years without violating the distant perfection of those memories.” She added: “It’s easy to recognize Robert Redford’s reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love. While the film is more lavish than Mr. Maclean’s story, and hence less commandingly precise, it radiates much the same seriousness of purpose. The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean — of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace — are ably reflected on the screen.” The evening’s lineup, part of TCM’s “31 Days of Oscar,” continues with “A Few Good Men” (1992), at 10:30; “The English Patient” (1996), at 1 a.m.; and “The Fisher King” (1991), at 4."
