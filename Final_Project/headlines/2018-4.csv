Can Doctors Choose Between Saving Lives and Saving a Fortune?,2018-04-03,article,News,,"['Health Insurance and Managed Care', 'Medicine and Health', 'Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)']",Physicians grapple with the extraordinary cost of medical care in America.,"To understand something about the spiraling cost of health care in the United States, we might begin with a typical conundrum: Imagine a 60-something man — a nonsmoker, overweight, with diabetes — who has just survived a heart attack. Perhaps he had an angioplasty, with the placement of a stent, to open his arteries. The doctor’s job is to keep the vessels open. She has two choices of medicines to reduce the risk for a second heart attack. There’s Plavix, a tried-and-tested blood thinner, that prevents clot formation; the generic version of the drug costs as little as 25 cents a pill. And there’s Brilinta, a newer medicine that is also effective in clot prevention; it costs about $6.50 a pill — 25 times as much."

THE BLACK BEAR INSIDE ME By Robin Becker. (Pittsburgh, paper, $15.95.) These lilting, observational poems often invoke music: ballroom dancing, a Beethoven quartet, Scottish songs. One, “Reading Music,” concludes, “I remember when at five the marks on / the page became a story.” CENZONTLE By Marcelo Hernandez Castillo. (BOA Editions, paper, $16.) The title of Castillo’s debut means “mockingbird,” and birds flit in and out of these poems, singing our world back at us. Castillo embraces an expansive ambiguity — of language, of gender, of nationality — that can sound celebratory and mournful at once. EYE LEVEL By Jenny Xie. (Graywolf, paper, $16.) “Funny, the way we come to understand a place by wanting to escape it,” Xie writes, and the poems in her crystalline debut (with titles including “Rootless,” “Borderless,” “Displacement”) are ever alert to the complex relationship between geography and the self. IS THAT THE SOUND OF A PIANO COMING FROM SEVERAL HOUSES DOWN? By Noah Eli Gordon. (Solid Objects, $20.)

Letter of Recommendation: ‘House Hunters’,2018-04-03,article,News,,"['Television', 'Real Estate and Housing (Residential)']",A dystopian show that will make you feel better about your own life.,"I cannot watch “Black Mirror” anymore.

So nowadays, when the kitchen is clean and the cats are fed and my brain is on its downward spiral toward sleep, all I want to do is sink into the couch and turn on “House Hunters,” a show about a specific kind of darkness I have complete control in avoiding. It provides all the thrill of a dystopian hellscape with none of the fear."

New York’s Corporate Mom-and-Pop Stores,2018-04-06,article,News,,[],There are more chain stores in the city than ever. But who do you think runs them?,"New Yorkers are forever mourning the death of the funky corner shop at the hands of the soulless, corporate behemoth: an independent bookstore closes, a drugstore chain takes its place. It’s been a lament since at least 1871, when A.&P., probably the earliest national chain, opened its first store outside New York. Two McDonald’s restaurants arrived in Queens in 1967; Starbucks showed up on the Upper West Side in 1994."

The resulting poems were like high-performance cars assembled from junkyard parts, or runway fashions with the stitches intentionally showing. They were, essentially, collages."

"If Graphic Novels Are Hip for Adults, Why Not Picture Books?",2018-04-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"The latest from Sophie Blackall, David Wiesner and Jillian Tamaki show the form at its sophisticated best. They’re a treat for grown-up readers, too.","Modern-day tastemakers, unlike their forebears, shower love on comics and graphic novels without a hint of condescension. This is true even of works intended mainly for children, a category that includes — let’s be honest — most of the superhero sagas that dominate pop culture’s most lucrative precincts. I’m not complaining, by the way (I love comics too), just observing. But picture books are another story. Even the genius likes of Beatrix Potter and Maurice Sendak are shunted off to the critical equivalent of the Thanksgiving kids’ table, smiled at but not often engaged with. Yet the best picture books, far from being baby food, display a pictorial sophistication that puts many graphic novels to shame; think of them as visual haiku, an art form of juxtaposition and implication, bright colors notwithstanding. And here are three examples to prove the point — books full of surface delight that also reward close reading. Kids might love them, but I’m guessing all three will resonate even more with grown-ups."

Review: Joan of Arc Is a Young Headbanger in ‘Jeannette’,2018-04-12,article,Review,,['Movies'],"In his latest film, Bruno Dumont presents an idiosyncratic Joan of Arc: one who has visions of the saints and stomps around to heavy electronic music.","Joan of Arc, a figure both inspiring and mystifying, is depicted frequently in film, but rarely has her girlhood been given a credible cinematic imagining. She was put to death at 19, and most of the actors who have played the saint were well above that age. Most famously, Ingrid Bergman was 32 when she portrayed the 16-to-19-year-old Joan in a 1948 film.

Her art has thrived, in part, on a physical candor that both shocked people and redrew the boundaries of taste, beauty and eroticism around her masculinity, ebony skin and unrelenting intensity. She’s an iconoclast, basically. And I imagine a downside of iconoclasm is that you never get to be a human being.

Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: Disarming Humor in ‘Heads of the Colored People’,2018-04-15,article,Question,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",Nafissa Thompson-Spires’s debut story collection shares its title with a collection of sketches by a 19th-century abolitionist.,"From the opening sentences of the opening story in Nafissa Thompson-Spires’s debut collection, “Heads of the Colored People,” we’re in a world of humor, provocation and deep reflection about cultural signifiers: “Riley wore blue contact lenses and bleached his hair — which he worked with gel and a blow-dryer and a flatiron some mornings into Sonic the Hedgehog spikes so stiff you could prick your finger on them, and sometimes into a wispy side-swooped bob with long bangs — and he was black. But this wasn’t any kind of self-hatred thing.” Ms. Thompson-Spires was inspired by James McCune Smith, a 19th-century abolitionist and doctor whose brief stories about various characters were published under the title “Heads of the Colored People, Done With a Whitewash Brush.” In an author’s note, Ms. Thompson-Spires writes that, like the work of Smith and some of his contemporaries, including William J. Wilson and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, her stories are interested in “black U.S. citizenship, the black middle class and the future of black American life during pivotal sociopolitical moments.” Below, she discusses her surprise at the tone that has developed in her work, the way she was inspired by stand-up comedians in the 1990s and more."

The track, a tribute to an uptown musical culture that most Americans viewed as a curiosity or fad (if they had any awareness of it at all), name-checked a few seminal New York figures, including Grandmaster Flash, the pioneering D.J. whose group the Furious Five formed in 1976 and broke musical ground at house parties in the South Bronx before cracking into the Top 100 in 1982 with the socially conscious rap anthem “The Message,” and Fab 5 Freddy, a Brooklyn-based graffiti artist who acted as a liaison between street artists, the commercial art world and downtown clubs. At the urging of Blondie’s Harry and the band’s guitarist Chris Stein, “S.N.L.” booked the Bronx’s Funky 4 + 1 (four male rappers and pioneering female M.C. Sha-Rock) to perform their single “That’s the Joint” for the show’s final number of the night. Harry’s rapped verse on “Rapture” was, for most people, a proxy introduction to hip-hop, but it was the Funky 4 + 1 that gave network television viewers the first true taste of what young New Yorkers had been experiencing in parks, subways and schoolyards for several years already."

It was a career move suggested by Diana Vreeland, the former editor of American Vogue who was by then a curator to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in Manhattan. “I wanted to design textiles,” the 79-year-old Herrera recalls. “I came to see Diana, and I told her my story and asked whether she liked the idea or not. And she said, ‘My God, that’s very boring. Why don’t you do something else, connected with fashion? Why don’t you do a collection?’ ” So she did. It was around 20 outfits, on a group of models corralled with help from her friend, the designer Bill Blass. It was shown at the Metropolitan Club, an august private social club founded in 1891 by J.P. Morgan and housed on New York’s East 60th Street — the first time the venue had permitted a fashion show within its walls. Musicians played Cole Porter. It was an event."

But not until the early ’80s did it begin appearing with merciless persistence at restaurants across Manhattan, in tart after tart, fruit salads, compotes and even savory dishes, lending an algal tinge to beurre blanc.

Jeff Koons, Peter Halley, Ashley Bickerton, Joan Wallace and Barbara Bloom remember the moment.","By 1981 in New York City, the contemporary art scene was a booming business, with SoHo as its epicenter. Dealers like Leo Castelli, Ileana Sonnabend and Mary Boone championed artists such as David Salle and Julian Schnabel, whom critics labeled Neo-Expressionists, and whose style appealed to a growing art market willing to pay large sums of money for young painters. But just a few blocks and a world away — in the East Village — a smaller but no less important community of galleries was emerging as well, a kind of conceptual and anti-commercial satellite orbiting the art world’s mainstream."

When Models Became as Famous as the Artists they Inspired,2018-04-17,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Models (Professional)', 'Nineteen Hundred Eighties']","In the early ’80s, beguiling muses like Patti Hansen, Farida Khelfa and Pat Cleveland were not just faces, but names — and paved the way for ’90s supermodels.","One of the earliest appearances of the muses was in a narrative poem called “Theogony” by the Greek poet Hesiod, who wrote around 700 B.C. that they were nine sisters born of Zeus and his lover Mnemosyne, or memory. Of them he wrote, “they plucked and gave me a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvelous thing, and breathed into me a divine voice.” Homer invoked the muse for his epic poem (“Sing to me of the man, Muse”) as did Virgil. Over time, the muse became a less incantatory figure and more of a sexual one: The word is commonly used, for example, as a shorthand for the many wives and lovers Pablo Picasso captured in his work. With the rise of the model as celebrity in the latter half of the 20th century, the muse became more objectified. She could be the woman a fashion designer trusted to wear his clothes, both on and off the runway. Or she could be a figure of whom a world-famous photographer’s lens never tired. These women and their looks — from Misia Sert’s bohemian opulence at the turn of the last century to Twiggy’s sprightly boyishness in the 1960s — can be as much an expression of their times as their era’s music, literature or even politics."

These are the people who stayed.","In the late 1950s, when artists started moving downtown, the area was a sprawling wasteland of low level buildings anchored by two largely industrial areas — what we now call SoHo and its neighbor immediately to the south, TriBeCa. Both had begun in the 1600s as colonial farmland; by the 19th century, both had transformed into a shopping and entertainment district, with large hotels, upscale department stores, theaters and hundreds of brothels. After the Civil War, the area became an important manufacturing center for textile firms and other industries, and the brothels were gradually replaced by clusters of cast-iron warehouses. By the 1950s, these warehouses were mostly being used for storage or sweatshops, and the neighborhood, increasingly decrepit, earned the nickname Hell’s Hundred Acres."

11 New Books We Recommend This Week,2018-04-19,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"With this week’s selection of titles, we put ourselves into the hands of experts: expert storytellers, expert thinkers, expert biographers of expert subjects. For instance? As the founding curator of the New York Public Library’s photography collection, Julia Van Haaften is a leading authority on the city’s rich photographic heritage — surely the right person to have produced the first major biography of Berenice Abbott, the larger-than-life artist who captured and defined New York City in some of the 20th century’s most arresting images. Read that, and spend some time lingering over the photos. Also for instance: We recommend fiction by the celebrated masters Thomas McGuane and Richard Powers — whose new novel, “The Overstory,” is reviewed by Barbara Kingsolver, speaking of experts — and nonfiction by Hannah Arendt (about politics), Barbara Ehrenreich (about mortality) and Ross Douthat (about the Catholic Church under Pope Francis). Other choices include a family memoir, a debut novel about a single gay mother, a ghost story and a Nordic thriller with shades of “The Silence of the Lambs.” And if the Abbott biography gets you thinking about the character and destiny of cities, you might want to settle in with Ben Austen’s “High-Risers,” about the ill-fated Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago. It’s not a happy story, but it’s an important one, and Austen, a journalist who frequently writes about urban planning and housing issues, tells it expertly and well."

Start with the name, which alludes to the notion of taking a former bar space, in this case Whiskey Social, and giving it new life. “We’ve kept as much of the stuff that was here as possible,” said Dave Arnold, the avant-garde cocktail master who is in partnership with Don Lee, another drinks innovator, and Greg Boehm, who founded Cocktail Kingdom, which makes and sells barware and books. They will serve some beers and wines, and can stir a proper martini, but that’s beside the point. Their drinks are listed as nonalcoholic (sophisticated, at times sparkling, and priced at $15, the same as the alcoholic selections), carbonated, shaken, stirred straight up or on a big rock.

Justin Strauss first brought a bag of records to spin at the Mudd Club, the downtown New York City bar that’s now the stuff of underground lore, the term “disc jockey” didn’t mean much yet — and it certainly didn’t evoke celebrity status. “It wasn’t anything that anyone thought about — I didn’t think about it,” Strauss says now. “I didn’t wake up and go, ‘I want to be a D.J.’ It just sort of happened naturally.” He had left New York, his hometown, to live in Los Angeles with his power-pop group Milk ’n’ Cookies. The band eventually split and his then-girlfriend persuaded him to come back to the city. “She said, ‘You gotta come. This club opened up and you’d be great to play your records there,’” he remembers. This was the era of the slick, moneyed glamour of Studio 54, and the Mudd Club was, in many ways, a reaction to it. “There were no rules — you could play a rockabilly song next to a rap song or a reggae song or the Buzzcocks or whatever it was — it all made sense and everyone danced,” he said. As for the crowd, it “was just a mix of downtown kids, artists … Keith Haring, Jean-Michel [Basquiat].” Strauss spent the rest of the decade spinning at big — and now shuttered — clubs like Area, the Ritz, Tunnel and Limelight. He ultimately began remixing and producing original tracks; he still D.J.s around the world and has a show on the Lot Radio, based in Brooklyn."
