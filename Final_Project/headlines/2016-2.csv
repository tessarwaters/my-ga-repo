Janet Napolitano Reviews Peter Bergen’s ‘United States of Jihad’,2016-02-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Terrorism']",A study seeks answers to why some ‘ordinary’ citizens become jihadists. ,"Who constitutes a homegrown jihadist, and what distinguishes the terrorist attack in San Bernardino from the mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School? In post-9/11 America, questions like these shape our national discourse on terrorism, law enforcement and public safety. Peter Bergen, CNN’s national security analyst and the author of four other books on terrorism, addresses these and other salient questions in his excellent new “United States of Jihad: Investigating America’s Homegrown Terrorists.” Bergen seeks to understand why some Americans choose to become jihadists, how our institutions have responded to terrorism and how American society has been changed by terrorist threats. Terrorism has long existed in this country — Bergen describes the 1970s as the “golden age” of terrorism in the United States — but the horrific attacks of Sept. 11 and the loss of nearly 3,000 lives on American soil were to earlier terrorist attacks as a tsunami is to a high tide. Just as a tsunami leaves a landscape forever altered once it retreats, so too has Sept. 11 fundamentally changed America. The difficulty Bergen faces in mapping and analyzing post-9/11 homegrown terrorism is the ever shifting, contemporaneous terrain of his subject — it’s a bit like writing a history of the 1960s while the Beatles are still singing. Nonetheless, Bergen’s book is the best one-volume treatment available on the current state of jihad in America."

But the Target Margin Theater, known for radically reinventing classic behemoths, is not about to be daunted by a little excess weight.

Inside the List,2016-02-05,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Roz Chast’s memoir of her parents’ deaths is one of several nuanced considerations of family and mortality on the hardcover graphics list.,"The Cartoonist’s Elegy: Between romance novels and mysteries, love and death have long ruled the fiction lists. But they’re increasingly common in hardcover graphics as well: On this week’s list, nuanced considerations of family and mortality turn up in Adrian Tomine’s story collection “Killing and Dying” (No. 8 after 17 weeks); Tom Hart’s memoir “Rosalie Lightning,” about the death of his 1-year-old daughter (No. 6 after three weeks); and — the book that arguably paved the way in this regard — Roz Chast’s memoir of her parents’ deaths, “Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?” (No. 4 after 91 weeks). Chast’s memoir was chosen as one of the Book Review’s 10 Best Books in 2014, when we wrote that “cartoons, it turns out, are ­tailor-made for the absurdities of old age, illness and dementia.” But the book is equally moving as an account of Chast’s relationship with her parents — in particular her difficult, complicated mother. “I’ve been aware of issues with my mother since I was a little kid,” Chast told me recently via email. “The book didn’t really help me come to terms with them. There are certain things that don’t work out in life, and writing a book is an interesting way to look at those things and think about them. And I’m aware it could have been much, much worse. She had a lot of wonderful qualities: She was strong-willed and very smart. I’ve been told by her former students that she was the best teacher they ever had. But being a mom, which to me is a combination of strength but also flexibility — sometimes a lot of flexibility — was something that didn’t really interest her.”"

It showed a crowd of Chinese watching while one of their compatriots was beheaded by the Japanese, accused of being a Russian spy. “They were all strong fellows but appeared completely apathetic,” Zhou recalled. “After this film I felt that medical science was not so important after all. The people of a weak and backward country, however strong and healthy they may be, can only serve to be made examples of, or to witness such futile spectacles. . . . The most important thing, therefore, was to change their spirit, and since at that time I felt that literature was the best means to this end, I determined to promote a literary movement.”"

Laura Secor’s ‘Children of Paradise: The Struggle for the Soul of Iran’,2016-02-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An American journalist traces how reformists evolved from earlier supporters of the clerical regime.,"In the mid-1980s, a few years after Iran became the world’s first modern revolutionary theocracy, two charismatic intellectuals and their followers conducted a long-running feud over metaphysics in the country’s newspapers and lecture halls. One of the intellectuals, Laura ­Secor writes in “Children of Paradise,” an engrossing but narrowly focused history of the Iranian reform movement, was Abdolkarim Soroush, a champion of the ­Austrian-British philosopher of science and open-society advocate Karl Popper. Farsi translations of Popper’s works were flying off the shelves. But they were being savaged in the press by devotees of Soroush’s rival, Ahmad Fardid, who espoused the views of Martin Heidegger. Many hard-liners in the Islamic Republic were attracted to Heidegger, the midcentury German thinker tainted by his ties to Nazism, as a counter to Western scientific rationalism’s claims to universalism. “Because both philosophers were associated with the ruling regime, their debates were fully aired before the public,” Secor says. “Iranian intellectuals, perhaps thrilling to the aura of purpose, often describe the battle as a war by proxy between Heidegger and Popper.”"
"‘Francis Bacon in Your Blood: A Memoir,’ by Michael Peppiatt",2016-02-05,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Art']",Peppiatt’s remembrance of the painter Francis Bacon is neither tribute nor apologia.,"When Michael Peppiatt, at 21, met Francis Bacon, the 53-year-old artist was already all artifice, well spoken when well rehearsed, his bistro doctrines applauded by clinking glasses. Peppiatt, having taken over a student arts journal at Cambridge, had shown up in London’s Soho. It was 1963, and Peppiatt laid claim to but a tenuous introduction to the renowned painter he sought. At the bar of the French House, the youth was handled by the photographer John Deakin, who loudly advised: “My dear, you should consider that the maestro you mention has as of late become so famous that she no longer talks to the flotsam and jetsam. . . . I fear she wouldn’t even consider meeting a mere student like you!”"

Sometimes things begin with the wrong book.” Thus opens Darryl Pinckney’s haunting second novel, “Black Deutschland.” The “wrong book” in question is Christopher Isherwood’s “Berlin Stories,” the literary source for the musical “Cabaret,” and inspiration for Pinckney’s protagonist to seek refuge in what became the unofficial capital of the Cold War. It’s the early 1980s, and Jed, a young man from Chicago with an addiction problem, is trying to flee his hometown’s suffocating racism and homophobia by expatriating himself to Berlin, a city he hopes will accept him and his desires as it did Isherwood’s a half-century earlier."

The topic lingers behind euphemisms for a few years, and then someone calls it forth again: Elisabeth Kübler-Ross with her disciplined “On Death and Dying” in 1969; Susan Sontag with her angry but profound “Illness as Metaphor” in 1978 and the empathetic follow-up “AIDS and Its Metaphors,” in 1988; Derek Humphry, implausibly, with his suicide handbook “Final Exit” in 1991; Sherwin Nuland with his magisterial “How We Die” in 1993; more recently, Joan Didion with her agonizingly precise “The Year of Magical Thinking” in 2005; and Atul Gawande with his humane “Being Mortal” in 2014. Each of these books argues, one way or another, for a continuum between life and its conclusion. The gloss of youthful vitality can persuade us that life is for the living, but life is also for the dying, and repudiating that ultimate punctuation escalates our anxiety and deprives us of final dignity. Time and again, we must clarify our individual and collective beliefs about how the last chapter changes the rest of the narrative. “Or not to be” is not in fact a question."

East Meets West in a One-of-a-Kind Cartier Pendant,2016-02-08,article,News,,['Jewels and Jewelry'],Art Deco geometry mingles with Indian exoticism in an opal and sapphire necklace from the French jeweler.,"The jeweled panther may be the most recognizable symbol of Cartier, but the historic French house has always nurtured a subtler, more abstract side as well.

"‘Forty Rooms,’ by Olga Grushin",2016-02-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Grushin’s novel, a woman who dreams of being a poet wrestles with compromise and heartbreak.","The structure of Olga Grushin’s original new novel, “Forty Rooms,” is ingeniously simple. Over several decades, we follow the Russian-born narrator ­— an aspiring poet turned American housewife — into the 40 rooms that represent the topography of a privileged, middle-class woman’s life. We are taken from the “stuffy and bright” Moscow apartment bathroom — the first place to “emerge from the haze of nonbeing” when the protagonist is not yet 5 — to the suburban America entrance hall from which she will finally depart. And along the way, we come of age with the person whom we know, tellingly, only as Mrs. Caldwell. Or perhaps I should say, we come of ages with Mrs. Caldwell, because as any woman in her fifth decade or beyond can attest, most of us come of age in many stages: as daughter, as wife, as mother, as . . . you get the idea. It is a mark of the author’s skill that, while sweeping us along in Mrs. Caldwell’s particular narrative, Grushin indirectly challenges the reader to reflect on her own history; to come up with the labels that contribute to her own identity — writer, sister, for example — and to name the rooms in which she has come to her own realizations."

"‘Valley of the Dolls,’ by the Numbers",2016-02-09,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],The pop culture classic remains as gleefully salacious as ever — even as it turns 50.,"When the actress Jacqueline Susann was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1962, she made a deal with God: She would settle for 10 more years of life. . . if she could become the world’s most popular writer. In the 12 years that followed, she became just that: the first novelist to achieve three consecutive New York Times No. 1 best sellers, and one of the richest self-made women in America. Her first novel, ‘‘Valley of the Dolls,’’ remains a pop-culture touchstone: a gleefully salacious story of friendship, sex, backstabbing and pills (or ‘‘dolls’’) that won famous fans and detractors alike. (Susann, who died in 1974, made hundreds of appearances to support the novel and is credited with inventing the modern book tour.) Now celebrating its 50th anniversary, the tawdry tale of Anne Welles, Jennifer North and Neely O’Hara hasn’t lost its punch. Here, a look at the vital stats behind one of the most talked-about books of all time."

When a diver descends in the water, where there’s only one way out, he is crossing a line, entering a world in which he is entirely reliant on his own resources. So when the diver finally emerges, the relief is almost palpable."

Inside the List,2016-02-12,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"Adam Grant’s “Originals,” No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list, overlaps with Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers” in substance as well as style.","Prophets of Doom: Some authors so thoroughly dominate their genre that rivals may want to invoke the Sherman Antitrust Act. Malcolm Gladwell, for instance, is the king of pithily titled, sociologically inflected narrative nonfiction with a vaguely entrepreneurial self-help feel; his “Outliers” has spent 208 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list and is currently No. 7 on the monthly business list. So it seems almost cheeky that the Wharton School professor Adam Grant has settled, for his latest addition to the field, on the pithy title “Originals.” Grant’s book, which debuts at No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list — and comes with a front-cover endorsement from Gladwell — overlaps with “Outliers” in substance as well as style: Both propose to explain why some people rise above their peers to change the world. (Gladwell emphasizes practice; Grant, passion and nonconformity.) Readers of the Book Review may be particularly interested in one study Grant cites, in which a psychologist gave subjects an actual New York Times book review, modified to make it either extremely positive or extremely negative, then asked them to rate the critic’s intelligence. “Which version makes the reviewer sound smarter?” Grant asks. “People rated the critical reviewer as 14 percent more intelligent, and having 16 percent greater literary expertise, than the complimentary reviewer. People think an amateur can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it.” Or, as the original researcher put it, “Prophets of doom and gloom appear wise and insightful, while positive statements are seen as having a naïve ‘Pollyanna’ quality.”"

"‘Salt to the Sea,’ by Ruta Sepetys",2016-02-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This young adult novel set in the closing days of World War II is based on a real-life maritime disaster.,"A group of teenage refugees meet on the road in the chaotic countryside of East Prussia in winter 1945. The Nazi Reich is collapsing all around them, and they, like hundreds of thousands, are fleeing the wrathful Soviet advance. They are trapped between their German conquerors and their terrifying Russian “liberators.” Their story is told through the ­voices of Joana, a pretty Lithuanian nurse; Florian, a Prussian with a mysterious letter of passage from a high-ranking Nazi officer; and Emilia, an idealistic but damaged Polish girl in a pink knit cap. Thrown together, struggling to survive, they at first hardly trust one another enough even to exchange names, and so they often just use epithets: “the knight,” “the nurse,” “the Polish girl,” “the wandering boy,” “the shoe poet.” (The last, an old cobbler, gets his name from his philosophy: “The shoes always tell the story.”) Each has secrets — the galling histories that haunt anyone who has lived through war, flight and deprivation."

First encountered in 1920 as a lonely 11-year-old trapped in the Holy Land by her father’s government job, Prue is allowed to wander the desert with her own Kodak. There she runs into Willie, the shellshocked aviator her father has hired to survey Jerusalem and help modernize the city — that is, to make it more like London, with tidy public parks and signs of Arab habitation removed."

Even before the narrative begins, a hint of disquiet creeps in with the epigraph: “The annihilation is not the terror. The journey is the terror.” Forget the explicit reference to terror; a clammier sort of eeriness settles on the reader who pauses to research the identity of the epigraph’s supposed source, Elihu Hoopes, who turns out to be the “man without a shadow” of the title. To enter these pages is to enter a world of smoke and mirrors, rendered all the more insidious by the realization that this purports to be a world of objective truth, a world of scientific inquiry."

"‘Where My Heart Used to Beat,’ by Sebastian Faulks",2016-02-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A self-destructing veteran finally confronts his memories and the mystery of his father’s death.,"Sebastian Faulks’s latest novel explores the burden of Britain’s participation in the 20th century’s two major wars, as embodied in the experiences of Robert Hendricks, a psychiatrist and writer whose father died under murky circumstances during World War I and who is himself a lovelorn veteran of World War II. Readers of Faulks’s fiction, most notably of the loose trilogy formed by “Birdsong,” “The Girl at the Lion d’Or” and “Charlotte Gray,” know that his wartime plots tend to involve men and women finding and losing each other. Faulks’s appeal and popularity come from his confident balancing of historically accurate detail with ardent, even over-the-top sympathy for passionate private lives."

"‘Pax,’ by Sara Pennypacker",2016-02-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Forced to separate, a boy and his pet fox (for whom the author translates) go on adventures of discovery and maturation.","Foxes are fable animals: Their fur carries the electric charge of literary history. As with cats, their faces suggest they have no need of us, and in literature they have all the power that goes with independence. There are the foxes in Machiavelli’s “The Prince” (“One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps. . . . ”) and Jean de La Fontaine’s verses, and there’s Disney’s Robin Hood, matinee idol that he was. For me the most memorable literary fox until now has been the baby fox in Ted Hughes’s poem “Epiphany” — a distilled ball of “mannerless energy” and “old smell,” and a test of the poet’s ability to bend his life and marriage to fit the presence of something so wild and destructive, and so beautiful. Pax, the eponymous fox of Sara Pennypacker’s new novel, is built on the model of Hughes’s cub, half wild and half domesticated, a galvanic presence fit to join the ranks of fiction’s great foxes."

"‘Weathering,’ by Lucy Wood",2016-02-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The beauty and humanity of a daughter’s remembrance drive this debut novel.,"“She made marmalade cake and soup with carrots and ginger; trying to replace the smell of damp with cooking smells. But still: damp shoes, damp clothes, the dank smell of river. The leak in the hall splitting the ceiling like the crust of a loaf.” The snowed-in feeling of Lucy Wood’s captivating debut novel, “Weathering,” comes from such descriptions of the house Ada has inherited upon her mother’s death, to which she has brought her young daughter, Pepper. This dampness so pervades the book that it almost swells the pages, and the imagery typifies Wood’s wonderful and energetic style, all the way down to the smallest detail: “She found a silty smudge, like a handprint, on the outside of the kitchen window and a small pile of stones on the front steps.” Lest you settle down too comfortably in this winter cabin of a novel: The handprint is that of her dead mother, Pearl."

"‘West of Eden,’ by Jean Stein",2016-02-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In “West of Eden,” Jean Stein continues the project she began in “Edie,” recording our nation’s “trickster promise.”","Oral history looks all too easy. When the Belarussian writer Svetlana Alexievich won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature for her oral histories of humanitarian crises, it seemed an overdue confirmation of the genre’s literary nature — not just its capacity to tell sweeping, timeless human stories, but also the craft and cunning involved in its artful assemblage of specific, individual voices. In this country the form has proved to be both a serious vehicle for popular history and a reliable producer of best sellers, beginning with Studs Terkel’s “Working” in 1974. But it was Jean Stein’s 1982 book “Edie: American Girl,” edited with George Plimpton, that gave oral history the particular shimmer that comes when lofty literary aims happen to coincide with sheer entertainment value. “Edie” conjured the tragic life of Edith Sedgwick, who was born into a patrician New England family, grew up with seven siblings on isolated ­ranches near Santa Barbara under the yoke of a semi-deranged father, came east and after a stint in a mental hospital became Andy Warhol’s arm candy and a figure in New York counterculture, before being cast out by him and dying at 28 of an overdose. In many ways Stein’s new book, “West of Eden,” continues the larger project she began in “Edie”: chronicling a trickster promise embedded in our national consciousness — something shining and elusive and at its center not just ugly but quite often deadly."

I have one client whom I like very much and who has requested my services a number of times, but whenever I leave that client’s house, I find myself troubled. This family has a teacup pig, which lives with them in a medium-size apartment. I consider myself an animal lover, and it so happens that I have looked into the fad of teacup pigs. I know that they are really piglets of a larger variety, the potbellied pig, which are unintentionally underfed by owners who have been led by dishonest sellers to believe that the pigs need to eat less than they really do. Right now the pig is small, perhaps 10 to 15 pounds, but I know it will keep growing and that the lowest healthy weight for a full-grown ‘‘teacup pig’’ is about 60 pounds; a potbellied pig can easily grow to more than 100 pounds. I asked the family how big the pig would get, thinking perhaps they knew the facts and had some plan. They told me that they expect it to remain the size it is now. The worst part? They often remark that the pig is acting hungry; I imagine they feed him the too-small amount they were directed to by the seller. I believe that this family loves their pig very much and that I am witnessing an unintentional act of animal cruelty, but I am in a quandary: Should I tell them that they are unwittingly mistreating their beloved pet? I worry that I would be overstepping my professional bounds. People can be very touchy when it comes to their pets, and I want to maintain cordial relations with them for the sake of my continued employment.

"‘Over-Scheduled Andrew,’ by Ashley Spires",2016-02-17,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A new picture book about a harried little bird takes aim at the current vogue for jam-packing children’s days with adult-run activities.,"There are some picture books that reach for timelessness, offering no details that give away exactly when the story is taking place, or when it was written. And there are some that speak directly to their moment. “Over-Scheduled Andrew” is (you guessed it) firmly in the latter camp, taking aim at the current vogue for jam-packing children’s days with adult-run activities. This book represents the backlash against the frantic pursuit of what’s often known as “enrichment,” a term that can seem most apropos for the wallets of the adults who teach and coach all these after-school classes, teams and activities. Spires’s message is not subtle: She writes as an unapologetic champion of the idea that, rather than pushing elementary-schoolers into organized, goal-oriented pursuits, we would enrich their lives more by offering them, say, a couple of unstructured hours with a giant cardboard box, some scissors, packing tape and markers, and no grown-ups chirping directions at them."

The other program, dedicated to George Balanchine, shows Mr. Boal’s City Ballet roots with “Square Dance,” “Prodigal Son” and “Stravinsky Violin Concerto.” That one is a slam dunk.

Murder is committed on camera, witnesses pose for selfies, footage is posted online, but no one investigates. Ships intentionally dump more oil and sludge into the ocean every three years than the Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez spills combined.

For the last few years, Lahiri, whose first language is Bengali, has been reading and writing exclusively, if haltingly, in Italian out of fondness for the language, but also, she told NPR in an interview, “for another kind of need, I suppose — a more irrational, emotional need.” Although she allows she’s still wobbly — “I grope my way, like a child, like a semiliterate” — she’s found her way back to a purer pleasure in reading. “After I finish a book, I’m thrilled,” she writes in the memoir. “It seems like a feat.

Thirty years had passed since this seasoned film critic (then for New York, later The New Yorker) first experienced Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Shakespeare and the rest of the Western canon as an 18-year-old. At the time, that curriculum was at the heart of an impassioned culture war over whether the work of “dead white guys” — as some reformers derided them — remained relevant or appropriate for a multicultural generation of American college students. Denby’s answer was an unqualified yes, an ecstatic, critically praised paean to Western thought and literature entitled “Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World.”"

But her tender friendship with Roosevelt, sustained over nearly a quarter-century and more than 300 cards and letters, helped. It is the rich earth Patricia Bell-Scott tills for “The Firebrand and the First Lady,” a tremendous book that has been 20 years in the making."

Trump’s record as a businessman. Far from mastering “The Art of the Deal” — the title of his 1987 best seller — Trump made real estate blunders that turned billions in potential profits into mere millions. His foray into Atlantic City brought him perilously close to personal bankruptcy. As for all his claims about owning a sprawling business empire, what he actually runs these days is a licensing company that slaps the Trump name on everything from buildings to steaks to an education company that was sued by New York State in 2013 for “persistent fraudulent, illegal and deceptive conduct.” My conclusion — and I say this as a grizzled veteran of business journalism — was that Trump’s business acumen (not to mention his net worth) was wildly overstated, not least by Trump himself. His core business skill is self-promotion."

The character’s behavior has to evoke repulsion in the readers, meanwhile engaging their sympathy for the suffering soul beneath. In Ethan Canin’s new novel, “A Doubter’s Almanac,” the mathematician Milo Andret is certainly despicable enough. With relish and malice, he manipulates the lives of his family members. He humiliates his wife, curses his daughter and bedevils his son. He uses women. He demeans his colleagues. He is a raging, nasty drunk. Twice, he nearly commits murder. In the face of all this, can Canin also portray him as a tragic figure worthy of pity? The novel’s success hinges upon the answer."

"‘Echo Echo,’ by Marilyn Singer",2016-02-24,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A new picture book presents ingenious poems about Greek mythology that can be read in both directions.,"Marilyn Singer’s ingenious “reverso” poems are child-friendly feats of verbal pyrotechnics: They can be read from the top down or the bottom up, with just small changes of punctuation and capitalization. Reading in each direction yields a completely different meaning and point of view. Singer keeps the poems to a dozen or so mostly short lines, some just one word long, so they look spacious on the page and are easily accessible to younger child readers. Her first two collections, “Mirror Mirror” and “Follow Follow,” retold classic fairy tales. Now she’s plunging into Greek mythology with “Echo, Echo,” and the results are just as much fun, no matter the age of the reader. The economical summary of each myth at the bottom of the page is a special bonus for those of us who can never quite keep straight certain crucial details and plot lines. After spending time with this book, I may never again confuse Eurydice and Persephone."

Michael Brendan Dougherty has a good column on all the ways that this would be a disaster for the conservative movement — how it would weaken the influence of conservatism’s major institutions (by exposing how “inessential” their ideas and imprimatur are to actually winning power in the G.O.P.), how it would turn the right’s personnel and policy minds against one another (some would throw in with Team Trump, others wouldn’t, and the recriminations would be vicious), and how it would create a particular crisis for the pro-life movement, because Trump’s “conversion on the issue is far less convincing than those of previous nominees like Mitt Romney or George H.W. Bush,” and one way or another his nomination would probably guarantee that genuinely anti-Roe justices would be “reduced to a tiny rump on a consolidated, progressive Supreme Court.”"

What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team,2016-02-25,article,News,,"['Productivity', 'Workplace Environment', 'Psychology and Psychologists', 'Labor and Jobs']",New research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.,"Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn’t a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit. Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. All she knew for certain was that she wanted to find a job that was more social. ‘‘I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together,’’ she told me. She thought about various opportunities — Internet companies, a Ph.D. program — but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management."
Rethinking the Work-Life Equation,2016-02-25,article,News,,"['Work-Life Balance', 'Working Hours', 'Workplace Environment', 'Sociology', 'Telecommuting']",It takes more than just policies to make a workplace truly flexible. The whole office culture has to change.,"Phyllis Moen, a sociologist who was widowed when her two children were young, has made a career studying the challenges of working full time while raising a family. She was an early voice calling for the government to provide paid maternity leave and offer benefits for part-time workers, but eventually, when she saw no signs of progress, she began considering instead the ways that corporations could reconfigure work to address the realities of the modern employee, who was more likely than ever to be a single parent or part of a dual-income couple. ‘‘We wanted to do a field experiment at a corporation that reduced its hours,’’ she said, ‘‘but realized nobody would let us do that. We thought they would be more willing to experiment with giving workers more control.’’"
Is Blind Hiring the Best Hiring?,2016-02-25,article,News,,"['Hiring and Promotion', 'Discrimination', 'Computers and the Internet', 'Minorities', 'Blacks', 'Black People', 'Race and Ethnicity']","Most companies say they want to attract a diverse workforce, but few deliver. The only solution may be a radical one: anonymity.","A few years ago, Kedar Iyer, an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, became acutely aware of a problem in his industry: A surfeit of talented coders were routinely overlooked by employers because they lacked elite pedigrees. Hiring managers, he thought, were too often swayed by the name of a fancy college on a résumé. To try to address the problem, he created a software company called GapJumpers, working with employers to create challenges for applicants that mimicked what people would do on the job. Companies using GapJumpers wouldn’t see candidates’ résumés, just their names, photographs and test results. In theory, this process would shift employers’ focus from résumés to skills. Then, two years ago, he came across an idea that caused him to rethink his business."

The program he presents for his solo recital at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday, March 3, is a riddle of sorts, too, a musical palindrome. After opening with one Bach Partita (No. 6), it moves on to early Schumann, pauses on the Impressionist-Symbolist reverie of Szymanowski’s “Metopes,” then reverses its steps through late Schumann and back to Bach (Partita No. 1). “Metopes,” based on three Classical friezes depicting stages of Homer’s “The Odyssey,” are lovely works that are too rarely played and that seem to look both forward and backward. The first is inspired by Odysseus’s encounter with the Sirens. It will be haunting to hear it followed by Schumann’s “Ghost Variations,” the last work he wrote before being confined to a mental institution; according to experts, Schumann tried to drown himself in the Rhine between the composition of the fourth and fifth variations.

Expect something more adventurous from the director Ivo van Hove, who staged the stripped-down revival of Mr. Miller’s “A View from the Bridge.” He has an equally impressive roster to work with, including Saoirse Ronan, Ben Whishaw and Ciaran Hinds.

The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the measure in a 10-to-9 bipartisan vote. Florida’s extremely porous geology raised fears among environmentalists and Florida residents that well stimulation could more easily lead to contamination of underground aquifers, the source of drinking water for almost all Floridians. The bill, which had passed the House, proposed regulating only two forms of well stimulation in the state but left out a third method, matrix acidizing, that is conducted with low pressure. It also would not require oil and gas companies to reveal all of the chemicals they would put into the ground because some are protected by federal law. The legislation called for a study on the potential effect of well stimulation, but matrix acidizing would not be part of the study. Local governments objected to the legislation because it would prohibit them from banning well stimulation. Nearly 80 counties and cities have passed resolutions or ordinances that banned or opposed fracking. The bill can be called up again in the Senate committee. Well stimulation is not regulated in Florida and does not require a separate permit. "

Should Democrats Fear Trump?,2016-02-26,article,News,,"['Debates (Political)', 'Presidential Election of 2016']",Last night’s debate offered one reason to think that he can’t beat Hillary.,"My insta-take on last night’s debate isn’t particularly original: Marco Rubio’s shrinking violet act this week turned out to be a head fake, he battered and — above all — mocked Donald Trump in ways that Republicans should have been battering him and mocking him all along, and Trump’s counterpunches were weak and Rubio did what poor Jeb Bush never managed and talked over him, denying him the chance to let his punchlines land. Between Rubio and Ted Cruz, who was also on offense, there was still probably too much talk about how Trump is not a real conservative, and too little in the way of efforts to actually co-opt the valid parts of Trump’s critiques of organized conservatism and the Republican Party. And if Trump somehow wins that will be the deep story — that his rivals just couldn’t grasp how disaffected their voters were from the Bush-and-after record and the present party line. But what we saw last night was at least, and at last, the obvious way of taking down Trump, the way that I’ve assumed will work all along. Now we’ll find out if it’s too late."

Inside the List,2016-02-26,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],William Shatner’s new book about his 50-year relationship with Leonard Nimoy is No. 11 on the hardcover nonfiction list. Readers looking for gossip about Kirk and Spock won’t be disappointed.,"O Captain: William Shatner’s new book, “Leonard,” about his 50-year relationship with his “Star Trek” co-star and occasional frenemy Leonard Nimoy, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 11. Readers looking for gossip about Kirk and Spock won’t be disappointed — there’s plenty here about contract disputes, on-set rivalries and substance abuse, along with the revelation that Nimoy, who died in 2015 at the age of 83, essentially stopped speaking to Shatner for the last several years of his life because Shatner had filmed him without permission for a documentary about the Starship Enterprise. But Shatner also devotes generous space to his friend’s sensitive artistic side, taking note of Nimoy’s photographic pursuits and seven volumes of poetry — including, in 1973, the surprisingly successful debut “You & I,” which went through five print runs in hardcover and had an initial paperback printing of 250,000 copies. “What helped sell the book, of course, was the fact that Leonard was willing to promote it by doing bookstore signings,” Shatner writes. “It may have been Leonard’s poetry — but fans were getting Spock’s autograph.” What did Shatner think of the work? “Trying to understand poets through their poetry requires higher degrees than I have,” he writes, “but it is obvious reading his work that from the beginning to the end Leonard was intent on emotionally defining grand themes like love, compassion, loss and the endless search for roots. For the man who became famous playing the ultimate dispassionate character, his poems successfully bring out the range of important emotions.”"

Her new book studies the phenomenon of conversion, since she is upset that people still find ways to accept “goofy religious myths.” Sometimes she writes as if it is a personal insult to her for people to have any religion. She resents the fact that a nun of the Dominican order, singing a tribute to the order’s founder, St. Dominic, did so with a “mind-numbing refrain that still pounds in my cortex as ‘Dominiqua-niqua-niqua.’ ” She writes to prove that the so-called religious experience of conversion often has a secular explanation — then she offers a broad range to choose from."

"‘Vinyl’ Season 1, Episode 3: Rock Star Karaoke",2016-02-29,article,Review,,['Television'],"When “Vinyl” incorporates historical figures into its world, they often seem slightly off.","“Vinyl” isn’t the first TV show to fill out its cast of characters with a parade of real-life music stars from the past: “American Dreams,” for example, which ran on NBC from 2002 to 2005, was centered on the 1960s era of Dick Clark’s music program “American Bandstand,” and included modern singers impersonating older ones (John Legend as Stevie Wonder, Usher as Marvin Gaye, Jennifer Love Hewitt as Nancy Sinatra). When a show pulls off this stunt, it can bring the past and the present into a dialogue — when it fails, it can feel like one long Halloween episode. “Vinyl” hasn’t carved any pumpkins yet, but I worry that the show has a jumbo bag of fun-size Nestle Crunch stashed in the pantry."
