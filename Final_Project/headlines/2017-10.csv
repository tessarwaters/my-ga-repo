In “The Naughty Nineties,” David Friend turns instead to the 1990s, when those same baby boomers were in positions of greater power: from Bill Clinton in the White House to Howard Stern on the radio to the producers Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray on MTV with “The Real World.” Friend finds that the decade’s sexual and political attitudes shaped, in ways both progressive and conservative, the ground we stand on today. On one side are widespread moves to the left on social issues. “But a good case can be made,” he also writes, that Donald J. Trump’s presidency “would never have been possible had the 1990s not normalized and formalized personal branding, reality programming, 24/7 news, tabloid scandal coverage and online self-expression.” Below, Friend discusses how Viagra inspired the book, how the election of Trump changed his plans and more."

His father, Yun Fa Tang, known as Shorty, arrived in New York in 1963 and introduced Sichuan food and notably sesame noodles. Chen Lien Tang put the family name on many restaurants before retiring to spend time in China, New York and Taiwan. But he recently became bored. “He’s getting old, and he felt the need to do it again, one last time,” said his son, James Tang, who is also involved in the business. Last spring, the family opened Shorty Tang Noodles in Chelsea. Now, they have installed a grand restaurant seating about 350 on three floors in the family-owned building (formerly the Bank of China) next door to where Shorty Tang, who died at 50, opened his original Hwa Yuan restaurant in 1968. (The restaurant closed in the 1980s.) The elder Mr. Tang, now 66, designed the new restaurant, seeing to every detail, including richly hand-carved doors he brought from China. “I’m going to remake history here,” he said. “Sesame noodles, fine scallion pancakes, Sichuan kung pao chicken done simply, the way it’s supposed to be, just with chiles and garlic.” He will also serve some banquet dishes on a menu that leans toward Sichuan heat but not exclusively so. He plans to try new ideas, he said, because “times have changed.” Among them are raw-bar selections displayed at one end of the bar in the front dining room, and cheesecake for dessert. (Opens Thursday): 42 East Broadway (Catherine Street), 212-966-6002."

Do you think your job is the same today as it was, say, 10 months ago? What the audience expects hasn’t changed. People come to us for the same reasons: to be educated and informed. My biggest change is that I feel the need to reinforce the wall between the news media and the politicians. The wall has always been there, but sometimes there have been too many holes in it. One legitimate criticism of the political press over the last two decades has been the appearance of coziness between people in the media and the political elite. It’s a lot easier for me, say, as a sports fan to accept a personal fandom, whereas in politics, I’m not going to tell anybody whom I vote for, not even my kids, who ask me all the time, because their friends ask them."

"My Obsession With the Necks, the Greatest Trio on Earth",2017-10-04,article,News,,['Jazz'],"Exploring nearly 30 years of genre-bending, improvisational work.","Ideally this article would start with a single-word sentence. A single short word. A short word like “quiet” or, in musical terminology, “piano.” That word, “piano,” would be repeated. It would be repeated several times. As it was repeated, we would become conscious that it had changed, that in the process of being repeated it had changed, quietly, had expanded from quiet to quietly, imperceptibly. And as this imperceptible change became perceptible, so we would notice that another deeper aspect of its meaning — also simple — was making itself felt: a basic figure of speech, a bass figure. Alongside piano and bass something else would emerge, a rustle so faint it could be nothing, a nothing stirring into something that sounds breeze-scattered: a rattle, dimly perceived, moving so slowly it will have to develop significantly before it can be recognized — measured — by the form of time known, since the dawn of time, as rhythm and, later, as percussion. At some point — though the key point is that we will not be able to say with certainty when, where or how this point was achieved — piano, bass and drums will have moved either into a deep propulsive groove or into a maelstrom of relentless intensity. And then, after an extended stretch of time, the music will subside — or plunge — back to the silence from which it emerged faintly, quietly. So this article, ideally, would unfold in a single, long paragraph as a way of approximating the experience of listening to a typical performance by the Necks, the Australian trio who, for the last dozen years, have obsessed me to the point of mania."

Corker Told the Truth About Trump. Now He Should Act on It.,2017-10-10,article,Op-Ed,,"['United States Politics and Government', 'United States International Relations', 'Nuclear Weapons']","If Senator Bob Corker believes Donald Trump can’t be trusted with the power he holds, shouldn’t he be trying to take that power away?","Over the past few months, the country has been in a foul sort of trance. Among people who work in politics, Republicans as well as Democrats, it is conventional wisdom that President Trump is staggeringly ill-informed, erratic, reckless and dishonest. (He also might be compromised by a hostile foreign power.) But it’s also conventional wisdom that with few exceptions, Republicans in Congress are not going to stand up to him. America’s nuclear arsenal is in the hands of a senescent Twitter troll, but those with political power have refused to treat this fact as a national emergency. Thus, even though a majority of Americans consider the president unfit for office, a fatalistic sense of stasis has set in."

Poor people are like a bonsai tree. You take the best seed from the tallest tree in the forest, but if you put it in a flower pot to grow, it grows only a meter high. There’s nothing wrong with the seed. The problem is the size of the pot. Society doesn’t give poor people the space to grow as tall as everybody else. This is the crux of the matter.”"

From this isolated, antique outpost, Kubitschek, who is 47, wields considerable influence over far-right thinkers, activists and politicians across Germany, who make regular pilgrimages to Schnellroda for an audience with him. The manor serves as the headquarters for the magazine and publishing house that Kubitschek runs with his wife, the writer Ellen Kositza, and also for a rightist think tank, the plainly named Institute for State Policy, and a small organic farm where he raises rabbits and goats. Kubitschek calls himself a conservative, battling to preserve Germany’s “ethno-cultural identity,” which he says is threatened by immigration and the alienating effects of modernity. He identifies as part of the German “New Right,” which seeks to dissociate itself from the “old right,” which in Germany means Nazis. German political scientists, by contrast, classify the brand of thinking Kubitschek ascribes to as either an ideological “hinge” between conservatism and right-wing extremism, or as simply extremist — not vastly different, in other words, from the old right. Kubitschek, however, presents his views with a disarming, Teutonic idealism that recalls a Germany that long preceded the rise of Hitler. The German magazine Der Spiegel once referred to him as a “dark knight.”"

The other was Roy Moore, a twice-defrocked State Supreme Court justice described last month by the conservative National Review as “nothing more than a bigoted, theocratic and ignorant buffoon,” who has argued variously that Muslims shouldn’t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, that multiple Midwestern communities are currently governed by Shariah law and that the Sept. 11 attacks might have been divine punishment for America’s sins."

More than 50 feet up from the ground was a tiny attic window.

Earth has been around for only 4.5 billion years. About 2.7 billion years ago, basalt lava flowed underwater near what’s now the state’s border with Canada; the lava hardened, and the creep of geologic time turned it into a bedrock of greenstone and granite. On top of it, a layer of sedimentary rock rich in iron ore formed nearly two billion years ago, when the region was ocean floor. Then a billion years ago, Earth’s crust cracked open, producing a 50-mile-wide fissure stretching from Lake Superior to Kansas. For the next 100 million years, lava bubbled up into what geologists call the Midcontinent Rift, forming a mineral deposit filled with copper and nickel. Settlers first made their way to the area in 1865 in a fruitless search for gold. What they did find was iron ore, and lots of it. Rails were laid for iron-ore transport, and the town of Ely was founded a few years later, in 1888."

Film Series in NYC This Week,2017-10-12,article,News,,['Movies'],Our guide to film series and special screenings. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.,"‘COMIN’ AT YA!: 3-D 35MM’ at the Quad Cinema (Oct. 13-19). Today’s 3-D movies use digital projection, but that stereoscopic effect was originally achieved by having two overlapping images projected from strips of film. The revival of 3-D cheese-fests in the 1980s afforded a rite of passage to some rising stars of the decade, including Molly Ringwald in “Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone 3-D” (Oct. 13), Dennis Quaid in “Jaws 3-D” (Oct. 15 and Oct. 17) and Demi Moore in “Parasite 3-D” (Oct. 18). But the attraction of a retrospective like the Quad’s is a chance to see rare formats in action. Arch Oboler’s “The Bubble” (Oct. 14), from 1966, was recently restored for digital projection, but the Quad will present it in its original 35-millimeter “Space-Vision.” Instead of two projectors running simultaneously — one for each eye — as was the practice in the 1950s, Space-Vision achieved the 3-D effect using one projector and one film strip with two images in every frame. This will be the first known screening of the original roadshow version since Mr. Oboler cut the film by more than 20 minutes in 1968, says Robert Furmanek, founder and chief executive of the 3-D Film Archive. 212-255-2243, quadcinema.com"

There was that time my hosts served an omelet topped with ice cream and old coffee grounds — oh, and we were in a treehouse.

Or that fancy dinner I gave where a bunch of crashers showed up, smoked weed out of corncob pipes and then left, taking an entire homemade pie with them. I shouldn’t even mention my brief mania for giving “theme” dinners in which the theme was known only to me: the Prematurely Bald Men Party; the Dinner at Which Everyone’s Boyfriend Is Named Dave; the All-Strangers Spaghetti Gala. Perhaps the most memorable of all, though, was a dinner party I had when I was 18, mostly because it was the first I ever executed completely on my own. I feel, in a way, that it was formative and that all dinner parties since then have been influenced in some way by the events of that evening."

‘The Deuce’ Season 1 Finale: Swept Up,2017-10-30,article,Review,,['Television'],The finale was a violent reminder of the price women pay for misogyny.,"The first season of “The Deuce” ends, fittingly, with a screening of “Deep Throat,” the 1972 box office phenomenon that ushered in the era of “porno chic,” when hard-core pornography infiltrated theaters and production values rose accordingly.

But Mason wasn’t deterred: He trained at the Otis and Chouinard art institutes under master ceramists Susan Peterson and Peter Voulkos, and was among the first artists to show at L.A.’s now-iconic Ferus Gallery, known for championing art that bridged the gap between high and low. (Warhol’s soup cans debuted there in 1962, as did John Altoon’s lyrical, quasi-Abstract Expressionist “Ocean Park” paintings.) In the decades since, the now-90-year-old Mason has become renowned for his simple geometric forms (spears, crosses and torqued pillars), which he fires in a room-size kiln in his downtown L.A. studio. An upcoming solo show at Albertz Benda gallery in N.Y.C. will highlight some of his towering columnar works, along with more intimately proportioned, pedestal-friendly sculptures, most of them never previously seen. Some unfold vertically like the gills of an accordion, swiveling effortlessly up from their bases; others stand stoically, their smooth surfaces defined by crisp edges. Glazed in rich, earthy hues like turquoise and burnt umber, they are arresting reminders of an artist who superseded the technical limits of clay — as well as the superficial opposition of art and craft, paving the way for later artists such as Sterling Ruby and Brie Ruais. — LIZ HIRSCH"
