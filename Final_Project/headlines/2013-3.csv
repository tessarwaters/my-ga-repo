Readers are much more likely to remember a byline with Teddy, my somewhat gravitas-deficient nickname since birth, than one with my more common legal name, Derek. According to the Social Security database, in 1979, the year I was born, Teddy was the 485th-most-popular male name; Derek was ranked 72. These days, I’m not even in the top thousand. "
Die Laughing,2013-03-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Satire mingles with warmth and pathos in Sam Lipsyte’s second collection of stories.,"There’s a point at which garden-­variety fecklessness bleeds into tragedy, but where? How? To what effect? For the answers to these and other pressing questions, you could do worse than look to the sublime mayhem of Sam Lipsyte’s new story collection, “The Fun Parts.” Lipsyte expertly works the line between hilarity and pathos, presenting characters who stay airborne only so long as they’re pedaling their rattletrap fantasy machines. The fun is watching how earnestly and furiously they pedal, their legs cranking faster and faster even as their fantasies roll into their final dives."
Up Front,2013-03-01,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Andrew Solomon, who reviews Emily Bazelon’s “Sticks and Stones” this week, remembers some harrowing trips to school when he was a child.","Andrew Solomon, who reviews Emily Bazelon’s “Sticks and Stones” in this week’s issue, remembers some harrowing trips to school when he was a child. “I didn’t tell any adults about being bullied on the school bus, where it was at its violent worst,” he told us by e-mail. “I was afraid that they would somehow see why I was being bullied, that it had something to do with the shameful, damaged, wrong side of me — the gay side.” When his mother eventually learned about the bullying from someone else, she arranged to have a chaperon on the bus. This chaperon “was ineffectual,” Solomon recalled. “While I consistently found adults sympathetic, I didn’t see how they could fix the problem — and neither did they. It felt to me like the weather.”"

Denver is at least the seventh veteran of the SEALs to place a book on the list since Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011; he follows Eric Greitens, Howard Wasdin, Chuck Pfarrer, Chris Kyle (who’s back at No. 1 after his death at a Texas shooting range earlier this year), Marcus Luttrell and Mark Owen (currently at No. 9).

Invasions of Space,2013-03-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A novel of Israelis and Palestinians looks to the days when there was an intimacy to the violence.,"Well into the 1990s, tens of thousands of Palestinians worked in Israel and thousands of Israelis headed to West Bank towns to shop and get their cars fixed. It was the era before proliferating barriers and checkpoints and Arab satellite stations. Palestinians watched Israeli television and understood Hebrew. If a Palestinian worker’s son was getting married, he might well invite an Israeli colleague or boss — and that Israeli might well attend. The relationships were in some sense colonial, hardly between equals. But they were real. Each side was forced to face the fact that on the other were human beings with legitimate concerns, not merely enemies to be feared and despised. There was a surprising, even poignant, intimacy to the conflict, something unimaginable today."
The Iran Syndrome,2013-03-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'United States International Relations']",Two analysts believe that United States policy in Iran should emulate the opening to China.,"There is much to be said for understanding how the Islamic Republic of Iran sees itself on the international stage. We make little sense of history, and less progress toward resolving our conflicts, when we demonize our adversary and ascribe to him dark motives and irrational thoughts. Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett, veterans of the State Department and the National Security Council, might have written a book that made a powerful case for empathy in foreign policy. They would have devoted much of it to illuminating Iran’s strategic interests and its view of history. They might have done so while observing, as they have elsewhere, that American policy must not be blinded by sentimentality about Iranian human rights and democratic aspirations — concerns, they could suggest, that have no place in the cold calculus of global strategy. Whatever we think of the Islamic Republic, the Leveretts might argue, it is the policy maker’s job to understand it as it is, not as he would like it to be. "

Custody Flight,2013-03-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"The protagonist of Amity Gaige’s novel, worried about an impending divorce, takes off on a road trip with his daughter.","Fiction is all about experimental selves, so it’s not hard to see what drew Amity Gaige to the title character of her third novel, “Schroder.” In his grim urban youth, Erik Schroder picks up a summer camp brochure in his pediatrician’s office and is so smitten by the photographs of fearless, handsome boys leading an outdoorsy life that he concocts a fallen-aristocrat persona in order to apply for a scholarship. Rebranding himself as Eric Kennedy, he invents a personal history (in which he was born and raised in a small town “not far from Hyannis Port”) that does much more than get him into Camp Ossipee. It opens so many other social doors that he never really drops the pretense: he goes on to college, gets a job, marries and fathers a child, all as Eric Kennedy."
The Daily Round,2013-03-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",Wide-ranging essays and a writer’s guide from Phillip Lopate.,"The personal essay has always been a stepchild of serious literature, seemingly formless, hard to classify. Lacking the tight construction of a short story or the narrative arc of a novel or memoir, such essays have given readers pleasure without winning cultural respect. Written in a minor key, they could be slight and superficial, but their drawbacks could also be strengths. The style of the first-person essay tends to be conversational, tentative — in tune with our postmodern skepticism about absolutes, the trust we place in multiple perspectives. Few writers have pursued this more resourcefully than Phillip Lopate, who started out as a novelist and poet but gained traction when he began writing lively first-person essays in the late 1970s, later editing a landmark anthology, “The Art of the Personal Essay” (1994). "

He delivered this radio address in the belief that the actions of his government, thus far described only in the jargon of banking and law, “ought to be explained for the benefit of the average citizen.” He had three more chats that year, and two the following year. They played a crucial role in bringing the public with him as his government helped lead the economy out of the Great Depression. "
A Good Look at Herself,2013-03-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In these intertwined essays, Cynthia Zarin reflects on love, work and the surprises of time’s passing.","“An Enlarged Heart” is a collection of personal essays written mostly over the past decade by the poet Cynthia Zarin. I assume the book is labeled a “personal history” for the same reason that collections of short stories are sometimes called “linked stories” or even “novels in stories,” which is that the reading public apparently prefers unified, book-length narratives to such hodgepodge. This is a superficial point, and the packaging decision was almost certainly out of Zarin’s hands, but I mention it up front for a couple of reasons."

Order by the Sword,2013-03-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The discovery of a long-lost manuscript reveals the fate of an ancient German kingdom in Caleb Carr’s epic fantasy.,"It’s unfortunate for Caleb Carr that the craft of writing so often disobeys a beloved American maxim: Hard work pays off. The colossal effort Carr has exerted to produce his latest book, “The Legend of Broken,” weighs distressingly on each of the novel’s 734 pages, including nearly 80 pages of endnotes. This is a fantasy epic — the tale of a fabled Germanic kingdom that rose and fell during the Dark Ages — but with its convoluted prose, its trudging plot and its onslaught of unsurprising period detail, it’s a perverted one. Sweat drips from the pages. Magic does not rise."
Three Sisters,2013-03-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Siblings chafe against their assigned family roles in Lucinda Rosenfeld’s novel.,"Lucinda Rosenfeld’s novels are often praised for getting real. The women she usually writes about have a snide streak that Rosenfeld’s own sardonic tone amplifies, and the situations they face are less affirming than the books’ chick lit packaging would suggest. “What She Saw . . . ” (2000) reminds us that suburban girls from loving families can grow up to be lost and self-hating, and that being desirable to men isn’t a very satisfying end in itself. “Why She Went Home” (2004) explains that it isn’t easy to make it in New York City. “I’m So Happy for You” (2009) — didactically labeled “a novel about best friends” — points out that female friendship can be undermining and hateful. Rosenfeld’s fourth and latest novel, “The Pretty One,” levies more cold truths."

The death of the boy, Max Alan Shatto, prompted outrage in Russia, which late last year banned adoptions by American citizens. Russian leaders had accused the boy’s adoptive mother of fatally beating him. Two Ector County officials — Sheriff Mark Donaldson and District Attorney Bobby Bland — said that after an autopsy, the medical examiner had ruled that Max’s death was accidental. They said that he had been treated for a behavioral disorder that caused him to injure himself and that the bruising that had been found on his body was consistent with the kind of self-injury associated with the disorder. The boy’s adoptive mother, Laura Shatto, told investigators that she had left Max and his brother playing outside unattended and returned to find Max lying on the ground, unresponsive. He died later that day at a hospital. The United States Embassy in Moscow called the boy’s death a tragedy, but added that Texas officials “worked diligently and professionally to examine the evidence concerning Max’s death.” "

What’s on Sunday,2013-03-03,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (History) THE BIBLE Mark Burnett, the reality television impresario, and his wife, the actress Roma Downey, tackle great biblical moments in this 10-hour mini-series, which Neil Genzlinger, writing in The New York Times, called “a rickety, often cheesy spectacle that is calculated to play well to a certain segment of the already enlisted choir but risks being ignored or scorned in other quarters.” Ms. Downey leads the cast, which also includes Diogo Morgaldo as Jesus, above center, being baptized by John (Daniel Percival). Alas, “Abraham, Moses, David, Daniel and the other great biblical figures aren’t really developed in a way that illuminates them or makes them linger in our minds,” Mr. Genzlinger said. “And those thinking that the ancient miracles might be better served by the special effects available in 2013 than they have been in previous versions should prepare for disappointment. The Red Sea parts no more convincingly here than it did for Charlton Heston in 1956.” (“All-Star Celebrity Apprentice,” of which Mr. Burnett is an executive producer, has its season premiere on NBC at 9.) “Vikings,” making its premiere at 10, fares somewhat better in Mr. Genzlinger’s opinion. It is “a mini-series about a band of professional pillagers with a disregard for human life and a relentless focus on gratifying material desires,” he wrote. “So it is somewhat surprising that it is also a refreshing study in restraint.” Created by Michael Hirst, whose previous projects include “Camelot,” on Starz, and “The Tudors,” on Showtime, “it has the same relatively high production values,” and “sometimes the cinematography is downright arresting,” he said. “But what really drives the series are the performances”; he cited in particular Travis Fimmel, Gabriel Byrne and Gustaf Skarsgard."

Noomi Rapace, above with Mr. Nyqvist, is Lisbeth Salander, the vulnerable yet ruthlessly competent computer hacker who helps him solve the mystery in this original Swedish film adaptation of the Stieg Larsson novel, directed by Niels Arden Oplev. “Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler, with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout that’s mostly pucker, she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “She more or less looks the part that the filmmakers don’t let her fully play.” Ms. Dargis added: “ ‘The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo’ was originally published as ‘Men Who Hate Women,’ which apparently wasn’t sexy enough for English-language bookshelves. The title change certainly spices things up, no matter how commonplace body art is, at least outside of Stockholm, and it plays down its overarching theme, which the movie only does further. Just as significant is the substitution in the title of ‘girl’ for ‘women,’ a categorical displacement (and diminution) that also shifts the emphasis from the crime (and criminals) and places it on Salander’s slender back. It’s an attractive back in the movie, as is the tattoo adorning it, even if, like all the prettily photographed winter landscapes, the dragon covers up something the filmmakers seem loath to reveal and simultaneously eager to exploit.”"

She made all of Tessa’s food from scratch, including safe treats to bring to birthday parties, when she could persuade her daughter to attend them at all.

The Terror Loophole,2013-03-07,article,News,,"['Gun Control', 'Terrorism']",Why are people on the F.B.I.’s terrorist watch list legally entitled to buy guns?,"The law that requires background checks on gun buyers is full of loopholes, some big and some small, but the most egregious loophole of all may be the fact that people on the F.B.I.’s terrorist watch list are legally entitled to buy firearms and explosives. And they have been doing so at an alarming rate. Between February 2004 and December 2010, individuals whose names turned up on the list were cleared to purchase firearms or explosives a total of 1,321 times, according to the General Accounting Office. Felons, illegal immigrants and mentally ill applicants are barred on the obvious grounds that they could present a heightened risk of violence. Not so, terrorist suspects — an anomaly that congress has occasionally tsk-tsked over since the 9/11 atrocities, but done nothing substantial to repair.Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has reintroduced a worthy measure to close this “terror gap”— eight years after his initial attempt failed. It would give the Attorney General authority to stop a firearm or explosive sale when a background check reveals the buyer is a known or suspected terrorist who the Attorney General reasonably believes may be planning mayhem. The National Rifle Association opposed the measure in the past because the terrorist watch list has been shown to contain errors. That’s hardly a justification for extending carte blanche to terrorist suspects. Besides, the Lautenberg bill includes written guidelines and due process safeguards that would permit individuals to challenge denials. There’s really no good reason for inaction, unless of course fear of the gun lobby counts as an excuse."

Born-Again Virgins,2013-03-07,article,News,,['Music'],"The Virgins’ newest album will be released on Cult Records, which is run by Julian Casablancas of the Strokes.","It’s pretty neat to be the first act with an album out on a brand-new record label, but even more momentous when that label — in this case, Cult Records — is run by Julian Casablancas, of the Strokes. While lead singer Donald Cumming isn’t shying away from whatever halo effect that may cast on the Virgins‘ “Strike Gently,” which will be released March 12, mostly he’s excited to have the blessing of a fellow musician who understands both sides of the mixing board. “We all played the songs in the studio together,” Cumming said of the band. “You can really hear our instruments bleeding over each other.” The organic quality here lies in considerable contrast to the Virgins’ self-titled 2008 debut, whose rock ‘n’ roll was produced to within inches of bubble-gum pop on tracks like “Rich Girls” and “One Week of Danger.” Their new material is stripped down, a harmonic rumble of moonlight swagger and blue-rose tattoos. “I never aspired to hear someone sing my lyrics on ‘American Idol,'” Cumming explained. “I just wanted to make music that felt authentic to me.” Indeed, a lot has changed in the intervening five years: Cumming is the only original member left in the group; he’s married now, to the artist Aurel Schmidt; and he even taught himself to play the piano (think Schroeder from Peanuts, but with a Brechtian twist). “I don’t like to practice too much,” he admitted. “I like the discoveries I make to sound fresh.”"

At its heart are two orphan girls — one dark, one fair — whose destinies are entwined even as their paths in life have diverged. One of them has fallen under a malign and powerful spell, or maybe both of them have. "

Dehumanized Souls Packing Noir Weapons,2013-03-07,article,Review,,['Movies'],"In “Dead Man Down,” a thug with a secret past squares off with a disfigured woman seeking revenge for an attack.","One of the pleasures of movie watching is the suspension of disbelief. Yet while you can be fully absorbed in a movie, unless you’re a child or certifiable, you never actually put aside your belief in the real world — you just happily agree to go along with the fictional flow. Some directors never spin their lies successfully enough for this to happen, while others blow it with anachronisms, miscasting, shoddy filmmaking, dumb choices or merely a solitary false note. Other movies lose you, only to reel you back in tentatively with a jolt of intelligence or an image that sticks."

Life magazine described the product as “a lure fish can’t pass up.” Desperate to obtain the lures, anglers in America hunted for a way to buy them, usually with no luck.

Inside the List,2013-03-08,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Fifty years ago, the Book Review was shuttered during a four-month newspaper strike — but the best-seller list rolled on.","STRIKE I: Fifty years ago this week, there was no New York Times Book Review — there was, indeed, no proper New York Times at all, as the 1963 newspaper strike was limping to the end of its four-month run. When the Book Review returned on April 7 of that year, its front cover featured a cartoon of a despondent bearded man slumped in an armchair, his concerned wife soothing him: “Cheer up, Harry. You’re not the only author who came out during the strike.” And he wasn’t: the first quarter of 1963 saw the arrival of big books from Günter Grass (“The Tin Drum”), Betty Friedan (“The Feminine Mystique”), Anthony Burgess (“A Clockwork Orange”) and Alexander Solzhenitsyn (“One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich”), among many others. The Book Review did what it could to catch up — all four of those books received respectful reviews in the April 7 issue, and both “The Tin Drum” and “The Feminine Mystique” went on to become hardcover best sellers. But Burgess and Solzhenitsyn had to defer their gratification. “A Clockwork Orange” finally turned up on the paperback fiction list in 1972, after Stanley Kubrick had turned it into a hit movie. And Solzhenitsyn (like Grass) eventually won the Nobel Prize in Literature."

You’re Special,2013-03-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Three picture books explore the theme of individuality.,"How odd, I sometimes think, that so many picture books aimed at our youngest readers emphasize the same theme. “You are special,” they inform us in voices loud and soft. “Celebrate your individuality, your uniqueness, your youness!” The message is a fine one, I suppose, but I can’t help wondering if the constant refrain contains a wee bit of adult projection.

Love Knots,2013-03-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"On a trans-Atlantic cruise, a former psychic examines the tricky deceptions of magic, relationships and language itself.","We don’t, in America, have any writers quite like the Scottish novelist A. L. Kennedy. Her nearest local relative, perhaps, is Richard Ford in his Bascombe novels, with that funny, dark, vituperative voice that serves equally well for tragic and comic moments. Ford, though, possesses an underlying conviction about continuity — of character, of place, of history — while in Kennedy’s world everything is up for grabs, all the time. One might view her work as surreal, if that didn’t imply a divorce from our own felt reality; one might call her sensibility ironic, except she’s profoundly attached to what she describes. Kennedy’s novels repeatedly take on dark subjects (alcoholism, familial despair, sexual betrayal, loneliness), but they do so in a chatty, engaging manner that can sometimes make you laugh out loud. I wasn’t surprised to learn that she has a sideline as a stand-up comic — though, again, this isn’t something a serious American novelist would do. And A. L. Kennedy is as serious as they get."

The Legitimizing of Rand Paul,2013-03-11,article,News,,[],Why the right’s reaction to his filibuster matters to the Republican foreign policy debate.,"My Sunday column argues that the great Rand Paul filibuster represented an important step in the Kentucky Senator’s quest to widen the Republican conversation on national security beyond the “strength good, appeasement bad” rhetoric that the party had fallen back on (though not as completely as some Republicans would like) in the aftermath of the Bush presidency. The most persuasive counterpoint to my interpretation is that the right’s rally around Paul’s drones-on-American-soil stand is sui generis, with no wider implications for the G.O.P. foreign policy debates: Many of the Republican Party’s hawks have always been skeptical of drone warfare (preferring boots on the ground, more prisoner-taking, etc.), and the fact that Paul was making a reductio ad hellfirum argument about drones taking down latter-day Jane Fondas made it that much easier for them to leap on the partisan bandwagon and #standwithRand."

The ruling Friday, by Judge A. Wallace Tashima of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, came in a lawsuit brought by teachers and students at the Tucson Unified School District against Arizona’s school superintendent, John Huppenthal, and other state officials.

The law, signed in 2010, prohibits public schools from offering courses that promote the overthrow of the United States government, advocate ethnic solidarity and foster resentment toward a race or class of people. In Tucson, students studied history and literature from a Mexican-American perspective. Opponents said the curriculum encouraged students to resent white people.

Mr. Obama Goes to Israel,2013-03-13,article,Op-Ed,,"['Palestinians', 'United States International Relations', 'Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline', 'Israeli Settlements']",Here are a few questions the president might ask on his visit to Israel next week.,"In case you haven’t heard, President Obama leaves for Israel next week. It is possible, though, that you haven’t heard because it is hard for me to recall a less-anticipated trip to Israel by an American president. But there is a message in that empty bottle: Little is expected from this trip — not only because little is possible, but because, from a narrow U.S. point of view, little is necessary. Quietly, with nobody announcing it, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted from a necessity to a hobby for American diplomats. Like any hobby — building model airplanes or knitting sweaters — some days you work on it, some days you don’t. It depends on your mood, but it doesn’t usually matter when that sweater gets finished. Obama worked on this hobby early in his first term. He got stuck as both parties rebuffed him, and, therefore, he adopted, quite rationally in my view, an attitude of benign neglect. It was barely noticed."

But experience itself is a subjective reality that seems to elude the objectivity of scientific understanding. We know that our experiences—of seeing red, feeling pain, falling in love and so forth—depend on physical systems like the brain that science can, in principle, exhaustively explain. But it’s hard to make sense of the idea that experiences themselves could be physical. No doubt experiences correlate with objective physical facts, but, as subjective phenomena, how could they be such facts? When I feel intense pain, scientists may be able to observe brain-events that cause my pain, but they cannot observe the very pain that I feel. What science can observe is public and objective; what I feel is private and subjective."

Out of Time: The Sins of Immediacy,2013-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In “Present Shock,” Douglas Rushkoff analyzes the breathless impact of today’s technologies, including their consequences for information processing.","“Present Shock” is one of those invaluable books that make sense of what we already half-know. Playing on the title of Alvin Toffler’s influential 1970 “Future Shock,” which sounded an alarm about what Mr. Toffler called “a personal perception of too much change in too short a period of time,” Douglas Rushkoff analyzes a very different phenomenon. The future arrived a little while ago, he posits — maybe with Y2K, maybe with Sept. 11. Now it’s here. And we are stuck with “a diminishment of everything that isn’t happening right now — and the onslaught of everything that supposedly is.” Mr. Toffler warned that we would be unready for this onslaught. Mr. Rushkoff is more analytical than alarmist. He divides his thoughts into five sections addressing five kinds of profound change, and his biggest illustration of present shock has to do with the actual book itself. Because the present is more full of interruptions than the past was, it took him extra time to write. Because its ideas aren’t glib, he says, “here I am writing opera when the people are listening to singles.” And he realizes that data-swamped readers may take longer to finish books now. Coming from him the phrase “thanks for your time” has new meaning."

Carson told me that, years ago, she had a bad experience with the private-detective model of journalism and would prefer never to do it again. It took her publisher a couple of weeks to wear her down to the point that she would agree, even in a limited way, to participate in a profile.

Pen Pals,2013-03-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A collection of letters between Paul Auster and J. M. Coetzee, in which the writers attempt to “strike sparks off each other.”","It’s an odd moment for literary letters as a genre. The proliferation of letter volumes published over the past few years (Beckett, Bellow, Wodehouse, Gaddis, with Calvino and Wallace on the way) might be considered post-mortem in more ways than one, putting to bed a form that is already effectively dead, along with its authors. For while the ­e-­revolution means changes in how we read any sort of book, the move from epistles to ­e-­pistles is, for better or worse, a fundamental redefinition of the genre itself. And while there are probably plenty of contemporary writers saving up their best e-mails on external hard drives for later publication, it’s difficult to imagine those looking or acting like a volume of letters. Since you will read these collected e-mails on your electronic device, there’s a fairly good chance they will look like, well, your in-box."
True Lies,2013-03-15,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Forget fictionalized memoirs. More troubling are the countless novels tainted by elements of truth.,"In January, two California men, a political consultant and a professional chef, filed suit against Lance Armstrong and his publishers after his interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which he confessed to blood doping and using other performance-enhancing drugs during his Tour de France championship spree. In their complaint, the litigants claimed they would not have purchased Armstrong’s autobiographies “It’s Not About the Bike” (2000) and “Every Second Counts” (2003) had they known that the books were built on a foundation of lies. Any inspirational messages contained within, they alleged, were communicated with a flagrant disregard for truth. Armstrong’s stories of training vigilantly and succeeding as a result grossly misrepresented actual circumstance. Moreover, the lawsuit suggested, the two books were categorically dishonest: they were marketed as nonfiction when they were, it turns out, fictitious."
Requiem,2013-03-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this memoir, Emily Rapp describes the months after learning of her young son’s fatal genetic disorder.","The “grief memoir” is by now a well-established subgenre of autobiography, the array of recent books about dead loved ones a veritable graveyard. The best of these — Jamaica Kincaid’s “My Brother” and Peter Handke’s “Sorrow Beyond Dreams” — aren’t just sad stories; they’re attempts to write one’s way out of the crisis. So it is with Emily Rapp’s “Still Point of the Turning World,” a memoir in which a mother’s grief occasions a brilliant study of the wages of mortal love."

Inside the List,2013-03-15,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Pat Summitt, the renowned women’s basketball coach who won eight national championships at the University of Tennessee, is now a No. 1 best-selling author, with the memoir “Sum It Up.”","A FISH CALLED GENO: Pat Summitt, the renowned women’s basketball coach from the University of Tennessee, is used to being No. 1: with 1,098 career victories, eight national championships and a win-loss ratio of .840, she is by some measures the most successful coach in N.C.A.A. history. So it makes a poetic kind of sense that her memoir — the wincingly titled “Sum It Up,” written with Sally Jenkins — would shoot straight to the top in its first week on the hardcover nonfiction list. The book is tumultuous and engaging (“one long roar of acceleration,” as Summitt describes her undefeated 1997-98 season), and unafraid to throw a good-natured elbow or two."

Full House,2013-03-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A summer home both shelters and isolates the family in Elizabeth Graver’s multigenerational novel.,"Late in Elizabeth Graver’s eloquent new novel, a therapist warns a very troubled young man against what he calls the “geographic” cure: “You can’t fix yourself by going somewhere else. . . . You’ll always take yourself along.” The young man, convinced that his family’s summer home on the coast of Massachusetts is the only place he has ever been happy, instantly bristles. “Ashaunt,” Charlie insists, isn’t “somewhere else.” By now, having occupied this windswept spit of land along with the Porters from World War II through Vietnam, Graver’s readers will be inclined to agree. It is indeed special, sometimes almost magical. But we also realize, having come to know the other lives entangled with Charlie’s, that Ashaunt’s spell can involve something much more complex than a dearly held childhood attachment, that a house like this, where “everyone could be together and so tight,” can also feel “vise tight, tight enough to blow a fuse.” The therapist may be right. Wherever they go, Graver’s characters will carry Ashaunt along, but its look and feel will be different for each of them, colored by the emotions they inhabit just as intimately as they do its drafty rooms and sandy footpaths."
Jump-Cuts,2013-03-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Renata Adler’s reissued novels, vignette follows vignette.","There was a time when her name would provoke admiration, anger and, not infrequently, fear. Renata Adler was a purveyor of definitive judgments, of arguments that seemed to march inexorably from a firmly held point of view. In the late ’60s, during a 14-month stint as a film critic for The New York Times, she eviscerated a good deal of what Hollywood had to offer. (Her loathing for John Wayne’s hyper-­patriotic “Green Berets” — “so unspeakable, so stupid, so rotten and false in every detail” — was entered into the Congressional Record by Strom Thurmond, who cited it as definitive proof “that this must be one of the most admirable movies of our generation.”) In 1980, she wrote an 8,000-word essay in The New York Review of Books that denounced the work of Pauline Kael as “piece by piece, line by line, and without interruption, worthless.” Throughout it all, she was a writer for The New Yorker, and her memoir of nearly 30 years there was similarly unsparing, showing that her category of “old friend” wasn’t necessarily distinct from that of “fair game.” She seemed dissatisfied with merely cutting something down to size; whatever offended her had to be put out of its miserable existence, and she wielded her hatchet with methodical and merciless strokes."

Arista Cat,2013-03-15,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Music']",Clive Davis reviews his career as a hit-maker.,"No mere vulgar showbiz reminiscence — and that’s kind of a pity — Clive Davis’s autobiography has the ceremonious heft we associate with presidential memoirs. At 586 dense pages, “The Soundtrack of My Life” is dwarfed by Bill Clinton’s herculean “My Life.” But it leaves the shrimpy 497 pages of George W. Bush’s “Decision Points” looking like an amuse-bouche. "
Five Easy Pieces,2013-03-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Two novellas, three stories, shared memories.","Sebastian Faulks’s “novel in five parts” isn’t really a novel — any more than Gertrude Stein’s “Three Lives” is a novel or, indeed, the book that inspired Stein’s, Flaubert’s splendid “Three Tales.” “A Possible Life” consists of three short stories, bookended by two novellas, each set, like Flaubert’s, in a different place and historical period. Indeed, Faulks’s story “Jeanne” is a retelling of the Flaubert tale “A Simple Heart,” but without the parrot."
Carnal Knowledge,2013-03-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Lucy Ellmann’s novel follows the romantic escapades of a New York plastic surgeon who discovers his inner feminist.,"Lucy Ellmann’s sixth novel, “Mimi,” starts off promisingly, and there are passages that mark her as a talented and erudite writer. But that Ellmann appears to share a word processor with another Lucy Ellmann, who insists on aggressively cloying tics: exclamation marks, Capital Letters and italics. She deploys these mannerisms with such remorseless, in-your-face frequency that the reader is left wondering whether Ellmann is attempting some elusive gestalt. Elusive, that is, unless gestalt also means “self-indulgent” in German."
A Woman of Importance,2013-03-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Constance Wilde was more than just a long-suffering wife.,"No one was ever more suitably named, at birth and by marriage, than Constance Wilde. Her first name conveys her near-endless loyalty to her irresponsible, genius husband, Oscar. Even after the worst of the humiliations — after he had taken up with the pretty young Lord Alfred Douglas and been sent to prison for the affair, after her household goods had been auctioned to pay the high-living Oscar’s debts, after she had fled to the Continent and changed the family name to protect their two small sons — she could still refer to him as a “poor, poor fellow” and write in a letter, “What a tragedy for him who is so gifted!”"
Lost Letters,2013-03-15,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Handwriting']",Philip Hensher on the fading art of writing longhand.,"In an era when the comment “You’re all thumbs” can be taken as high praise of texting prowess, the notion of hand writing a note, a business letter or even a grocery list seems quaint — like studying elocution or fastening shoes with mother-of-pearl buttons. Bemoaning the decline of the written hand smacks of fogyism, but the British novelist Philip Hensher, who is also a columnist for The Independent and an arts critic for The Spectator, enlivens his musings about penmanship’s demise with sharp insights and wry wit. In “The Missing Ink,” he argues that handwriting fills a human need: “It involves us in a relationship with the written word which is sensuous, immediate and individual. It opens our personality out to the world, and gives us a means of reading other people.”"

He has run across entire landmasses­ (Corsica) and mountain ranges (the Pyrenees), nearly without pause. He regularly runs all day eating only wild berries and drinking only from streams. On summer mornings he will set off from his apartment door at the foot of Mont Blanc and run nearly two and a half vertical miles up to Europe’s roof — over cracked glaciers, past Gore-Tex’d climbers, into the thin air at 15,781 feet — and back home again in less than seven hours, a trip that mountaineers can spend days to complete. A few years ago Jornet ran the 165-mile Tahoe Rim Trail and stopped just twice to sleep on the ground for a total of about 90 minutes. In the middle of the night he took a wrong turn, which added perhaps six miles to his run. He still finished in 38 hours 32 minutes, beating the record of Tim Twietmeyer, a legend in the world of ultrarunning, by more than seven hours. When he reached the finish line, he looked as if he’d just won the local turkey trot."

He fixes a skim-milk cappuccino with two shots of espresso, eats a banana and then sits down in his home office, where the walls are decorated with autographed scores by Verdi, Puccini and Shostakovich and the shelves are filled with hundreds of CDs, including some by his great-uncle, the renowned violinist Jascha Heifetz.

The Corpse in the Bedroom,2013-03-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Many of the stories in this collection pursue the theme of infidelity.,"First story collections, even good ones, tend to fall into two broad categories. On the one hand, there is the energetic but diffuse hodgepodge, the result, perhaps, of an eager mind fussing with the newly discovered tools of literary culture. Such books often contain a few terrific stories interspersed with failed experiments. On the other hand is the imitative, overly mannered matched set, wherein the author behaves like a traveler in a new country, trying to do as the natives do. Such a book may be skillfully made, but can feel staid or too careful."

Justin Timberlake Keeps it Retro,2013-03-21,article,News,,['Music'],Timberlake’s latest album delivers its artistry through its familiarity.,"In pop music, hindsight is the key to relevance. There is the Warholian logic to the iTunes chart: the artist who appropriates a particular time period with the most cunning and skill feels the freshest. The Los Angeles-based musical duo Rhye have received critical acclaim recently for evoking the early-‘80s-era “quiet storm” of Sade. Azealia Banks channels the 1990s with her best Crystal Waters imitation with about the same success as Lady Gaga’s echoing of Blond Ambition-era Madonna. (Remember that?) The moody atmosphere of Drake’s oeuvre picks up the pieces that Aaliyah left behind in 2001. And the dance-pop white noise that inhabits the radio today is, of course, a rehash of the Euro-pop and rave culture of yesteryear that Daft Punk helped foster. The French D.J. duo, who recently signed to Columbia and have a new album coming out in time for summer, are said to be working with the funk legend Niles Rodgers for their anticipated new release, situating themselves comfortably in the 1970s disco revival moment that has become a staple of underground night-life culture in Paris, London and New York."

She called it “Mountains and Sea,” and it became her best-known, most influential work. Its bounding scale, skirmish of pastel colors and charcoal lines, and mixture of landscape, still life and abstraction were distinctive. But most important was the way it fused color and canvas into a new, streamlined unity. Frankenthaler’s stain painting method, as it was sometimes called, was considered a breakthrough in many circles, the gateway to what would become Color Field abstraction. "

Late Marriage and Its Consequences,2013-03-22,article,News,,[],"Winners, losers, and complexities in a world of steadily-later marriage.","On Wednesday I had the privilege of joining a Brookings Institution event organized around the new report “Knot Yet: The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage,” which tries to tease out the social implications of the steadily rising age of first marriage — now at 27 for women and 29 for men, both historic highs. Not surprisingly, a lot of the discussion focused on the impact of this trend on children, because the story of late marriage is entangled with the story of rising out-of-wedlock births, thanks to what the authors call “the great crossover” — the fact that the age of first marriage, which was once about a year earlier than the average age at which the first child was born, now lags the average age of first birth by about a year. Hence the report’s most attention-grabbing statistic: That 48 percent of overall first births, and 58 percent of first births to what the report calls “Middle Americans” — women with a high school diploma and maybe some college, but no 4-year degree — now take place outside of marriage, a trend whose negative consequences for children probably don’t need to be rehearsed here."

Apart from the unfamiliarity of the names on the title pages, not much united these works. There were novels, story collections, memoirs of food and art and unimaginable suffering. Their authors represented a range of backgrounds and sensibilities. And “new” didn’t necessarily mean “young” — youth (or age, for that matter) being no indicator of talent. But all the voices were fresh, and all made us sit up a bit straighter before settling in for the journey. Call it an accident of timing, but publishing’s spring crop offers a tangible rebuke to the lament that books are endangered, and suggests that literature’s future is in good hands."

Sandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook, and her book has renewed longstanding debates about the paucity of female executives and the best way to remedy it. (Sandberg’s answer, boiled down, is: “Work harder, girls!”) One sign that the book has touched a nerve is that, along with a steady stream of praise, it is also fielding criticism from across the ideological spectrum. On the one hand, in the “biology is destiny” camp, Christina Hoff Sommers recently charged in The Atlantic that Sandberg was “mired in 1970s-style feminism” with her earnest calls for “consciousness-raising groups” and her desire to “liberate her fellow Americans from the stereotypes of gender.” What if those stereotypes are innate, Sommers wondered, and women just aren’t interested in high-powered careers? “In the pursuit of happiness,” she wrote, “men and women often take different paths.”"

It’s one of the strongest (and funniest) in the collection, no small feat in our zombie-saturated cultural landscape. It also, in its way, sums up the central struggle of many of Gonzales’s characters: When does one just sit by, and when do darker impulses bubble up and take over? When do we stand aside, and when do we act? These stories vary widely — an elegiac description of a plane circling Dallas for decades, a futuristic wake mourning the loss of Africa into the ocean, social science “reportage” about false anthropological claims — but they work best when the characters, for whatever reasons, succumb to a buried darkness. Inner zombie rises up. "

‘To Talk to You in Letters’,2013-03-22,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This epistolary novel about two writers is based on the correspondence of Flannery O’Connor and Robert Lowell.,"With enough distance, it’s possible to be nostalgic about pretty much anything, even the gray-flannel decade the poet Robert Lowell, who spent part of it on Thorazine, called the “tranquilized ’50s.” Ah, for the days of “duck and cover,” “The Pajama Game” and “I Like Ike.” Now Carlene Bauer, author of a precocious memoir, “Not That Kind of Girl,” about growing up evangelical in a secular age, has dug into the dawn of the “Mad Men” era for her first novel, about two young writers on the rise who meet at an artists’ colony modeled on Yaddo during the summer of 1957."
Saucy Dishes,2013-03-22,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Cooking and Cookbooks']","In his memoir, the chef Eddie Huang writes about his family, his love of hip-hop and his efforts to perfect red cooked skirt steak.","Hold the presses! Not all Asian-Americans are studying math and practicing the piano. Some, like the young Eddie Huang, are busy shoplifting CDs, taking Ecstasy and getting thrown in the clink. Huang’s rambunctious memoir boasts many classic adolescent moments — the employment of a SPAM launcher, for example, and the inevitable arrival of a Miss Lacey on the scene. There are tussles with his parents, tussles with his peers. There are cops and drugs. And of course, channeling his inner Holden Caulfield involves, well, language: "
Everything in Its Path,2013-03-22,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this novel, a couple escape the devastation wrought by a tornado — for which their community destroys them.","Just before 1 o’clock on the afternoon of March 18, 1925, over the farmland of southeastern Missouri, a column of air, spinning like a skater with her arms folded, came down from the clouds and touched ground. To prevent public panic, the word “tornado” had been officially banned from United States weather forecasts since 1887, so the regional forecast called only for rain and shifting winds. It was possibly the greatest understatement in the history of meteorology."
A Feast for the Senses,2013-03-22,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Tamara Shopsin — graphic designer, illustrator, short-order cook — chronicles a year of travel, work and misfortune.","I’ve managed to eat at Kenny Shopsin’s legendary restaurant and ­customer-hazing clinic only once, thanks to a regular who had passed muster and brought me along to breakfast. This was when Shopsin’s was still in Greenwich Village and felt like a crazed version of the general store it had once been; over the stack of plain pancakes that I ordered without knowing any better, I tried not to be too alarmed by the abusive banter in the kitchen between Shopsin and one of his sons — which sounded, to the uninitiated, like a job for 911. Could I call social services, I wondered, and still come back for more pancakes? "
Beautiful Losers,2013-03-22,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The characters in Jim Gavin’s stories live in run-down Los Angeles neighborhoods and are the sons of journeymen and salesmen.,"A generous humanity and a fond wit animate Jim Gavin’s wonderful first collection, “Middle Men.” Gavin’s stories revolve around a familiar theme — men searching for identity and meaning — but they’re distinguished by his more specific concerns: how work shapes lives, and the differences in the way the young and the old confront the humbling problem of ambition and success. Gavin’s characters, most of whom live in down-at-the-heels neighborhoods of Los Angeles or in modest industrial towns south of the city, are sons of journeymen, low-paid assistants and traveling salesmen. These men know, or are beginning to suspect, that the mark they will make on the world is small. But “Middle Men” doesn’t wallow in pessimism; with deft portraiture, nimble prose and an intimacy with the lives of his amiable characters, Gavin shows us that the real work of a life takes place not when the sale is made but when the salesman goes back home, looks in a half-empty refrigerator and considers his options."
Buffalo Noir,2013-03-22,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Stephan Talty makes the city of Buffalo both the locale and a major character in his first thriller, “Black Irish.”","When it comes to great settings for a crime novel, there’s no place like home. For Stephan Talty, that’s Buffalo, which he has made both the locale and a major character in his first thriller, BLACK IRISH (Ballantine, $26). As viewed by Detective Absalom (Abbie) Kearney, lately returned to care for a father whose mind is going, Buffalo is a decaying place, sunk in despair, haunted by its illustrious past. “The whole city was entombed by the artifacts of its glory days,” she observes of the disintegrating waterfront, the bankrupt mills and “silent” smokestacks, the highways built for a population long gone. And nowhere is this sense of loss more keenly felt than in the section where Abbie grew up, “a patch of Ireland in the wilds of America” known as the County."

Swarthout decided to tag along so that he could observe the rituals (pool-hopping, pith helmets, beatnik jazz) and capture the lingo (“beaucoup beers,” “schizoid,” “babyroo”). Upon his return, he dashed off a novel about coeds who cruise the beach and “play house” with boys from other colleges — a 1950s version of “Girls Gone Wild.” In a nod to the Easter season, he called his book “Unholy Spring,” but Hollywood executives persuaded him to change the title to “Where the Boys Are.” The result was a blockbuster book that was spun off into a movie — marketed with the phrase “spring vacation” — as well as a Connie Francis song."

What’s on Sunday,2013-03-24,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) PHIL SPECTOR (2013) A wigged-out Al Pacino reunites with the writer and director David Mamet (“Glengarry Glen Ross”) to portray the music producer and songwriter charged with the 2003 shooting death of Lana Clarkson inside his home in Alhambra, Calif. Helen Mirren, right with Mr. Pacino, plays the lawyer Linda Kenney Baden, who represented Mr. Spector alongside Bruce Cutler (Jeffrey Tambor) at his first trial, in 2007, which resulted in a hung jury. (He was convicted in 2009 and is serving 19 years to life.) The movie has already set off controversy: Mr. Spector’s wife, Rachelle, has complained about the film’s depiction of her husband as “a foul-mouthed megalomaniac.” Edward Lozzi, a former publicist for Ms. Clarkson, has taken exception to the film’s focus on the defense’s argument that she killed herself. The film is a work of fiction, Mr. Mamet said in an HBO interview, spun from his fascination with Mr. Spector’s character “and the mythological possibilities.” “The focus on the tender and respectful bond between lawyer and client looks a lot like a revisionist re-enactment and maybe even absolution,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “Everyone has a right to the best available defense, but not everyone deserves to be played by the best available actor.”"

My family owns land in northeast Pennsylvania. A portion is owned outright by my mother, who has entered into a contract with a natural-gas company to allow drilling on the property. Royalties from the gas extraction allow her to live comfortably in retirement. My mother made the arrangements for the gas drilling without my support. I’m not in favor of increasing fossil-fuel dependence. In light of the anticipated royalties, my mother was advised by her lawyer to establish a corporate partnership with my brother and me, for liability protection. This would mean a portion of the royalties will be mine. If I intend to work on any future climate-change projects professionally, should I decline the partnership with my mother? If I do not support natural-gas drilling, is that another reason to decline the partnership? And is this decision different from eventually inheriting money related to drilling? RICHARD, WASHINGTON"

The radio in my car was tuned to an NPR show, on which callers were debating the decision by the C.E.O. of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, to ban employees from working from home. I’d been thinking about Mayer since early that morning, having fallen down an Internet rabbit hole that plunged me deep into her art collection, her exclusive wardrobe and her estimated $300 million net worth. Specifically, I was thinking about the rather highhanded, Marie Antoinette-ish way in which she dismissed the need for extended maternity leave, as if it hadn’t occurred to her that building an en suite nursery for her newborn next to her office basically elided the need for it, since the baby could remain within a few feet of her all day long."

Which has only made them that much more compelling.,"The fall of 2000 felt like end times for rock ’n’ roll in New York City. On the radio it was all boy bands and Britney Spears, and there hadn’t been a vital rock scene since punk in the 1970s. But on a Sunday night at a tiny club in Lower Manhattan, something was happening. There were four acts on the bill at the Mercury Lounge; the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the openers, and it was still light out when they took the stage. The band was elemental: guitar and drums, no bass. But the singer, who called herself Karen O, was otherworldly. She was dressed in a kind of “Clockwork Orange” burlesque, with cutout hearts as pasties. Before the show, she doused herself in olive oil. Onstage, she danced around like a lunatic, manically grinning and flinging droplets of oil from her hair into the crowd. The guitar player, Nick Zinner, had seen this side of her. But the drummer, Brian Chase, had practiced with the band only once, and this was their first gig. “The only thing to do,” Chase remembers thinking, “is just be like, ‘Whoa.’ ”"

If cultural appropriation must take place, the thinking goes, then authors should treat black narratives — often the products of American history, and thus as sacred as the Constitution itself — with kid gloves.

Prince of Punk,2013-03-29,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Music']","The rocker and frontman for the Voidoids ruminates on his life, loves and his rift with a collaborator.","Richard Hell was partly responsible for the phenomenon of punk, a visionary whose style Malcolm McLaren imported to England and impressed upon his pet project, the Sex Pistols, who popularized and cashed in on Hell’s spiky hair, torn clothes and audacious attitude — embodied in his seminal record of 1977, “Blank Generation.” In his new autobiography, “I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp,” Hell admits to resenting the Sex Pistols for failing to acknowledge how much they lifted from him. But in a moment that speaks to this punk-icon-turned-accomplished-writer’s commitment to an objective distance from himself, he rhetorically asks, “How many kids were going to get excited about calling themselves ‘blank’? The concept of ‘anarchy’ was just as disgusted and contrary but a lot more fun.”"

President Bill Clinton gave her a Medal of Freedom in 1996; Congress awarded her a Gold Medal in 1999 (passed nearly unanimously — only Representative Ron Paul of Texas dissented); and after her death, her body lay in the Capitol Rotunda. She was the first woman to be so honored, and the first black woman to have a statue in her likeness placed in the National Statuary Hall of the Capitol.

The cliché about the dustbin of history is almost too apt when Alexander Stille walks into his aunt Lally’s apartment. Buried in the stacks of clothes, receipts, lottery tickets and old balls of yarn, there are fantastic photographs, a letter from the proto-Fascist poet Gabriele d’Annunzio and all the living room furniture Lally’s parents had taken with them when the family fled Russia for Italy and then Italy for the United States.

That case, taken together with the 1967 decision In re Gault, which gave juveniles the same rights in court as adults, stands for the principle that process matters in our system of justice; when faced with the awesome power of the state, the accused — rich or poor, old or young — must be properly armed."

By Night in Chile,2013-03-29,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Alejandro Zambra’s novel considers the legacy of Pinochet.,"In a summary, most literary careers nowadays — in New York or Zagreb — can look eerily similar. Take, for instance, the case of Alejandro Zambra. Zambra is a Chilean who has so far written three novels. He was born in 1975, and teaches literature at the Diego Portales University in Santiago. He has figured on Granta’s list of best young Spanish-­language novelists, and the Bogotá39 project. His career, in other words, has the usual global vibe. But if you held his novels in your hand, then something much stranger would be immediately apparent. “Bonsai,” his first, takes up only 86 miniature pages. His second, “The Private Lives of Trees,” requires 98. His third, “Ways of Going Home,” which has just been published in a translation by Megan McDowell, uses a comparatively gargantuan 139. All of them are marked by a uniquely manic brevity."

It is distinct from useful, more rational elements like the psychology of characters, rich details of settings, pungent dialogue, clever plots, memorable images — all remain mechanical unless animated by the pure mastery of “and then,” the mysterious, proliferating other-life of narrative conviction. In the kind of narrative I mean, incidents themselves are prolific. That teeming germ-culture thrives notably in the writing of the Israeli novelist A. B. Yehoshua."
