Is the Art World Too Big for Its Own Good?,2018-06-12,article,News,,['Art'],"Four gallery owners — Paula Cooper, Elyse Derosia, Bridget Donahue and Sean Kelly — discuss art fairs, auctions and staying in business.","Many of the most powerful galleries in the world today — places such as Gagosian, Hauser & Wirth and David Zwirner — got their start in the 1980s and early ’90s. The art world was still fairly small then, concentrated in just a few cities (London, Zurich and Paris among them), but its philosophical and commercial center was a cluster of storefronts in downtown Manhattan. In the years since, and especially in the last decade, the art world has transformed into a global monolith: there are now galleries with hundreds of employees and branches across several continents, businesses that have grown into international corporations overseeing the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars a year (and in some cases more). The industry is now an interconnected network of money and power that includes auction houses, where sales records are broken in a practiced routine that it is both mundane and exhausting, and art fairs, a pure distillation of capitalism in which galleries of all sizes pay large sums of money — thousands for a smaller gallery, usually tens of thousands for a larger one — to operate booths and peddle their wares to collectors (there are now more than 100 big ones all over the world). Art dealers are the entryway into this system, and many of those who began with mere ambitions to discover and financially support artists now must contend with the omnipresent threat of larger galleries, which scoop up those artists once they’ve become commercially successful."

Are they bridging the gap between East and West, and testing the nuances of immigration and exile? Negar Djavadi is, with her story of a family of Iranian emigrants to Paris. Are they a former POTUS collaborating with James Patterson on a political thriller about a rogue president who goes missing in the name of national security?"

What Does Italy Have to Be Proud of Now?,2018-06-14,article,Op-Ed,,"['Politics and Government', 'World Cup (Soccer)', 'Soccer', 'World Cup 2018 (Soccer)', 'Immigration and Emigration']","The only energy left in politics is the energy of national assertion, which Italians will not be able to vent on the soccer field this year.","MILAN — Things can change. In the 37 years that I have been living in Italy, I have watched nine World Cup tournaments. The Italian team was always there. In 1982 and 2006 it won. In 1994, in the United States, it lost the final on penalties to Brazil. In 1990, as host, it crashed out in the semifinals to Argentina. True, on other occasions it failed abjectly in the group stages. True, some years it left qualification for the competition to the very last game. But no one doubted it would win that game. No one doubted that a country that invests so much money and emotional energy in soccer, a country with so much flair, talent and sheer devilish cunning, would come good when it counts. But we were wrong. Italy’s national soccer team is not in Russia for this year’s World Cup. “The worst summer ever for Italian men,” a recent headline in Corriere della Sera declared: no World Cup and nothing to do on the beach but talk politics.

I’d like to say something, but I’m afraid it will only lead to more comments. What do you think?"

Funky Ceramics Are Everywhere. Including in Galleries.,2018-06-14,article,News,,"['Art', 'Ceramics and Pottery', 'Clay', 'Sculpture']",The fine art world has started to embrace works made from clay — a material it once deemed lowly.,"More than sewing, flower-arranging or zine-making, clay might offer the perfect antidote to modern times. Hyper-tactile, it taps into a primal desire to shape earth — what the potter and writer Edmund de Waal has described as thinking through the hands — and is beloved for its immediacy. “You move and the clay moves with you,” says Aneta Regel, who was a finalist for this year’s Loewe Craft Prize and who, 12 years after graduating from London’s Royal College of Arts, now finds her works — lumpy, funky, cooked until cracked — aligned with a prevailing taste for artfully imperfect handwork, more generally, and for all things ceramic, in particular. If it is unsurprising to find mounting evidence of the trend on Instagram and at lifestyle-leaning boutiques like Samuji in New York and CristaSeya in Paris, it is notable that clay’s proliferation has, over the past decade, extended to the fine art world, which has long been wary of the material, widely considered to be lowly, functional and inexpensive. One of de Waal’s early teachers liked to say that his pots “had to be cheap enough to drop,” a condition that recalls the train tracks around Kolkata, India, strewn with shards of terracotta as a result of riders’ tossing their empty cups of chai out the window."

And when did all that mythology come undone, sending classic rock from the cultural penthouse to the funeral parlor?” Below, Mr. Hyden talks about how the Who helped to inspire the book, the connection between music and mortality, and more."

In 2015, U.S. Youth Soccer, the organization that oversees most of the country’s leagues for children and teenagers, announced a ban on heading in games and practices by participants younger than 11, citing concerns that the play might contribute to concussions. In response, some soccer authorities pointed out that young players would be late to learn an essential soccer skill and that concussions from heading are rare in that age group regardless. Now a study presented last month at the annual convention of the American College of Sports Medicine may help quell doubts about the current regulations, which went into effect in 2016."

I resigned myself to a dozen mornings of waking up before dawn and just as many afternoons of finding myself fuzzy-headed at 4 and ready for bed soon after. What I didn’t anticipate were the fierce cravings that struck at all hours. Throughout the days and into some nights, I wanted both what I loved in China and what I missed while I was there. I dreamed of congee drizzled with vinegar, soup dumplings, slurpable noodles, tofu so fragile it wriggled off a spoon.

This past April, he and his girlfriend, Angela Gomez, 27, moved to Manhattan permanently with Dashi, their American Bully. They are now living together in an apartment in NoLIta, with Mr. Cailan’s general manager, Kim Trac, 31, a block away. And in early July, Mr. Cailan will open his first New York restaurant, The Usual, in the Nolitan Hotel, at 30 Kenmare Street. He plans to serve, as he told The Times recently, “the food we all crave,” prepared by “the children of immigrants.”"

Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: A Fresh Look at Benedict Arnold’s Treason,2018-06-24,article,Question,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers', 'Revolutionary War, American (1775-83)']","In “Turncoat,” the independent historian Stephen Brumwell argues that Arnold’s plot to foil the American Revolution was more complicated than it has previously appeared.","Benedict Arnold’s name might be the first that comes to mind when we think of treason not just because he was a traitor, but because he was such an unlikely one. For several years before he attempted to change the course of the American Revolution in 1780 by planning to help the British overtake West Point and capture George Washington, he had exhibited great courage and suffered serious injury for the colonies’ cause. “Within months of accepting command of the Continental Army in June 1775, Washington had realized that Arnold was that prized rarity in an army of amateurs: a born soldier and charismatic leader of men,” Stephen Brumwell writes in his new book, “Turncoat: Benedict Arnold and the Crisis of American Liberty.” Arnold was a soldier after Washington’s “own heart, a tenacious fighter who refused to be discouraged by even the most unfavorable circumstances.” That Arnold betrayed his side is undoubted.

His book starts with dining habits in earlier eras and goes on to provide often acerbic commentary on the scene of his time, when Paris was considered to be the center of the culinary world.

He suggests that “to be happy with the waiter, make sure the waiter is happy with you,” and notes that Parisians tossed their salads with about 500,000 gallons of vinegar a year. He covers the rich, the poor and even hospital food."
