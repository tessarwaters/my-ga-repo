Indeed, this coral archipelago in the Indian Ocean, 23 miles off the eastern coast of Tanzania, still has many of the features that it did when it was an important trading center and its historic Stone Town served as the capital of an Omani sultanate.

In recent years, there’s been a concerted effort to restore and give new life to the city’s distinctive structures. Palaces have been turned into museums and cultural centers, and grand Swahili mansions have been reborn as restaurants and boutique hotels. Yet the coast still offers the “delicious view” that the explorer Sir Richard Burton recorded, of a “cocoa-fringed shore of purest white, and the sea blue as a slab of lapis lazuli.” (Note: Prices in Zanzibar are routinely quoted in dollars — alongside, or occasionally instead of, the island’s official currency, the Tanzanian shilling.)"

A mother and her young son, held captive for years in a locked room, do not go mad and destroy each other.

Train of Jewels,2014-05-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An episode from World War II is brought into the present.,"In 2005, the settlement of a notorious case of postwar liability took place in a federal court in Florida. Sixty years previously, the so-called Hungarian Gold Train had arrived near Salzburg, Austria, bearing property requisitioned by the Nazis from Hungary’s estimated 800,000 Jewish citizens. Making its way to Germany as the Allies closed in, the train was intercepted by the Americans. Some of its cargo — jewelry, glassware, carpets, bed linen, cutlery, furs, furniture, gold coins, watches and much else from households whose occupants had vanished into the concentration camps — was subsequently commandeered by the generals working on the Marshall Plan, who needed to furnish their headquarters. Numerous items were irretrievably lost, never to be seen again by their rightful owners or by their owners’ heirs. It would take more than half a century for Hungarian survivors of the Holocaust to settle a lawsuit that eventually granted $21 million as compensation to a number of Jewish social service agencies."

Roberts’s book is like one of those packets of heavily sweetened instant oatmeal — you can pretend it’s healthy even as you search out the sugar bombs of drama (her medical crises, her mother’s death, her ratings war with the “Today” show) and celebrity gossip (her 10-year relationship with the girlfriend she met on a blind date: “I liked the fact that she had no idea who I was”). Roberts delivers all of this in the soothing, upbeat voice that has made her so formidable a presence on morning TV. “I’m no Pollyanna,” she says in the current issue of Good Housekeeping, “but I believe optimism is a choice — a muscle that gets stronger with use. Right foot, left foot . . . just keep moving.” This spirit of levelheaded resolve is widely credited with helping Roberts topple “Today” from its perch in 2012. But she almost didn’t get the chance. “She was a woman of great personal dignity, stately beauty and, what’s most important in her mysterious genre, a certain je ne sais quoi that you can’t just order up by the ounce from human resources,” the media reporter Brian Stelter wrote of Roberts in “Top of the Morning,” his 2013 best seller about the competition for breakfast-hour viewers. “Naturally, because morning TV still comes down to a group of elite men trying to guess the needs of a mass audience of mostly women, many of the powers that were at ABC wanted to fire her” as soon as feasible."

"See It, Feel It, Touch It, Be Healed",2014-05-02,article,News,,[],"Lygia Clark is not well known in the United States, a circumstance that should be corrected by a new exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.","Though she was one of Brazil’s most celebrated artists of the post-World War II era, Lygia Clark (1920-88) is not well known in the United States, a circumstance that should be corrected by “Lygia Clark: The Abandonment of Art, 1948-1988,” beginning Saturday at the Museum of Modern Art. Clark started out as a maker of geometric abstractions under the influences of Klee, Mondrian and Léger. In the 1960s she was associated with Neo-Concretism, the Brazilian movement that insisted on the sensual and material — as opposed to intellectual — properties of paintings and sculpture, sometimes encouraging viewer interaction with objects and installations. After 1966, Clark claimed to have abandoned art. She shifted her approach away from creating conventional forms and toward a kind of art therapy that involved the application of materials and devices directly to the people’s bodies. Art was treated as a form of psychological healing. Her late works should be of particular interest to fans of socially engaged and otherwise participatory types of art making.

What’s On Sunday,2014-05-04,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Discovery) EVEREST AVALANCHE TRAGEDY On April 18 an NBC News team waited at the base camp on Mount Everest as it prepared to produce “Everest Jump Live,” a special about the climber Joby Ogwyn’s attempt to make the first wing-suit flight off the 29,029-foot summit of the world’s tallest mountain. That morning an avalanche struck the Khumbu Icefall, killing 13 Sherpa guides and leaving three missing — the highest death toll in a single day in the mountain’s history. This documentary covers the weeks leading up to the tragedy and the subsequent rescue and recovery efforts through real-time film footage and witness accounts. Among those interviewed are Mr. Ogwyn, above; Garrett Madison, the expedition leader; and Todd Burleson, the president of Alpine Ascents International, which lost five guides. It also pays tribute to the Sherpas and their families; the network will make a contribution to the American Himalayan Foundation’s Sherpa Family Fund, from which all donations will flow to relatives of the deceased. In “Bear Grylls: Man vs. Everest,” leading in at 8, Mr. Grylls presents stories of the greatest Everest attempts, using archival footage and interviews with climbers and support crews. In “Bear Grylls: Everest After the Avalanche,” at 10:30, he draws on his own experience — scaling the peak in 1998 at the age of 23 —to explain the allure of the mountain, and the danger."

That sympathy is evident here too, though crucially, while he doesn’t demonize Marie Antoinette, he doesn’t turn her into a spurious feminist martyr.” In French, with English subtitles."

"Old, Good Things Seen Anew",2014-05-07,article,Question,,['ARCHITECTURE'],"Recently named a National Design Award winner, the architecture critic Witold Rybczynski reflects on his attachment to the past.","A rarity among authors who focus on the relentlessly forward-looking profession of architecture, Witold Rybczynski is generally considered something of a conservative. Born in Scotland, educated in England and Canada and residing in Philadelphia, Mr. Rybczynski wrote in the introduction to his most recent book, “How Architecture Works: A Humanist’s Toolkit” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), “I consider history a gift, rather than an imposition.” While a few of his 18 books are set firmly in the past, most, like the 1986 best-seller, “Home: A Short History of an Idea,” use a broad historical perspective to better frame the present. His writing has a patient, deliberate quality that is rare at a moment when the dominant medium of architectural discourse is Twitter. Perhaps this is why Mr. Rybczynski, despite himself, is suddenly all the rage. On May 1 he was named a “Design Mind” by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in its annual National Design Awards, an honor generally bestowed on visionary thinkers. On the same day he attended the National Magazine Awards as a nominee for three columns he wrote for Architect magazine in which he revisited significant buildings and neighborhoods that were completed many years ago to see how they’ve stood the test of time. (This interview, which was conducted by phone and email, has been edited and condensed.)"

Cradle of Civil Disobedience,2014-05-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In South Africa, Gandhi forged the philosophy and strategies that would steer India to independence.","At the end of the 19th century, Mohandas Gandhi was a young lawyer living in Durban, South Africa. He left his house in Beach Grove every morning for an office on Mercury Lane, where he spent much of the day helping his fellow Indian immigrants navigate the onerous colonial bureaucracy. He kept meticulous records, including a logbook of correspondence — from an English missionary and local planters, and a series of letters exchanged with the Protector of Indian Immigrants about the treatment of indentured laborers. In January of 1897, and again a few months later, he heard from another lawyer who was, like him, a Gujarati who had studied in England and then struggled to establish a practice in Bombay. The contents of these letters are unknown. In a remarkable new biography, “Gandhi Before India,” Ramachandra Guha gingerly speculates about what they might have been. Expressions of support for Gandhi’s nascent activism? Or perhaps “explorations of interest in a possible career in South Africa”? Guha wisely stops there. What is not in doubt is the name in Gandhi’s logbook — “M. A. Jinnah,” Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who would become the founder of Pakistan. “All we now know is that, a full 50 years before partition and the independence of India and Pakistan, the respective ‘Fathers’ of those nations were in correspondence.”"

Pledges of Allegiance,2014-05-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Competing visions of the American dream collide in this account of a post-9/11 hate crime and its unlikely reverberations.,"Ten days after 9/11, self-professed “Texas loud, Texas proud” Mark Stroman walked into a Dallas mini-mart, pulled out a gun and asked the brown man working behind the counter where he was from. The hesitation in the clerk’s reply was enough to unleash Stroman’s hatred for Muslims, whom he referred to as people with “shawls on their face.” Stroman pulled the trigger, but his victim, Raisuddin Bhuiyan, an enterprising immigrant from Bangladesh — and a Muslim, indeed — would survive. The other two victims from the fortnight’s vigilante shooting spree, immigrants from India and Pakistan, would not. So begins Anand Giridharadas’s “The True American,” a richly detailed, affecting account of two men bound, as it turned out, by more than just an act of violence."

Mr. Rizzo, as an interloper or part of the set, wore a rabbit mask."

The American Beverage Association, as it happens, pretty much says the same thing on its website: “Quite simply, overweight and obesity are a result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories burned.” "

Delhi is India’s capital. It is where the nation’s networks of crony capitalism converge, where money seeks license to earn more money. Delhi talks to itself about money — about what money can buy, about the cabinet minister pocketing kickbacks, about the suburban swatch of land that a lawyer’s untaxed, all-cash fee has purchased and, in near-reverential tones, about the ingenious and illegal ways more money can be made. This last subject, in particular, exercises the city’s soul enormously. Delhi is flatulent with greed."

Here, under wavering palm trees, teenagers slip through homes and streets with the vagueness that comes with certain visions of adolescence. These aren’t the tireless achievers cramming for tests, and preparing for college and the conformity to come.

Barbara Kingsolver on Elizabeth Gilbert’s “Signature of All Things.” Or we group a few books together, as we did last week with three biographies about James Madison, John Quincy Adams and Louisa Catherine Adams.Occasionally, we run a theme issue, like one we did in April on money or one last year that looked at writing about sex. This week, we did something slightly different. While we didn’t create an entire issue around a theme, we decided to highlight six new books on the cover that took on the subcontinent as their subject matter. These spring releases really stood out: Rana Dasgupta’s “Capital,” John Keay’s “Midnight’s Descendants,” Ramachandra Guha’s “Gandhi Before India,” Saadat Hasan Manto’s “Bombay Stories,” Anand Giridharadas’s “True American” and Amitava Kumar’s “Matter of Rats.”"

There is little nostalgia among the Irish for handball alleys, O Halloran says. “I don’t think people would value them the way they value a traditional cottage, old crosses or ancient ruins,” he says. “A lot of people see them as eyesores.” Julie Bosman"

They had lived there until July, when they were evicted and moved in with Ann’s mother in Sugarloaf, a more affluent township nearby. There was not much to miss about Hazleton, with its decaying downtown and its fading homes spotted with satellite dishes, but to Ann and Tom the town held a shimmering appeal: It had heroin, a lot of it. They had called the usual friends for a ride, with no luck, and their own car had been repossessed. So at midday, the two left Ann’s mother’s condominium by foot and followed the asphalt out of the valley all the way to Hazleton. Eventually they turned onto Alter Street, where, especially in summer, heroin dealers greeted customers outside a packed barbershop and a busy pawnshop, clustering around them, competing for business. Sometimes Ann and Tom joined other users they knew behind a building, where someone had left a tattered couch. Sometimes they got high in an abandoned garage on a side street. Though the walk that day to Alter Street was long, it was worth it to them both: Tom, especially, loved heroin, and Ann loved Tom, and the march to Hazleton was as much about need as it was about love."

Consider how he introduces Virginia Woolf’s last afternoon on earth in the opening sentence of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “The Hours”: “She hurries from the house, wearing a coat too heavy for the weather.” And his 2010 novel “By Nightfall” ended with some rather Joycean evening snow tapping at the bedroom window of an affluent, troubled Manhattan husband, a man about to have a reckoning with his own self-centeredness.

Woven into this dark tale is the equally absorbing story of a daughter’s quest to research and imagine an elusive woman in order to get close to her, even though her very essence embodied distance: “For all of us, Lucile — her gentleness and her aggression — remains a mystery.” The difficulty de Vigan has in describing her mother, she confesses, “is not so far removed from the distress we felt as children and teenagers when she disappeared.” Which she did, dramatically, in a series of manic episodes, beginning in her early 30s."
Inside the List,2014-05-09,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Greg Iles, whose thriller “Natchez Burning” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 2, reworked the novel after a car crash that left him in a coma for eight days.","Life’s Too Short: Greg Iles’s thriller “Natchez Burning,” about racism and murder in the Jim Crow South, is his first new novel in five years. That’s a long time between books for a writer whose previous best sellers arrived as regularly as the Olympics, every two years or so. But Iles has a good excuse. In 2011, when he was putting the finishing touches on an earlier version of “Natchez Burning,” he was in a car crash that tore his aorta, left him in a coma for eight days and resulted in the loss of his right leg below the knee. The accident, along with the death of his father a year earlier, inspired him to have another go at his novel. “I realized that life was too short to pull any punches,” Iles told The Greenville News in South Carolina earlier this month. “I decided there was no room in this book for formula and fluff. The story had to be handled with appropriate gravitas. I had to deal with it not only the way it deserved but in a way that would make my father proud.” The reworked “Natchez Burning” — which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 2 — clocks in at almost 800 pages, and is the first of a planned trilogy. Among other things, it explores the role of social elites in allowing racism to thrive. “The white lower middle class and lower class did not commit those acts of violence in a vacuum,” Iles told The Greenville News. “They had been given tacit approval by the upper levels of white society.” Nor, he said, is such racism restricted to the past. “Look at the scandal over the comments by the Clippers’ owner,” he said, referring to Donald Sterling. “The legacy of slavery is the greatest psychic wound in the American character. We still haven’t fully dealt with it, and I think it’ll take another lifetime to deal with it.”"

Slumber Party,2014-05-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"From lullabies to tall tales and animal menageries, these books explore the magic and mystery of nighttime.","I don’t know about yours, but my bedtime reading does not generally — ever, actually — include books about falling asleep. This should seem strange only to young children, for whom the provision of books about sleeping and not sleeping has captured a large slice of the picture book market. Dr. Robert Needlman, who revised and updated Dr. Benjamin Spock’s “Baby and Child Care,” once told me that the purpose of bedtime stories is to give the imagination a kind of way station between wakefulness and sleep that facilitates an easier slip into unconsciousness. (We were talking about young children, but I think this goes for all of us.) So books for bedtime, sure. But why about? Four new books, swaddled in practically identical shades of sleepy-time blue, attempt to make a case for the genre. Some do a better job than others."

Or Ramona Quimby baking her doll into ­Beezus’ birthday cake?"

She’s sick of dealing with mean-girl bullies and getting stuck playing the triangle in music class. The brainy and impulsive girl thinks that if she exposes the new town gravedigger as a Communist, everyone from her inattentive parents to Senator McCarthy himself will recognize her as the heroine she’s meant to be."

German bombs had blown out 700 of the school’s windows; its students had been evacuated to the countryside. The military men sat on hard benches with overcoats buttoned, blankets on laps. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, standing before a 30-foot-wide plaster relief map of the coast of Normandy, announced that if anyone saw a problem with the plan the group was about to hear, he should speak up. “I have no sympathy with anyone,” he said, “whatever his station, who will not brook criticism.” Then the “wiry, elfin” British Gen. Bernard L. Montgomery began, “in his reedy voice, each word as sharply creased as his trousers,” to describe the invasion intended to mortally wound Hitler’s Third Reich."

What’s On Sunday,2014-05-11,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (NBC) ROSEMARY’S BABY In this two-part remake of the 1968 Roman Polanski thriller, the director Agnieszka Holland transfers the setting from the Dakota on Central Park West to the Eighth Arrondissement of Paris, where Rosemary Woodhouse (Zoe Saldana, above) has moved with her husband, Guy (Patrick J. Adams), a writer with a teaching stint at the Sorbonne. Ms. Holland also transforms the dotty older couple next door, first played by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, into French sophisticates (Carole Bouquet and Jason Isaacs) who offer the Americans their friendship and a spare apartment. This being Paris, they discuss the transaction in an elegant sex club. And when Rosemary, eager to get pregnant again after a miscarriage, visits an OBGYN, the examining room looks like the rare-books section of the Académie Française. “ ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ bends to current fashions, and, accordingly, is more straightforward and much gorier than the original film,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “But partly because the story has been so altered, it still has mystery and suspense. And because it’s Paris, it is possible to wonder, at least for a while, if maybe the problem is Rosemary, not her neighbors, who seem so serenely superior and all knowing.” Part 2 will be shown on Thursday at 9."

Mr. Dolan, 62, said this would reduce the risk to people who might be reluctant to put money into a new organization without a long track record.

Rarified Perfume: The Perks of Membership at MiN New York,2014-05-12,article,News,,['Perfumes and Fragrances'],"The indie apothecary is accepting applications for access to Scent Stories, a new collection of 11 unisex scents that include notes like pencil shavings and ozone.","As the co-curators of the indie apothecary MiN New York in NoLita, Chad Murawczyk and Mindy Yang take a simple approach to stocking their shelves: “If we can’t find something we want, we make it,” Murawczyk says. So far, that’s lead to such varied creations as atmospheric candles gilded in precious metals, high-performance skin-care creams and hand-ticked silk scarves depicting photographs of Havana shot by Murawczyk himself. The latest addition to the MiN oeuvre: a series of abstract fragrances, called Scent Stories, debuting this week. Composed of notes that normally don’t land in eau, such as pencil shavings and ozone, the collection of 11 unisex scents took a year to develop with a master perfumer in Grasse, France. “The idea was to make each scent like a chapter or a short story: it would be vivid, visceral and disconnected from the others, but take you somewhere,” Yang says. Indeed, many of the fragrances were inspired by the pair’s own memories and journeys. Dahab, for example, evokes the deserts and deep seas of Egypt where Murawczyk spent time. “It’s incense-y, smoky and mysterious,” he says of the saffron-, cumin- and nutmeg-laced blend. Yang, who is also a trained reiki healer, is particularly drawn to Shaman, describing it as a “futurist nomad” scent, with a “mystical air.” The violet leaf note is especially nuanced, she says, and conveys “a sense of clairvoyance.”"

What’s On Monday,2014-05-12,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"6:45 P.M. (Cinemax) MAMA (2013) In this modern fairy tale directed by Andy Muschietti, the uncle (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) of two feral sisters (Megan Charpentier, above, and Isabelle Nélisse), abandoned by their father in the woods, moves them into a home with his goth girlfriend (Jessica Chastain). Then a grotesque figure the girls call Mama appears in the shadows and begins to wreak havoc on their lives. But is the monster simply a coping mechanism for dealing with tragedy? Or is Mama the essence of the girls’ dead mother? “Instead of delivering buckets of guts and gore, this ghost story offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don’t often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you don’t want anyone to take an ax to them,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

It’s Ruby’s first solo show in Chelsea since he parked two menacing, rectilinear forms (a bus and a big brick of human-size cages) inside the Pace Gallery four years ago. This new show, entitled “Sunrise, Sunset,” presents a dense cross-section of recent works the prolific and controversial artist has produced in his fabled studio-cum-industrial-complex on the outskirts of Downtown L.A. — where only weeks ago, a Mack truck veered off the road and through the wall of the building, destroying a number of mammoth spray paintings and Ruby’s studio manager’s car (fortunately, no one was injured). Though the accident was a setback, the grandiose, unexpected destruction of the incident aligned well with Ruby’s expansive practice. The exhibition is full of charged objects, including Corinthian columns dripping with lustrous red polyurethane, a super-size canary-yellow electric chair, infernal stoves and bleached fabrics that evoke everything from Rorschach tests to the American flag. Here, the artist reflects on his intentions for the show and his place in the art world. "

Davis, a partner at Davis Brody Bond, the lead architects for the museum. “If you think about the notion of a traditional museum as an icon which contains exhibits, here we have the inverse,” Davis says. “These are exhibits that are in fact the icon.” The museum opens to survivors and victims’ families on May 15; the public can visit starting May 21. In designing the space, which extends 70 feet below the memorial plaza, Davis says he wanted the experience to be physical — visitors enter by descending a ramp, as if drawn by gravity — but also heavy with symbolism and emotion. How does he hope people will feel when they leave? “Optimistic about the future,” he says. “That we have the wherewithal as a society to create positive results from negative events.” Julie Bosman"

What’s On Wednesday,2014-05-14,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"7:30 A.M. (FX Movie Channel) STANLEY AND LIVINGSTONE (1939) In the first of two African adventures directed by Henry King, Henry Stanley (Spencer Tracy), a reporter for The New York Herald, travels to Zanzibar in search of the long-missing British missionary Dr. David Livingstone (Cedric Hardwicke). Writing in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called the lavish production — which helped to immortalize the famous greeting “Dr. Livingstone, I presume” — “intelligent and restrained and dignified.” In “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” (1952), at 9:30, adapted from the short story by Ernest Hemingway, an author (Gregory Peck, above with Susan Hayward) seriously wounded in a hunting accident reflects on the love (Ava Gardner) he lost and the novel he never wrote. Mr. King and the producer Darryl Zanuck “have made a picture that constantly fascinates the eye and stimulates the emotions in small, isolated ways,” Mr. Crowther wrote in The Times. He added: “The shots of wild animals in Africa — elephants, lions, rhinoceroses, giraffes and all manner of lesser creatures — are as magnificent and exciting as any yet, and the atmosphere and beauty of a safari under the snowy peak of Kilimanjaro are superb. Especially one sequence in close-up of a swimming herd of hippopotamuses goes down in this reviewer’s notebook as the best one of game we’ve ever seen.”"
Anger Grows in Vietnam Over Dispute With China,2014-05-14,article,News,,"['Demonstrations, Protests, and Riots', 'Offshore Drilling and Exploration', 'Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline', 'Ships and Shipping', 'International Relations']",The dispute has unleashed some of the worst civil unrest in recent years in Vietnam and has prompted what appears to have been a news media blackout by the government.,"HANOI, Vietnam — Thousands of workers rampaged through an industrial area in southern Vietnam on Tuesday in what reportedly began as protests against China’s stationing of an oil rig in disputed waters off of Vietnam’s coast.  The riots were some of the worst civil unrest in recent years and appear to have prompted  restraints on the local media by Vietnam’s authoritarian government. An article about the protests that was posted online by a Vietnamese state newspaper on Tuesday was removed by Wednesday morning.  The Chinese Embassy in Hanoi issued a notice on Wednesday that urged Chinese living in Vietnam to “minimize unnecessary outings.”  A staff member at the Chutex Garment Factory north of Ho Chi Minh City said 8,000 to 10,000 workers were involved in the rampage at his factory.  “They burned the office,” said the staff member who agreed to speak on condition that his name not be used. The rioters “burned everything, all of the materials, computers, machines.”  Police units and fire fighters arrived at the factory Tuesday and “disbanded,” the rioters, he said. On Wednesday morning police “captured” around 15 to 20 men who were attempting to loot the premises, he said.  The Chutex factory, located in Song Than Industrial Park 2 in southern Binh Duong Province, is described on its web site as one of the largest garment exporters in Vietnam. Chutex International, the parent company, was founded by a Taiwanese garment executive.  It is unclear why rioters targeted a factory linked to Taiwan. Media in Hong Kong said  workers might not have been distinguishing between mainland China and Taiwan, a self-governing island which also has claims to territory in the South China Sea."

In it, he discusses his intentions, methodologies and views on aesthetic value systems. “My basic tenet is relatively simple,” he explains. “To relate the former to the future, the last to the next.” Heinecken carries out this philosophy quite literally in one of the best known strands of his practice, a related series of double exposures made from the 1960s to the 1990s, in which he culled current events and women’s magazines to find individual pages containing two faces that made unforgettable figurative abstractions when overlaid."

All the usual stuff.”","Something Different: Fans of long-­running series can have a hard time letting go. When Arthur Conan Doyle tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes in 1893, readers objected so strenuously that Doyle — after trying to mollify them with a prequel — finally gave in and resurrected the character as a cross-dressing mixed martial artist played by Robert Downey Jr. More recently, Charlaine Harris has heard from readers livid at her 2013 novel “Dead Ever After,” which ended her beloved Sookie Stackhouse urban fantasy series (the basis for the HBO show “True Blood”). “I had death threats, and people putting curses on me,” she said in a recent phone conversation. “All the usual stuff.” But Sookie is well and truly finished, Harris insists: “She’s in my rearview mirror. It was not a hard choice. Of course, it’s a little scary when you’re making such and such dollars a year because of a character. But when I’ve told the story I had to tell, it’s time to start something different.”"

Any of these roles felt more endurable than her own."
Scandalous Women,2014-05-16,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Audiobooks']",Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary” and Zola’s “Thérèse Raquin” get the star treatment in new audiobooks.,"The publication of Gustave Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary” in 1857 and of Émile Zola’s “Thérèse Raquin” 10 years later roused the French literary establishment against two previously unknown authors who had gone beyond the bounds of all that was held to be morally admissible in fiction with their portraits of adulterous women starved by marriage of sex and romance. The state prosecuted Flaubert for gross indecency, despite the terrible punishment he metes out to his wayward heroine. Zola was not subjected to the same ordeal, but critics treated him as a rogue purveying smut in the name of realism. Both novels have appeared in countless editions since the 19th century. Both have been adapted to the screen. Now they are available as audiobooks, read by two gifted English actresses: “Madame Bovary” by Juliet Stevenson and “Thérèse Raquin” by Kate Winslet."
Talk of the Town,2014-05-16,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Audiobooks']",Actors read works by John O’Hara and Truman Capote set in a bygone Manhattan.,"It would be hard to think of two writers less alike — stylistically and, for that matter, personally — than Truman Capote and John O’Hara, yet they shared many pre­occupations. Both were fascinated by society high and low, by how people climbed or toppled from one rank to the other, and by how sex and money underpinned the entire system. “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” Capote’s charming 1958 novella about a self-invented cafe society girl and the admiring writer who lives upstairs, is set during World War II. Most of the stories assembled in the recent Penguin anthology of O’Hara’s New York stories were written in either the ’30s or the ’60s, but some are set decades earlier. And yet in the newly released audio recordings of the two books, maybe even more than on the page, the versions of New York that are evoked seem virtually interchangeable: It’s a city of people on the make or else clinging to their former reputations, where everyone drinks too much, and where you can easily wake up in bed next to someone you barely remember meeting."

A World War I history (or two) can be an ideal companion.,"In my home state, California, we listen to audiobooks mostly while driving. When stuck in freeway traffic, I sometimes wonder whether the guy in my rearview mirror is secretly absorbed in “Harry Potter,” or if the smiling woman in the next lane is hearing Mr. Darcy woo Elizabeth Bennet. When it comes to immersing yourself in the First World War by audio, however, you’ll need more than a short commute. The war was very long, the books about it tend to be very long, and about this cataclysm that so thoroughly changed our world for the worse, surely you don’t want to listen to merely one book? So I suggest you reserve this listening for some road trip of epic length, like that drive you’ve always wanted to take from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, or from Rotterdam to Vladivostok. Here are some suggestions for the journey:"
The Unpossessed,2014-05-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A collection that reinterprets classic stories from the perspective of women who are emotionally adrift.,"In 2008, Rivka Galchen published her first novel, “Atmospheric Disturbances,” about a man who believes his wife has been replaced by a replica of herself. Enfolded into the story was also one Dr. Tzvi Gal-Chen, who shares his name (down to the hyphen) with Galchen’s own father, a meteorologist who died in 1994. Combining aspects of her own biography, the physical sciences and psychiatry — Galchen is herself a medical doctor, trained in psychiatry — she created a vertiginous narrative about the nature of love and loss. Even if the book’s momentum ultimately flagged, it showed Galchen to be a bold, inventive and smart young writer."

Every Little Byte Counts,2014-05-16,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Data-Mining and Database Marketing']","The ubiquity of data gathering has staggering implications for understanding, predicting and influencing human behavior.","In “On What We Can Not Do,” a short and pungent essay published a few years ago, the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben outlined two ways in which power operates today. There’s the conventional type that seeks to limit our potential for self-­development by restricting material resources and banning certain behaviors. But there’s also a subtler, more insidious type, which limits not what we can do but what we can not do. What’s at stake here is not so much our ability to do things but our capacity not to make use of that very ability."

Or so argued Montesquieu, an Enlightenment philosopher whose work profoundly influenced the drafters of our Constitution. Were he alive today, Montesquieu might need to reconsider. The United States may or may not be the leader of the free world, but it is indisputably the world leader in locking up human beings behind bars. We are less than 5 percent of the world’s population, but we warehouse 25 percent of the world’s incarcerated population. Our per capita incarceration rate is seven times greater than France’s, 14 times greater than Japan’s and 24 times greater than India’s. "

Lee Rickard and Sean Bohrman, former bandmates in Thee Makeout Party!, started the Burger Records label in 2007 and opened a record store two years later; in that time they’ve become the center of a scene that’s generating excitement, loyalty and a sense of identity, especially among an Orange County contingent that’s under the legal drinking age and hungry for local culture. Burger’s pace has become manic lately — it released 300 items last year, between cassette-only editions or reissues and original albums on LP and CD — but it seems to be working: Burgerama, its annual two-day festival in Santa Ana, sold 10,000 tickets this year, and its bands (including Cherry Glazerr, Together Pangea, Audacity, the Garden and Gap Dream) have started to move onto the national radar. (Although if all Burger records ever did was to produce the wild, messy, energetic weekly videos for its YouTube channel, BRGRTV, it might have served its purpose on earth.)"

The harrowing story of Patrick’s life — from being raped at 5 by his monstrous father, to his years as a heroin addict, to his achievement of a measure of perspective and peace in middle age — was simultaneously heartbreaking and funny, devastatingly sad and cuttingly acerbic: painful experience transmuted into art through beautifully hammered, aphoristic prose.

Food Matters | An L.A. Chef’s Guide to Adventurous Backyard Cooking,2014-05-20,article,News,,[],"To celebrate the release of his new cookbook, “Taming the Feast,” Ben Ford of Ford’s Filling Station offers T readers tips on pulling off the perfect barbecue.","“You’ve heard the term ‘food orgy,’ ” says Ben Ford. “I love the loss of inhibition when people get in a big group and enjoy a feast. That’s why I did this cookbook.” The chef and owner of Los Angeles’s Ford’s Filling Station gastro pub (and son of Harrison Ford) has authored “Taming the Feast” (Simon and Schuster, $34.99), a how-to guide for bringing “Game of Thrones”-size banquets to your own kitchen table, whether you’re serving a phalanx of friends or just a family of four. “The idea of working with whole animals, trying to close that proximity between the back door of my kitchen and the farmland, the book came out of that,” says Ford. Readers will have a difficult time finding another cookbook with both instructions for “rigging a pig for vertical roasting” and everyday backyard fare, like grilled beer-braised bratwurst or a simple safflower oil aioli. Alternative, more manageable recipes are offered for each feast — in case you, or your landlord, prefers that your paella come from a Weber or stovetop and not an inferno in the backyard. While such projects as sourcing cedar planks on which to roast sturgeon may sound complicated, for Ford the book is actually about getting back to basics; for instance, he teaches techniques like using one’s hands for testing not only the doneness of meat, but also the temperature level over a fire. Says Ford, “I’m very much a touch, feel, smell kind of chef.”"

There are a lot of those: Since his heyday in the early ’70s as a midnight cult-film pioneer with “El Topo” and “The Holy Mountain,” Mr. Jodorowsky’s semimythic status as a cinematic wild man has outstripped his productivity as a director. So the arrival of a new feature — his first since 1990 — would be grounds for excitement even, if the movie in question, “The Dance of Reality,” were not something very close to a masterpiece."

In high-culture circles, it used to be taken for granted that there was, and there was a well-established canon of great artworks to prove it, from Leonardo’s “Mona Lisa” to Jackson Pollock’s drip paintings. Then, at the end of the 1960s, scholars like Linda Nochlin, author of “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?,” began to wonder why the canon consisted almost exclusively of works by male Caucasians. Is genius something that only white men are capable of?

Walmer was shocked by what he saw: Fertilien finishing a hysterectomy with the aid of a flashlight when the hospital generator failed to restart, for instance, or when an anesthesiologist wasn’t available for an emergency C-section, the doctor just numbing the skin and cutting. At one point, Walmer was called to the bedside of a young woman in her mid-20s with undiagnosed cervical cancer who had gone into septic shock. There was nothing to be done for her, and she died right in front of him. Walmer was appalled. In the United States, cervical cancer is considered a preventable disease."

The photographer Alec Soth recently visited the Belle Plaine public high school, an hour outside Minneapolis, to witness its routine. When the principal announced that a lockdown was in effect, classroom doors were quickly locked; students who were in the middle of gym class moved to locker rooms and secured the doors behind them.

The fact that language has musical attributes — rhythm, melody, tone — isn’t much help when you’re trying to express Bartok or Captain Beefheart in words. Even when music has lyrics, its essence is antilanguage, or at least in another language — and an inability to translate explains why so many album and concert reviews are unreadable. Thus Stacey D’Erasmo’s most impressive accomplishment in her fourth novel, “Wonderland,” is to write about music well."
By the Booker,2014-05-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In a change of pace, Edward St. Aubyn’s novel satirizes the awarding of a British literary prize.","Edward St. Aubyn is that thing beloved by heritage series from the BBC, a man of ancient and aristocratic pedigree. He writes of an upper-class world so central to the English novel of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it has shaped the modern imagination: You might think we all sprang from big houses with handmade wallpaper and quietly smoldering servants. St. Aubyn cuts through the fantasy of privilege, however, with lacerating precision; once you have read his Melrose cycle of novels, there is no going back. These books — “Never Mind,” “Bad News,” “Some Hope,” “Mother’s Milk” and “At Last” — set a marker in the English tradition by changing our view of what preceded them. The narrator, Patrick Melrose, is raped at the age of 5 by his sadistic, patrician father and later partially disinherited by his cold and foolish mother. After Melrose, the aristocratic novel, from Richardson’s swooning “Pamela” to the affectless cruelties of Waugh, can never look the same again. "

That was partly because at that moment the Democratic Party controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, so there wasn’t a dominant conservative politician to focus on; partly because of a wave of news media attention, notably an influential story on the Kochs’ political activities by Jane Mayer in The New Yorker; and partly because of the rise of the Tea Party movement, of which the Koch political apparatus was a primary backer. The conservative victories in the Congres­sional elections that fall looked like conclusive proof of the Kochs’ power. The very first television ads the Obama re-election campaign ran in 2012 were attacks on the Kochs, not on the Republican Party."

Writer’s Retreat,2014-05-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A student moves to her parents’ cabin to finish a dissertation.,"A doctoral dissertation not getting written is never just a doctoral dissertation not getting written. It’s always a stand-in for something more consequential (take it from a former grad student who knows). But when we encounter Cressida (Cress) Hartley, the protagonist of Michelle Huneven’s fourth novel, “Off Course,” she doesn’t realize this yet. In fact, she has just persuaded her parents to allow her to live in their vacation cabin in California’s Sierra Nevada for “three months free and clear,” so that she can “bang . . . out” her dissertation in economics. The 28-year-old, high-achieving Cress comes from cautious, stingy stock, a foundation that gives her a natural aptitude for her field: Her father is a “traumatized victim of the Great Depression,” and his “fears and obsessions had imprinted her with thought patterns that, superficially at least, were indistinguishable from the mind-set of a trained economist: What is given up to get this?

Part of the perverse allure of this series — which now numbers some dozen books — has always come from the demented nature of its villains, and “The Skin Collector” is no exception: It features a ­serial-killing tattoo artist who makes his own ink out of a slow-acting and painful poison. But a person can spend only so many hours a day inventing gruesome murder schemes, and one of the ways Deaver likes to unwind is by breeding show dogs with a business partner near his North Carolina home. “I’m not as creepy as the things I write about,” he told The Associated Press in 2007. That doesn’t mean you can’t question his priorities — he once passed up dinner with Angelina Jolie to tend to a dog’s matted coat. But Deaver knows what he’s doing: His briards have won Best of Breed more than once at the Westminster Kennel Club show in New York. “Your heart’s pounding,” he told a reporter in 2005, comparing the experience to that of a father watching a Little League game. “You’ll still love the dog just as much if he doesn’t win. But I can’t help it. I hope he wins.” Given the elaborate plot twists and psychological head games in his novels, is Deaver ever tempted to mess with his dogs’ minds, just a little? “I couldn’t possibly do that,” he told The Sun Herald newspaper in Australia in 2006. “The dogs are much cleverer than me.”"

What’s on Saturday,2014-05-24,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (Cinemax) THE WORLD’S END (2013) In the summer of 1990, five British teenagers set out on a pub crawl in the town of Newton Haven, vomiting, fighting and having drunken sex along what is known as the Golden Mile. But they failed to make it through the 12 requisite watering holes, the last of which was called the World’s End. Twenty years later, they give it a second try in this comedy directed by Edgar Wright, the final installment in his Cornetto Trilogy, following “Shaun of the Dead” and “Hot Fuzz.” Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Paddy Considine, along with Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan, play the Golden Milers. Four have traded their wild youth for adult respectability; the fifth decidedly has not. Then the robots show up, and these men just may be humanity’s only hope for survival. “The Cornetto Trilogy is named after a popular ice cream treat, and the buzz of ‘The World’s End’ is more like an antic sugar high than a reeling, drunken stupor,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “There are no headaches, dry mouth or crushing shame at the end — no ‘Hangover,’ in other words. I’ll drink to that.”"

The kids closest to my age, Virginie, Éric and Benoît, treated me like a sister, not like a tourist from Indiana, where I came from. Together we gathered eggs, rode on Mobylettes to the village candy store, set the table when the curé came to lunch, watched the French version of “The Avengers,” and squabbled over who got to ride shotgun on car trips.

Health Officials Reverse Diagnosis of MERS in Illinois Man,2014-05-29,article,Brief,,['MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)'],Federal health officials said Wednesday that an Illinois man who met with an Indiana man who later fell ill with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome did not pick up the virus from him.,"Reversing an earlier announcement, federal health officials said Wednesday that an Illinois man who met with an Indiana man who later fell ill with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, did not pick up the virus from him. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a first lung sample from the Illinois man had tested negative for the coronavirus that causes MERS, but two preliminary blood samples had then tested positive for antibodies to it. That led the C.D.C. to announce on May 17 that the man had been infected but had not fallen ill; this would have been the first transmission of the virus within the United States. On Wednesday, they said that a more sensitive blood test that takes at least five days to produce results showed that he never had the virus. The most likely explanation, one of the officials said, is that the preliminary test had cross-reacted with antibodies the man had to a previous coronavirus infection. At least six coronaviruses are known to infect humans: Four normally cause common cold symptoms, while the other two, MERS and SARS, are more serious. Only two MERS cases have been found in the United States — the Indiana man and another in Florida. Both had recently arrived after working in Saudi hospitals where there have been hundreds of cases since March. Thus far, C.D.C. officials said, extensive testing indicates that the two men did not pass on the virus to any family members or health care workers treating them. "

The truth seeker is Jekyll’s lawyer, Utterson, the book’s most prominent character. Jekyll — the ­gentleman who dabbles in chemical self-­transformation — appears only ­intermittently, never fully speaking for himself until the end, when he discloses the details of the disastrous experiments that unleashed his primitive alter ego. The novel isn’t a conventional horror story, lingering on the macabre for its own sake, but an allegory of the divided self, perhaps also a meditation on addiction. Stevenson dramatizes human duality but doesn’t analyze its causes, treating it as pervasive and fundamental. For him, the Jekyll-Hyde split is the split in all of us, between the animals we evolved from and the angels we aspire to be."

It came from “Goodbye, Columbus,” where Neil Klugman tells Brenda Patimkin that his cousin Doris always has “War and Peace” by the pool: “That’s how I know it’s the summer, when Doris is reading ‘War and Peace.’ ” Pool and beach being the same to me back then — an idiot kid forced to sit outside with no TV, uncomfortable with my shirt off as my grandfather paraded around to show off he still had a body — I didn’t see that Philip Roth was mocking Doris, and so for years protected myself from the water and sand I resented and feared by lugging along a classic. This is how I read “Swann’s Way” at the Mamaroneck Beach Club as a guest of Uncle Marty and Aunt Lee. It took many visits. Here I would like to thank them personally."
Success Is in the Eye of the Beholder,2014-05-30,article,News,,['Soccer'],"Win, lose or draw, professional players cherish support from their fans.","I smile and sign autographs no matter what. Most fans don’t seem to care much if we won or lost. They don’t know if I had the game of my life or a complete shocker. They say, “Great game! You were awesome!” Sometimes they even tell me I was wonderful when I didn’t play a single minute. I thank them whether I feel on top of the world or have a lump of disappointment in my throat."
Travel,2014-05-30,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Travel and Vacations']","New travel books include John Waters’s “Carsick,” in which the director hitchhikes from one of his homes in Baltimore to another of his homes in San Francisco.","Paul Bowles observed that an important difference between a tourist and a traveler “is that the former accepts his own civilization without question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects those elements he finds not to his liking.” This difference also separates writers about travels from “travel writers.” Is the voyaging writer telling us canny stories from a romping trip or using his peregrinations to relocate his place in the world? Sometimes it’s difficult to tell. D. H. Lawrence knocked off travel essays about places in which he had arrived only a few hours before, but he was writing about himself and his intuitions. Bowles, for his part, lived for years in Morocco but traveled through the desert with a suitcase filled with his favorite neckties. Do we read either man for profound and meticulously earned insights about Sardinia or the Sahara, or for their ability to convey something about themselves as they pass through those places? Most writers are “passing through,” and we expect no more of them. It’s part of their charm, if they have any. And part of the sometimes dubious premise of travel writing itself."

Shall We Dance?,2014-05-30,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Movies']",Richard Barrios surveys the extensive world of movie musicals.,"All movies are musical, film being as reliant on rhythm and tempo as sonatas are. Only a few movies are musicals, though, and the fewness isn’t going away. Live-action musicals are nearly as endangered a movie species as westerns. Whether you think those few are too many or nowhere near enough will go a long way toward determining your response to Richard Barrios’s “Dangerous Rhythm: Why Movie Musicals Matter.” The subtitle indicates which side Barrios comes down on. The fact of his having written the exhaustively researched and exuberantly argued “A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film” (1995) should settle any doubts."
Street Life,2014-05-30,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Photography']",Two new books explore the possibilities of street photography.,"The flâneur, that feature of the 19th-century urban landscape, stood apart from the city as a wide-eyed wanderer. But when he had a camera in his hands, he became the archetypal street photographer, a curious observer who captured his environment in what Henri Cartier-Bresson called its ""decisive moments”: spontaneous, serendipitous, intuitive, singular. In “Unfamiliar Streets: The Photographs of Richard Avedon, Charles Moore, Martha Rosler, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia,” the art historian Katherine A. Bussard explores the genre of street photography, beginning with this dominant definition and then expanding it. The photographers she investigates, whose work here spans the 1940s through 2001, manipulate the viewer’s imagination of the city, or change the way viewers act within it. According to Bussard, accurately representing experiences of city streets “involves addressing issues of gender, commerce, race, collectivity, class, dispossession, sexuality and spectacle.” In other words, street photography isn’t only the magic of capturing a well-composed slice of life; it’s the more complex task of recapitulating or intensifying the economic, class and gender tensions of the city street within an image. The image should galvanize the viewer or, ideally, alter street life as it’s lived simply by the fact of the image having been made."
Minnesota Nice,2014-05-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A collection of stories, essays, poems and reminiscences from the creator of the public radio show “A Prairie Home Companion.”","Some writers define themselves by contrasting their talents or sensibility with those of another writer. “Well, I’m no Joyce Carol Oates,” they’ll tell you, false modesty oozing from their pores like musk. “I publish a book every eight years.” Or, “You wouldn’t confuse me with Thomas Merton,” they’ll say, referring to the Trappist monk and mystic. “Kneeling bags my nylons.” The best of these self-conscious comparisons may come from James Thurber, who was once asked to review Salvador Dalí’s autobiography. Comparing his own golden-hued Columbus, Ohio, upbringing with young Dalí’s chiaroscuro of ermine capes and necrophilia, Thurber wrote, “The naked truth about me is to the naked truth about Salvador Dalí as an old ukulele in the attic is to a piano in a tree, and I mean a piano with breasts.”"
Appetites,2014-05-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The plucky heroine of the food writer Ruth Reichl’s first novel goes on working for a magazine after it folds.,"Ruth Reichl is known for many things, among them her best-selling memoirs, including “Tender at the Bone” and “Comfort Me With Apples,” as well as her years of reviewing restaurants for both The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, and as the editor in chief of the seemingly immortal Gourmet magazine — until it folded. With the arrival of Twitter, Reichl added another genre to her résumé: haiku-like paeans to breakfast in any weather: “Sunny in Charlotte. Returned to rain. Gray New York morning. Big bowl of ginger strewn congee. Chiles. Soy. Scallion. So consoled.” The next day, it was still raining, but once again food came to the rescue: “Gray drizzle. Umbrellas up. Sidewalks sloppy. Rye bread, still warm. Herring: pungent, rich. Sour cream. Onions. Solace in the city.” "

If you’re a writer, you brew a pot of coffee, adjust the lights, go over your notes and get started, though you know that something — a phone call, a memory, a random image — is likely to barge in and change everything. Instead of “art,” of course, you could say “science,” “making gumbo” and even “romance”: You show up at Veronica’s apartment with your hair slicked back and a bouquet in your hand, and who answers the door?

Get Down,2014-05-30,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Music', 'Television']","In their new books, Nelson George and Questlove chart the rise and reign of the African-American dance show “Soul Train.”","When I was growing up in Chicago, there was no rowdier time in our house than Friday night, when my mother, my three siblings and I stayed up to watch “Red Hot and Blues” on Channel 26, Chicago’s first UHF station. Part advertisement and part dance spectacle, it was our chance to celebrate the end of the week, listen and dance to our favorite R & B songs and howl at the cheesy commercials delivered by pitchmen selling used cars and ugly furniture: “You’ll do well to see Dell’s — Dell’s Furniture.” (Even hearing the voice was enough to send us all into fits of laughter.) Just as attractive as the music was the lineup of shabbily dressed kids from the West Side who gathered in front of the camera to dance — a great counterpart to us shabbily dressed kids from the South Side. The show was the highlight of our week."

She likes to look at people who are used to being looked at, and she uses her camera like Wonder Woman’s golden lasso — as a truth-telling device that peels performance from personality. In one of her most famous photographs, “Tiny” (1983), a Seattle street kid poses in her Halloween costume: a little black dress, little black gloves and a hat with a netted veil. It’s the daintiness of Tiny’s dress combined with her defiance that gives the photograph its charge. Tough Tiny looks afraid."

Journey by Rail,2014-05-30,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Railroads']",Tom Zoellner sets off on a series of railway adventures in an attempt to recapture the power and poetry of train travel.,"In an era of railway mediocrity, epitomized by Amtrak, it’s easy to forget that train travel was once a romantic adventure. Riding the rails to Boston in 1924, George Gershwin listened to the roar of the steam engine and the turn of the wheels and found the inspiration for “Rhapsody in Blue,” his hymn to urbanizing, Jazz Age America. “It was on the train, with its steely rhythms, its rattle-ty bang, that is so often so stimulating to a composer,” he told a biographer, describing the moment of creation. “I frequently hear music in the very heart of the noise.” W. C. Handy and other African-American musicians heard a similar sound on the Illinois Central, the Midwestern line that spirited them away from the Deep South on the Great Migration that began during World War I. They married the whistle and drone of the locomotive to the plaintive chants of sharecroppers and invented the “city blues.” Steve Goodman, a little-known composer, was inspired by a ­journey on the same line to write a dirge that became one of the anthems of the Vietnam War era — “The City of New ­Orleans.”"

Fred’s views filtered down to at least one of his four sons: Charles, the second-oldest and now the chief executive of Koch Industries, spent most of a blind date in the early 1960s railing against the evils of Communism, according to the biography. (“I ended up leaving early and walking home,” his date says.) Charles also let his politics spill over into literary criticism.
