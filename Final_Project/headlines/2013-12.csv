The resurfacing of his other popular standbys — cropped peacoats, oxford shirt dresses, simple knits and soft, draped cocktail dresses — round out the collection so that it essentially becomes a complete wardrobe for the Altuzarra woman. Here, a look at just who that is, along with a behind-the-scenes look at how it all come together."

What’s On Friday,2013-12-06,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"7 P.M. (Sundance) VANILLA SKY (2001) David Aames (Tom Cruise), a 33-year-old master of the universe, finds his life upended after a car crash in Cameron Crowe’s erotic science-fiction adaptation of “Abre los Ojos,” Alejandro Amenábar’s Spanish romantic thriller. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, the latest plaything in David’s endless succession of beautiful women. Penélope Cruz (above, with Mr. Cruise), who starred in Mr. Amenábar’s original, is Sofia Serrano, whom Julie discovers David flirting with at the birthday party he neglected to invite her to. And suddenly the simple offer of a ride the next morning becomes a suicide leap as Julie drives her car off a bridge, leaving her dead and David condemned to wearing a latex mask. “With its roller-coaster plot and surreal special effects, ‘Vanilla Sky’ is not the kind of film one associates with Mr. Crowe,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The most warmhearted of mainstream Hollywood directors, Mr. Crowe has in the past extended to his characters the affection of an unusually careful and sympathetic listener.” In this film, “that ear is not as sharp,” he continued. “Still, the movie carries a lingering tug of sweetness, most apparent in the film’s heady soundtrack,” which “evokes the dream of eternal youth that infuses ‘Vanilla Sky.’ ”"

In the postwar period, amphetamines were very popular until laws were passed to curb their use in the 1950s.

By the 1980s, such vitamin-fortified, extra-caffeinated beverages were being regularly consumed by Japanese executives struggling to get ahead. One television ad showed Arnold Schwarzenegger bursting from a flagon like a juiced-up genie.

That is to say, screen violence calls for barbarous prose; romance requires a warmness of tone. This principle could be applied to writing about all the arts, or most of them — including jazz, as the cultural critic and novelist Stanley Crouch has demonstrated with his judicious, strategically crafted new book about Charlie Parker, the revered and immeasurably influential alto saxophonist and composer. “Kansas City Lightning: The Rise and Times of Charlie Parker” is, like the music made by its subject in his abbreviated life, free-flowing and severe, volatile, expansive, allusive and indulgent. From bravura sentence to serpentine paragraph, the book is a virtuoso performance of musical-literary mimesis. "

The images presented here are not illustrations for a narrative; they are the narrative. Hilary Roberts, the head curator of photography at the Imperial War Museums in Britain (home of the world’s most extensive collection of World War I photographs), provided the historical and contextual expertise. Mark Holborn is a celebrated editor of illustrated books and a master of photographic mise-en-scène. The result of their collaboration is a book of extraordinary power and clarity. "

What else could have prompted so many decorators to publish their portfolios, visual memoirs that attest to lives rich with clients? Decorating is one of the most evanescent of the visual arts. It’s painful to walk into a room in which every inch has been lavished with attention, imagination and money, only to learn that the wrecking ball is about to arrive, commissioned by the next decorator.

Photography,2013-12-06,article,Review,,"['Photography', 'Books and Literature']","New books of photography by Sergio Larrain, Josef Koudelka and more.","Sometimes the world of photography books can seem not unlike that of popular music on disc, with endless repackaging of the classics — each new volume containing pictures that haven’t been previously reprinted, so that if you are a devotee or a completist you will have to shell out for another tome. And yet major surprises continue to arrive, dispatches from the past. Consider, for example, the work of the Chilean photographer Sergio Larrain (1931-2012), whose career was both extraordinary and unusually abbreviated. It was only after studying forestry at Berkeley that he began seriously taking pictures in the mid-1950s, and then an encounter with the Bolivian mystic Oscar Ichazo in 1968 caused him to retreat for the remainder of his life into meditation and yoga, taking small, quiet photos only occasionally, as complements to his inner quest. But for the decade or so that he was in the world and regularly taking pictures, his work, as amply illustrated in SERGIO LARRAIN (Aperture, $85), edited by Agnès Sire, was a constant source of wonder."

The trees are bare, the flower beds dormant, the pruners and trowels packed away in the toolshed. All those hours once spent weeding and mowing can now be devoted to recalling our triumphs and brooding over our failures. There’s also, finally, enough leisure time to study other people’s gardens and pick up a few pointers. And yet, infuriatingly, many of those gardens are also in sleep mode. What to do? The answer to that question — as to so many others — can be found in a book. Five of them, to be precise. "

Newton wagged his tail and gave kisses, but that wasn’t enough. Berns, a neuroscientist, wanted hard data. He also hoped to uncover “what makes for a strong dog-human bond” and how that might improve canine welfare. So he built a special M.R.I. machine, and trained dogs to lie still inside it, allowing him to study their brains. Though the results may seem obvious to dog lovers (that humans and dogs experience emotions similarly), they’re not a given for science. Berns’s book is a beautiful story about dogs, love and neurology that shows how nonhuman relationships are inspiring researchers to look at animals in new ways, for their benefit and ours. "

Huston’s mother, Ricki Soma, a ballerina and the daughter of an Italian-restaurant owner in New York, was John Huston’s fourth wife. They eloped when she was 18 and he was in his mid-40s. Huston was their second child and — with her mother now transformed into the beautiful couture-clad “translucent and remote” mistress of a vast West Ireland estate — she was raised amid multiple servants, visiting film-world eminences and colorful locals in the kind of world that has disappeared, other than, say, in movies starring Keira Knightley.

Allure,2013-12-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Virginia Postrel lays out the case for glamour as a life-shaping force, whether for good or for ill.","The jury is still out on glamour. Some critics see it as the scourge of modern society, an illusory opiate doled out by a ruling elite to dazzle the masses into submission. For others glamour is a fragile and endangered species, the inspirational product of simpler times — before, say, a photograph of Scarlett Johansson tripping and falling could become, in the space of an hour, an Internet meme — as our tell-all society collapses the distance between us and our idols irrevocably."
Classical Pottery,2013-12-06,article,Review,,"['Art', 'Books and Literature', 'Greek Civilization', 'Ceramics and Pottery']",An illustrated overview of the main styles and production centers of Greek figurative pottery.,"Not so long ago, developing an informed appreciation for Greek vases, in particular fineware with painted scenes, was no easy matter for anyone aside from serious students and dedicated connoisseurs with access to the world’s museums. As for illustrated books, there wasn’t much between the affordable volumes of John Boardman’s Thames & Hudson paperback series, with their masterly text and plentiful but small and hard-to-see photographs in black and white, and expensive volumes with magnificent photos, mostly relegated to academic libraries. That’s all changed, largely because of the Internet, where high-resolution photographs of individual vases — on academic and curatorial websites with expert analysis, certainly, but also on the Flickr accounts of museumgoing tourists — let you zoom in on the tiny details in which much of the delight of Greek vase painting lies. But the lower cost of printing has also put beautifully printed large-format books within reach, and for readers getting interested in Greek vases for the first time, a coherent illustrated overview of the subject is invaluable and much more manageable on the page than on-screen."
Paris-London,2013-12-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Jonathan Conlin offers a series of strolls through the history of Paris and London.,"When it comes to frills and fashions, London defers to Paris. It was ever so. Jonathan Conlin, the American-born author of an admired history of London’s National Gallery, starts his series of sprightly strolls through these two great cities by imagining the journey of a “fashion doll,” a child-size mannequin that could be kitted out in the latest Paris style and brought back via Calais or Ostend for an astute dressmaker to use as her model when arraying London’s titled fashion lovers. The first such doll crossed the Channel — ready for the latest take on wimples, ladies? — in the 14th century. Prudently, the author confines his study in cultural crossings to the two centuries leading up to the Great War."
Muppet Man,2013-12-06,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Puppets', 'Television']",A biography of the puppeteer whose influence has hardly waned in the more than two decades since his death.,"It’s not easy being a puppeteer. Consider the opening sequence of 1979’s “The Muppet Movie,” in which Kermit the Frog performed “The Rainbow Connection,” the ­follow-up to his breakout number, “Bein’ Green.” Kermit strummed his banjo while perched on a log in the middle of a swamp. The set had been carefully constructed on a studio back lot, but even fake swamps have real water. This required Jim Henson, Kermit’s creator and performer, to execute the complicated sequence submerged. As Kermit crooned, Henson lurked beneath the surface of the ersatz bayou, his lanky frame folded into a ­custom-made diving bell, his oxygen pumped in through a tube. To make his frog sing, the puppeteer had to become amphibious. "

Composers,2013-12-06,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Classical Music', 'Music']","A new book about Richard Wagner, who relentlessly recorded his daily life, and another about Bach, who left hardly any paper trail.","On Jan. 1, 1869, the mother of two of Richard Wagner’s children, though not quite yet his wife, began keeping a diary. Though, calling the 14-year account that Cosima Wagner eventually produced a diary is like calling a battleship a boat. At the start of his idiosyncratic new book, “Richard Wagner: A Life in Music,” Martin Geck notes that Cosima’s journals ended up running nearly one million words. Full of mythologizing and after-the-fact edits, they give us, in conjunction with Wagner’s own copious writing and correspondence, an unprecedented opportunity: For no other cultural figure of his significance do we have a record of daily life so relentlessly extensive."
The Chelsea,2013-12-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Sherill Tippins aims to tell the definitive story of New York’s Hotel Chelsea in “Inside the Dream Palace.”,"“It’s a sad irony of New York life that over time, the fabled buildings and institutions that first attract us to the city fade into invisibility.” So begins Sherill Tippins’s thorough, if not groundbreaking, Hotel Chelsea history. For the past dozen or so years, the Chelsea has been raging against invisibility. Former guests and residents as different as Dee Dee Ramone, Abel Ferrara and Ethan Hawke have featured it in their work. Current residents have waged a very public battle with its recent owners. In anticipation of a potentially soul-killing renovation, two new books capture its lovably scuzzy spirit. One is an evocative coffee-table book by the photographer Victoria Cohen, HOTEL CHELSEA (Pointed Leaf Press, $95), which treats the oddly painted rooms’ quirky mix of old and new furniture, worn carpeting and garish bedspreads as something like sacred relics. The other is Tippins’s doorstop-hefty ­“Inside the Dream Palace,” which aspires to tell the “definitive story.”"

Nasty stuff of this sort may resurface after years of psychoanalysis or — less therapeutically if more efficiently — in the course of a compact, elegantly constructed ghost story, which happens to be one of Hill’s specialties. Her nerve-­shaking 1983 novel “The Woman in Black” is a modern classic of the genre, in the whispery manner of M. R. James and Robert Aickman.

As the bespectacled grandfather padded around his 16th-century palazzo, pointing out curiosities like a gilded sedan chair and silver medical tools, he appeared more likely to offer me a cup of tea than slay anyone in the name of Christ. And yet that is the sort of thing Mr. de Piro’s order, the Knights of Malta (officially the Sovereign Hospitaller Order of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta), were known for in their heyday. Drawn from the most noble families of Europe, they left their homelands, took vows of chastity and obedience and dedicated themselves to fighting infidels.

A Singer Is Part of the Big Picture,2013-12-06,article,News,,['Music'],Cécile McLorin Salvant is the latest answer to the question of what jazz has to do with you.,"Recently, a 25-foot-tall photograph of the jazz singer Cécile McLorin Salvant has been on view outside the main entrance to Jazz at Lincoln Center, at 60th Street and Broadway.

But it’s not surprising that Jazz at Lincoln Center should want to go out on a limb to promote her. Though she writes her own songs, she puts original, idiosyncratic and virtuosic force on old repertory, some of it from the high era of American songbook standards, some of it older than jazz itself.

(HBO) STOKER (2013) In his English-language debut, the South Korean director Park Chan-wook (“Oldboy,” “Lady Vengeance”) tells the story of India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska), a solitary Connecticut teenager embroiled in a landscape of family secrets, sexual subtext and aristocratic entitlement after her father (Dermot Mulroney) dies in a car accident on her 18th birthday. Then her handsome Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew, comes to visit her mother (Nicole Kidman, above left, with Ms. Wasikowska), who seems insufficiently grief-stricken to her daughter. That’s when the family’s housekeeper (Phyllis Somerville) disappears, and a worried relative (Jacki Weaver) alludes to further danger ahead. “A great deal of information has been withheld, perhaps from India and certainly from us, and Mr. Park, with sadistic relish, takes his time with revelations that are both ghastly and a bit disappointing,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The exquisite sense of mystery that has built up around India begins to dissipate as the focus shifts to Charlie, and tantalizing ambiguities are resolved into a tale of madness and murder.” Which, he added, “is not so bad, though the final act of ‘Stoker’ walks a fine line between the sensational and the silly.” Learning the truth about Charlie, Mr. Scott said, “does not so much explain what had come before as turn everything upside down, scattering the puzzle pieces in a colorful, brutal cascade.” The actor Wentworth Miller (“Prison Break”) wrote the screenplay."

What’s On Sunday,2013-12-08,article,Schedule,,[],"What’s On Sunday, December 8, 2013","9 P.M. (A&E, History, Lifetime) BONNIE & CLYDE Bruce Beresford puts his spin on the doomed love affair of the 1930s gangsters Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in this two-night mini-series starring Holliday Grainger and Emile Hirsch. William Hurt portrays Frank Hamer, the retired Texas Ranger who led the team that killed Parker and Barrow in 1934. Holly Hunter (above left, with Ms. Grainger) plays Parker’s mother. “Mr. Beresford (‘Tender Mercies,’ ‘Driving Miss Daisy’) gives the sentimental material a corresponding autumnal glow, and there are sweeping, lovely images of Texas fields under big skies, a shimmering crescent moon and an oil refinery sparkling in the night,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Comparing Mr. Beresford’s work to Arthur Penn’s 1967 film with Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, Mr. Hale adds: “In the end, ‘Bonnie & Clyde’ has the one thing in common with ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ that you’d expect: the fusillade of machine-gun fire, and Barrow and Parker’s bodies twitching and bursting as they’re torn apart. While it doesn’t have the force of Penn’s brutal choreography, it’s a surprisingly graphic scene for basic cable. Less surprising is a gratuitous, last-minute plot twist that serves to cement the film’s portrayal of Barrow as a tragic, star-crossed hero. Apparently, only the misunderstood die young.” "

Long revered for “Maus,” his Pulitzer Prize-winning concentration camp epic (published in two parts in 1986 and 1991), the artist’s work is broader than many realize, as his retrospective at the Jewish Museum in New York (through March 23, 2014) reveals. The show, which has already appeared in Europe and Canada, includes Spiegelman’s early Wacky Pack and Garbage Pail Kids sketches, and closes with more recent projects, like a performance he choreographed and designed with the dance troupe Pilobolus and a colored-glass window representing an art student’s life that he made for his alma mater, the High School of Art & Design in New York. In October, Spiegelman published his monograph, “Co-Mix” (Drawn & Quarterly), and premiered his hybrid slide-show-talk-concert “Wordless!,” which focuses on the woodcut novels of early-20th-century artists like Lynd Ward, at the Sydney Opera House.

Three’s a Trend | Art That’s All About the Money … Literally,2013-12-10,article,News,,['Art'],"To play on the perception that contemporary art has been completely commoditized, some clever young artists are using currency as a raw material.","On paper, art is a lot like money. The value of an art object has almost nothing to do with the time required to make it, and even less to do with its materials; if counterfeit, its worth is nil. So it’s no wonder that some physical artists in a disembodied world are — like Warhol in the plastic age or Rihanna in “Pour It Up” — all about the benjamins. At this year’s Art Basel in Miami Beach, Scott Campbell (OHWOW Gallery) showed sculptures built with greenbacks and Hugh Scott-Douglas (Blum & Poe) manipulated foreign currency in a set of his signature magnified scans. Meanwhile, over at NADA, Robert Wechsler (China Art Objects Galleries) exhibited perfectly symmetrical cubes constructed from spare change. In a time of relentless secondary-market speculation that turns young artists into stocks just waiting to be cashed in, it’s almost as if the artists themselves are turning around and saying: “Happy now?”"

Early in his career, Russell developed a reputation as a brilliant but difficult director; George Clooney said the two actually came to blows on the set of Russell’s third film, “Three Kings,” and later a YouTube video circulated of Lily Tomlin and Russell in a full-throated, expletive-laced shouting match on the set of his fourth film, “I Heart Huckabees.” Whether­ the characterization was fair, Russell has since undergone a personal, artistic and, ultimately, professional transformation. He regards “Hustle,” a highly fictionalized version of the Abscam scandal of the late ’70s and early ’80s, as the third in a loose trilogy of films about ordinary people trying to live passionate lives. It’s a journey he has had some experience with firsthand."

What’s on Thursday,2013-12-12,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9:30 A.M. (Starz) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In Woody Allen’s tribute to the Italian cinema of the 1950s and ’60s, a retired and overly psychoanalyzed music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to a lawyer devoted to left-wing causes (Flavio Parenti). Meanwhile, in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and falls into the arms of a movie star while her befuddled husband tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penélope Cruz) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) in shreds when her neurotic actress friend visits. Alec Baldwin plays the older architect — a ghost? a specter of the younger man’s self? — who witnesses the ordeal. “One of the most delightful things about ‘To Rome With Love’ is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The movie’s limitations, “as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights.” Complaining, he added, “would be as superfluous — though also, perhaps, as inevitable — as psychoanalysis.”"

L. Travers.","“Saving Mr. Banks,” released by Disney, is a movie about the making of a Disney movie (“Mary Poppins”), in which Walt Disney himself (played by Tom Hanks) is a major character. It includes a visit to Disneyland and, if you look closely, a teaser for its companion theme park in Florida (as yet unbuilt, when the story takes place). A large Mickey Mouse plush toy appears from time to time to provide an extra touch of humor and warmth. But it would be unfair to dismiss this picture, directed by John Lee Hancock from a script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, as an exercise in corporate self-promotion. It’s more of a mission statement."

This is by design. Set entirely inside a Brooklyn brownstone — with a brief trip to the backyard — this gendered gabfest has been constructed along familiar LaButian lines. A man and a woman pace like inmates, jawing and clawing and drawing metaphoric (or not) blood, and then Mr. LaBute, rather like a mean O. Henry, tosses in a detonating surprise that either changes what you’ve thought until that moment or ticks you off.

Luc Bondy’s bleak “Tosca” has been part of the Metropolitan Opera’s repertory since 2009, when it opened the season to lusty booing. That was due in great part to the grim sets, which have none of the historical detail of the Franco Zeffirelli production. Only bare brick walls and what appear to be Ikea folding chairs offer respite for a viewer tired of puzzling over that Lucian Freud painting that has somehow found its way into the church, perhaps dumped there by Napoleonic troops after an art looting expedition into the future. Also missing in Mr. Bondy’s “Tosca” are the crucifix and candles she places on and around the body of the villainous Scarpia after she has stabbed him to death."

What’s On Tuesday,2013-12-17,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"11:30 A.M. (MoreMax) ANNA KARENINA (2012) Keira Knightley (above) stars as Anna, the bored wife of a virtuous government official (Jude Law) in mid-19th-century Imperial Russia, who travels from St. Petersburg to Moscow to calm a marital storm in the household of her philandering brother (Matthew Macfadyen) in Joe Wright’s stagy adaptation of this Tolstoy novel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the man who captures her heart: Count Vronsky, a young military officer with the eyes of a poet and a domineering mother (Olivia Williams). And Alicia Vikander is Kitty, a lovely young woman adored by Levin, the gloomy rural landowner (Domhnall Gleeson) widely understood to be Tolstoy’s alter ego, whose idea of love — an ennobling union of souls — is a rebuke to the amorality festering in cities. “I assume you know that it ends badly, but Mr. Wright’s real interest, like Tolstoy’s, is in everything that happens in between Anna’s first meeting with Vronsky and her final encounter with the wheels of a train,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And while Mr. Wright’s screen versions of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” and Ian McEwan’s “Atonement” “remain trapped in literariness,” he added, “Mr. Wright’s ‘Anna Karenina’ is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly — wonderfully — crazy terms. Pious Tolstoyans may knit their brows about the stylistic liberties Mr. Wright and the screenwriter, Tom Stoppard, have taken, but surely Tolstoy can withstand (and may indeed benefit from) their playful, passionate rendering of his masterpiece.” Jacqueline Durran won an Oscar for costume design."

In 1987, Jordan Belfort — a.k.a. the wolf himself — took a job at L. F. Rothschild, an old white-shoe firm. It was his first job in the business, and he was given the assignment of cold-calling “prospects” that he would then turn over to a broker. In his memoir — upon which the movie is based — Mr. Belfort claims, among other things, that a successful Rothschild broker (played by Matthew McConaughey on screen) took him to lunch on his first day and told him to masturbate often if he hoped to be a good broker himself. Given Rothschild’s stodgy reputation, I tend to think this story is an exaggeration, an act of salesmanship intended to lure in Hollywood. No matter. Not long after Mr. Belfort began working for L. F. Rothschild, the crash of 1987 wiped out the firm and took his job with it."

Backward to Somewhere,2013-12-19,article,Review,,['Movies'],"“The Past,” the new film from the Iranian director of “A Separation,” looks at a range of personal struggles in suburban Paris.","The modest, run-down home at the center of “The Past” is filled with rooms that — much like the characters who are busily, sometimes leisurely passing through them — somehow feel cut off from one another. Set in a characterless Paris suburb that’s as physically and psychically distant from the City of Light as the moon, the movie is both a family melodrama and a relationship story, which perhaps inevitably means it’s about love and loyalty, secrets and lies, and how the past, never being dead, just hovers around waiting to smack us upside the head. All this also makes it something of a haunted house movie, except that its characters are plagued by ghosts of their own design. "

So it goes at N.Y.U.’s Skirball Center, where “Cirkopolis,” the latest body-twisting delight from the Montreal neo-circus troupe Cirque Eloize, is in residency through Jan. 5. The show begins with a single man, a beaten-down bureaucrat in business drab, stamping papers at a desk before giant projections of rotating industrial cogs, à la “Metropolis.” It sounds like the scene is being set for some Weimar-tinged exploration of the alienation of the human worker. Not quite. Those Bauhaus facades are a mere backdrop for a dazzling display of human bodily levitation, contortion and gyration. The acrobats defy gravity in jaw-dropping performances on giant wheel-like contraptions, atop one another’s bodies, suspended from trapezes and ropes, and, astoundingly, up and down a 100-foot pole at frenetic speeds. It’s hard not to deliver an ovation when a pretty young woman in a fluttery red dress whirls inside a massive hula hoop, like a human dreidel."

The commission went to Frederick William MacMonnies, an American sculptor trained in the Beaux-Arts who lived in France. MacMonnies proposed a multitiered fountain topped by the figure of an Indian chief, but local citizens objected to celebrating a recently feared and despised enemy. So MacMonnies offered instead a sculpture of the all-around frontiersman Kit Carson (1809-68), who, to this day, appears in bronze riding a rearing horse at the summit of the Pioneer Monument in downtown Denver."

Although the subject is a worthy one — Sonnabend was among the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century — the show is a byproduct of legal hassles and diplomatic campaigns surrounding her billion-dollar estate, which may be one reason it feels, as a tribute, cool and impersonal, a portrait-in-art that is only a sketch."

Confusing poets’ lives with their work is an illusion as old as the tradition of confusing words with objects. But in fact it is for the sake of this illusion that we feel such a strong need for poetry, for novels, for literature. There are some poets whose work we read with their lives in mind, and what we know of those lives ensures that their poetry leaves a more enduring impression. C. P. Cavafy is, for me, just such a poet.

He enrolled in art school to become an illustrator in the footsteps of Howard Pyle and N. C. Wyeth, just as the Armory Show of 1913 was about to usher in the avant-garde and relegate illustration — art as storytelling — to the back pages. He was a loner, did not feel close to his parents or brother, was not a devoted father to his three sons. He was married to his work; his three wives, Irene O’Connor, Mary Barstow and Molly Punderson, learned to accommodate.

Chicago’s Opportunity Artist,2013-12-20,article,News,,['Art'],Can the social sculptor Theaster Gates turn the inner city into art?,"Six blocks from where I grew up, on Chicago’s South Side, the artist Theaster Gates showed me a neo-Classical ruin, a Prohibition-era bank shuttered for 33 years that I only ever registered vaguely as a part of the area’s enduring blight. “That’s my bank,” he announced with a flourish, pointing proudly to its glazed terra cotta and its ornamental eaves. Maybe it requires an artist to picture the possibilities in such a wreck, or a real estate developer to envision its promise. Gates, 40, is both at the same time, an enormous dreamer canny enough to make his outlandish ideas for the neighborhood a reality. When the bank was days from demolition, Gates spoke with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose brother, Ari, owns several Gates pieces; the city agreed to sell the abandoned building to Gates for $1, with the stipulation that he come up with the $3.7 million necessary for its renovation. A portion of that money, Gates devised, would be made from the bank’s original marble, which he cut into individual “bond certificates” engraved with an image of the building, his signature and the words “In ART We Trust.” He created 100 tablet-size bonds, selling them for $5,000 apiece; larger slabs, as weighty as tombstones, went for $50,000. Because they’re works of art, Gates told me, the marble will actually increase in value, functioning like real bonds. “So, yeah, it’s a bank! The bank should continue to make currency. I want it to have a banking function.”"

Who Made That Smoke Alarm?,2013-12-20,article,News,,"['Smoke Detectors', 'Inventions and Patents']",From an inexpensive lifesaver to a universal source of irritation.,"In the early 1960s, Duane Pearsall tinkered in his engineering lab with a machine he called a “static neutralizer” — an ion generator designed to control static electricity in factories and photo labs. But when one of his technicians lit up a cigarette, a meter measuring the ions went haywire. Pearsall realized he’d just hit on a low-cost, low-power method for sniffing smoke. During the next decade, he and his team developed the SmokeGard, which hung from the ceiling and made a noxious noise whenever it sensed a fire. Soon, smoke detectors were in most homes in America and had saved hundreds of lives. Yet they could also be irritating. “You have no way of knowing whether it’s operational unless you set fire to your house,” wrote one newspaper humorist in 1977 of a cheap smoke detector he bought in a local store. “Merely holding the smoke detector in your lap while you watch Farrah Fawcett-Majors is not a true test.”"

A Historian in Camelot,2013-12-20,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'United States Politics and Government']","Arthur Schlesinger Jr.’s letters reveal he was no ivory-tower scholar, but an enthusiastic partisan.","Most intellectuals are attracted to power, but none with less ambivalence than Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the brilliant historian of the New Deal who became the quasi-official chronicler of the Kennedys. Schlesinger was born into an American aristocracy in its prime — the Eastern liberal intelligentsia. He was the son of an eminent Harvard historian and grew up apparently knowing everyone. He met his first Kennedy (sister Rosemary, before her lobotomy) when he was 14, at a Christmas party in 1931. It was natural, maybe even inevitable, that Schlesinger, while serving as an intelligence officer in Germany at the end of the war, would be invited to dinner “at the palatial mansion shared by George Ball and Ken Galbraith.” In Washington after the war, the young author of “The Age of Jackson” had a place at the table of Georgetown dinner parties thrown by the columnist Joseph Alsop, where he met Democratic Party royalty — Averell Harriman (“quite favorably impressed by him”), Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. (“looks astonishingly like his father and has adopted many of his mannerisms”) and John F. Kennedy (“seemed very sincere and not unintelligent, but kind of on the conservative side”). "

Inside the List,2013-12-20,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Joe Stefko, a former drummer for Meat Loaf, has been printing limited editions of Dean Koontz’s novels for more than 20 years.","The Limited: Hardcovers, paperbacks, ­e-books — the combined lists include them all. But what about collectible limited editions, wherein a specialty publisher produces a small run of books to an exacting standard, often by hand? (Think of the old leather-bound Franklin Library titles, for example.) The Times doesn’t track those, since by their nature they sell in numbers too small to register. That doesn’t mean they never intersect with the best-seller lists, though. One such publisher is Joe Stefko, the owner of Charnel House books in Catskill, N.Y., who for more than 20 years has printed limited editions of Dean Koontz’s novels. Stefko, 58, a former drummer for Meat Loaf, got interested in fine books when he played with the Turtles. “Other bands had drug dealers coming to their dressing rooms,” he told a music fan site some years ago, “and we had book dealers coming to ours.” As you’d guess from its name — and its address, P.O. Box 666 — Charnel House specializes in horror, and Stefko has designed covers with protruding fangs (for Christopher Moore), real bullets (for Stephen King) and deep fingernail gouges (for Tim Powers). “These are commercial books,” he told me in a phone interview, “but I turn them into fine art.”"

(In 2012, a blizzard ground the city to a halt, and Romans are still talking about it with wide-eyed amazement.) My daughter can’t possibly remember the winters of her New York babyhood, but suddenly, about six months ago, she began to ask me when the snow would come. When would we play in the snow? Where was the snow hiding? I could only guess she was exhibiting a child’s sixth sense for wonder: Snow is a portal out of the ordinary churn of life, forcing even grown-ups to go out and play. Coincidentally, and luckily for my daughter, three new picture books herald the majesty of snow, bringing its almost magically transformative power to any child who yearns for it."

A Law Unto Himself,2013-12-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"The most notorious operative of Pinkerton’s detective agency, James McParland was a thorn in the sides of unions and outlaws.","The lobby of the Idanha Hotel in Boise, Idaho, was the scene of great excitement in the spring and summer of 1907.

Behind him, guarding against the threat of assassination, stood a former cowboy, armed with a Colt .45 and a 20-inch blade hidden inside a walking stick. “Most pass by with awed looks,” a witness wrote, “while some few are proud to be seen sitting alongside and basking in the great man’s halo.” One of those who stopped to stare was the actress Ethel Barrymore, in town with a touring company. The object of curiosity introduced himself: “I’m a Pinkerton man.”"

This rage may have started as a red-hot boil, but the best of these writers don’t approach the page until the original insult has cooled and the words crackle like ice. Personally, I find these folks terrifying. I like to read them, but I’m not so sure I want to know them. Their humor is barbed, their policy, scorched earth. So let’s just say that if I were to catch a glimpse of Bruce Wagner — the grumpy, gimlet-eyed, savagely funny chronicler of all things West Coast — across a crowded room, I’d likely slink out the door.

In Greg Baxter’s pellucid first novel, “The Apartment,” it may be simply the length of a day — but a day in which one travels surprisingly far, literally and figuratively. Baxter, whose only previous book is a work of nonfiction, “A Preparation for Death,” which details his implosion and rebirth as a writer and a person, has written a novel of subtle beauty and quiet grace; I found myself hanging on every simple word, as tense about the consequences of a man finding an apartment as if I were reading about a man defusing a bomb. And, possibly, that is what “The Apartment” is as well: the analysis of an explosion deferred, or narrowly avoided, a hairbreadth escape. It is one of the best novels I have read in a long time."

What’s On Friday,2013-12-27,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"1:45 P.M. (IFC) THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD (2007) Andrew Dominik directed this contemplative portrait of the final days of the outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt, above) and his gang (Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and others).

(Anchor, $15.95.) In 1859, Paul Du Chaillu emerged from a four-year hunting expedition in Gabon with a major zoological discovery: 20 preserved skins of a massive ape, which soon took its familiar name — gorilla.

Bullet Diplomacy,2013-12-27,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Cold War Era']",Michael Burleigh surveys many of the international wars and anticolonial insurgencies during two decades of the Cold War.,"In “Small Wars, Faraway Places,” Michael Burleigh recounts the violent end of the British and French empires in Africa and Asia, and their partial replacement by the United States in its often ill-informed and costly efforts to combat Communism during the early stages of the Cold War. Burleigh surveys many of the major international wars and anticolonial insurgencies between 1945 and 1965, but opts to focus most on those involving America, Britain and France, and how they related to the rivalry with the Soviet Union. The result is a well-researched and readable account of two tumultuous decades. Burleigh judges most of these wars, both small and large, to have been futile and destructive. But while he clearly has no interest in defending or rehabilitating such conflicts, he nonetheless offers a fair, thoughtful assessment of the motives and interests behind them. He also takes care to understand and explain the grievances of the insurgents."
Man Against Nature,2013-12-27,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']","A biography of Jack London, whose fictional characters lived in a determined universe.","“The superficial reader will get the love story & the adventure,” Jack London wrote, in 1903, of the story that would become “The Sea-Wolf,” “while the deeper reader will get all of this, plus the bigger thing lying underneath.” These are the typically blunt words of a writer who seemed to think of his work in terms of purchase value. Here, he might have been describing his own life: much adventure, a sort of love story, a weird bang of a finish. In a new biography by the London scholar Earle Labor, the “bigger thing” has a harder time coming out: Perhaps it doesn’t exist."
Stealth Maneuvers,2013-12-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Frederick Busch’s plain-spoken stories culminate in often unsettling realizations.,"Imagine the writer as a wager of war. Some stun with shock-and-awe prose, surprise plot twists, barrages of literary ordnance. Others deploy steady blasts of sentiment, turning heartstrings into so many tripwires. But some conduct a subtler campaign, built on stealth maneuvers: escalating schemes, deft and imperceptible, that quietly, thrillingly, devastate. ­Frederick Busch, the author of more than two dozen books, who died in 2006 at the age of 64, was a master of this approach. "
Close Quarters,2013-12-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Sam Thompson’s first novel puts urban life under a microscope.,"It is tempting to call “Communion Town” a novel about a city. But neither “novel” nor “city” quite captures the eerie multi­dimensionality of Sam Thompson’s dazzling debut; everything about “Communion Town” — from its genre to its subject to its shifting perspectives — proves to be more complicated than it seems. At the end of the book, the city remains as hazy to readers as shadows on the walls of a cave. What “Communion Town” renders with stunning and often heartbreaking lucidity is the complexity of consciousness itself. "
Guests of the Ayatollah,2013-12-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An Iranian-American recounts his yearlong sojourn in Tehran.,"To write about one’s country while living in another is to invite questions about loyalty. Why are you writing this? And for whom? The questions can take an ominous tone: What is your agenda? The journalist Hooman Majd faced such suspicions on one of his trips to Tehran, when an employee from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance told him bluntly: “Just because you have an Iranian passport doesn’t mean you can come here and write whatever you want when you leave.”"
Little Angels,2013-12-27,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Psychology and Psychologists']",The Yale psychologist Paul Bloom mines child-development research for insights into morality.,"Is morality innate? In his new book, “Just Babies,” the psychologist Paul Bloom draws from his research at the Yale Infant Cognition Center to argue that “certain moral foundations are not acquired through learning. . . . They are instead the products of biological evolution.” Infants may be notoriously difficult to study (rats and pigeons “can at least run mazes or peck at levers”), but according to Bloom, they are, in fact, “moral creatures.”"

The scene is London, last March: A small cluster of paparazzi is egging Mr. Bieber on, and he takes the bait, jumping at the photographers and being held back by a bodyguard. At least half of the conversation (on both sides) is bleeped."

But in the interests of inclusiveness — and, O.K., advance planning before the holidays — I wondered what our 10 best authors would pick as their favorites. So I asked them. The rules were simple: Tell us the best book you read this year (whether it was published in 2013 or not) and, briefly, describe it. Not everybody responded — I wasn’t the only one beleaguered by sugarplums — but enough did to devote the column this week, and next, to their replies: the best books as chosen by the authors of the best books, a sort of chain letter of terrific reading ideas.

There is one exception: Christmastime. Because studios release so many pictures in such short order and so many moviegoers are on vacation, initial grosses can be deceptive; films that look soft can find their footing or fall off sharply.

Basically, the standard models say that output fluctuates around a normal level, with the ups and downs equal in size, and that all policy can do is reduce the variance. Fatas believes, however, that the business cycle is better seen as occasional drops below potential output, then returns to trend — a view that makes good policy much more important. I agree.

Perls, has been dismissed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The suit claimed that Perls and his family held on to hundreds of Calder’s works, cheated the artist’s estate out of tens of millions of dollars over the course of three decades and sold fake Calder works. According to the decision by Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich, made public last week, the various claims are “an incoherent stew of irrelevance and innuendo” and the evidence failed to show that any fraud had been committed. “All these allegations are so patently inadequate that the court can only conclude that they were brought solely for the purpose of harassment or embarrassment,” Judge Kornreich said. The lawsuit was filed in 2010, two years after Mr. Perls died. His wife, Dolly, and employees of his gallery have also died. Calder died in 1976, leaving Judge Kornreich to conclude, “Plaintiffs are attempting to litigate issues that necessarily stretch back decades without any personal knowledge or contemporaneous records, where nearly all of the people who had personal knowledge of the facts of the case are dead.” Perls represented Calder for more than 20 years, and they were considered friends who frequently dined and traveled together and visited each other’s families.

Cocktail Culture | A Bubbly Twist on the Negroni,2013-12-30,article,News,,[],"This version of the classic Italian drink substitutes dry sparkling wine for gin, which makes for a lighter libation that’s easier to drink and is perfect for the holidays.","When a bartender at Bar Basso in Milan mistakenly grabbed a bottle of spumante instead of gin while making a Negroni (comprised of the holy trinity of the cocktail world: Campari, Italian vermouth and gin), he inadvertently created a simple, endlessly drinkable twist on a classic: the Negroni Sbagliato (“sbagliato” is Italian for “mistaken”). By substituting effervescent wine for the piney, citrusy sweetness of gin, he’d somehow stripped the Negroni down to its essence. Sbagliatos retain that pleasing chalkiness and minerality of Campari and the herby qualities of vermouth, but these flavors stretch out across the bubbles and somehow lead one to drink more slowly, savoring the medley. Unlike Negronis, which are all booze but taste like adult candy, Sbagliatos are less likely to put one’s party-appropriate sobriety at risk. But if they do wind up going down a little too quickly, rest easy — the Sbagliato is significantly lower in alcohol by volume than its brawnier big brother, a key consideration in the holiday marathon drinking season."
