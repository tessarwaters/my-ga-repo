(13) BILLY PORTER: BROADWAY AND SOUL Mr. Porter — who won several awards as the drag queen Lola, above, in the Broadway musical “Kinky Boots” — performs jazz-inflected standards from the American Songbook in this “Live From Lincoln Center” presentation. As he transformed “Take the Moment,” an obscure song from the Richard Rodgers-Stephen Sondheim musical “Do I Hear a Waltz?,” into a pop-gospel plea, “his performance created the kind of epiphany that a great voice can conjure out of thin air,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The key lay not only in Mr. Porter’s innate vocal power but also in his commitment to shoot the moon, no matter the consequences.” But the evening’s coup was his reinvention of “Sunday,” from “Sunday in the Park With George,” as a church anthem, fusing Broadway and gospel traditions. “It was the kind of juxtaposition that probably only Mr. Porter could have pulled off,” Mr. Holden added, “and it struck deep.” In “Annie Lennox: Nostalgia Live in Concert,” at 10, Ms. Lennox puts her own spin on the genre with “Summertime,” “Strange Fruit,” “God Bless the Child” and other works in a “Great Performances” presentation taped at the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles."

Borecore,2015-04-03,article,News,,"['Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming']","The heart and soul of video-sharing apps isn’t the viral stuff. In fact, it’s the exact opposite.","The Vine videos that rise to the top of the heap typically feature dance routines, quick-cut pranks and the occasional clever stop-motion short. But if you tap into the video-sharing app’s raw “fire hose,” a different picture emerges. For example, VPeeker — a site that provides an unending stream of recent Vine uploads — reveals that buried beneath those popular Vines lies a less visible but more intriguing trend: six-second displays of normalcy. Rather than killing time at the mall, in a Spencer’s Gifts or the food court, young people are filming themselves doing the incredibly mundane: goofing around in a backyard pool, lounging on basement couches, whatever; in other words, recording the minutiae of their lives and uploading it for not very many to see. New services are stepping in too, offering the immediacy Vine cannot. There’s Meerkat, which lets people broadcast video feeds from their phones of what they’re doing at any particular moment. There’s YouNow, which is like Meerkat but primarily the domain of teenagers, who use it to stream video of themselves, bored, at home, in their bedrooms. (For now, it’s totally innocent.) A cynic might dismiss all this obsessive self-documentation as evidence of generational narcissism, but you could just as easily choose to view it as a developing global pastime. Call it borecore: the never-to-be-viral output that comes from mixing powerful devices and a lifetime of social-­media training with regular, old teenage boredom. Seen this way, its predecessors are more prosaic than pathological: doodling in a composition notebook, making scrapbooks, driving around aimlessly. But that simplicity, that sameness, can feel magical when you binge on it: a series of furtive glimpses into the lives of people across the country and around the world doing a whole lot of nothing. Though the technology available to us has far exceeded our wildest imaginations, it’s still perfectly suited to filling those moments when our imaginations just won’t do."

In Thomas’s first memoir, “Safekeeping,” she wrote of being married three times, of having four children, of the death of her father and her second ex-husband, and about meeting her third husband, Rich. In “A Three Dog Life,” a moving encounter with grief, we learned about the traffic accident that left the unfortunate Rich brain damaged and cared for in a nursing home.

James Hannaham’s ‘Delicious Foods’,2015-04-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A boy searches for his young drug-addicted mother employed at a remote industrial farm.,"When readers first meet Eddie, one of the principal characters in James Hannaham’s much anticipated second novel, he is struggling to steer a stolen vehicle out of Louisiana and north up Interstate 45, to where he’s told his aunt and longtime protector now lives, in St. Cloud, Minn., a place whose very name sounds to him like heaven after the hell he has just endured. Eddie has no hands. How exactly he came to have them severed, a final act of desperation in a novel singularly focused on desperate acts, isn’t revealed until the end. But one thing becomes brutally apparent from the start: Eddie’s mother, Darlene, is overtaken by drug addiction born out of grief over the early, violent death of Eddie’s black activist father, Nat — and her clouded judgment leads to any number of miseries for herself and her son. When she is tempted in her stupor into a van and into a contract with a company called Delicious Foods, which also gives the novel its title, she is secreted away to a camp where she is forced to work, in order to pay off the debt of her room and food and the diet of crack cocaine overseers use to keep their slave laborers subdued. The drug so utterly annihilates Darlene’s autonomy that it speaks for her, narrating her portions of the novel as “Scotty” — a sinister, wiseass monologuist who often sounds like a cross between Katt Williams and the Devil himself."

The first two survived these debilitating attachments, the third did not. At the age of 43, upon learning that her common law husband of 14 years had secretly married a 22-year-old actress, Eleanor took poison and died. Had her father, Karl Marx, been alive he would have been not only distressed by her death but, I think, dismayed that a daughter of his could not surmount this level of betrayal, for the sake of international socialism if nothing else."
Inside the List,2015-04-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Ayaan Hirsi Ali, whose “Heretic” is No. 8 on the hardcover nonfiction list, applied for work with left-leaning think tanks when she moved to America in 2007, but found no takers.","The Reformer: At least since the frenzied days after 9/11, some pundits have called on moderate Muslims to criticize the more extreme elements of their faith from within. Ayaan Hirsi Ali would seem to fit the bill: Born in Somalia to a Muslim family, she fled to the Netherlands rather than submit to a forced marriage, and has since been vocal in chastising radical Islam for its embrace of violence as well as its treatment of women, gay people and nonbelievers; in short, she’d like to see Islam evolve to become more secular and ecumenical. (She outlined much of this agenda, along with her life story, in the 2007 book “Infidel,” which spent seven months on the hardcover and paperback nonfiction lists.) So it’s been interesting to see just how polarizing Hirsi Ali — whose new book, “Heretic,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8 — has turned out to be. A professed liberal, she applied for work with left-leaning think tanks when she moved to America in 2007, but found no takers. “They didn’t say it to my face, but I got the feeling that they were uncomfortable with what I had been saying about Islam,” she told the author Sam Harris last year. Instead she found a home with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, which seems at peace with her message that Islam is a religion of war. “Muslims regard any ‘insult’ to the Prophet or the Quran as deserving the ultimate penalty,” she writes in “Heretic” — which makes the case for an Islamic Reformation — “and this is not an extreme position.” To her critics, Hirsi Ali may lack nuance: In fighting fervor with fervor, she can seem less like a moderate Muslim than an immoderate anti-Muslim. (In fact, as she explained in “Infidel,” she is now an atheist.) Then again, lack of nuance has never hurt a book’s success. Isn’t that part of Hirsi Ali’s argument, after all?"

What’s On TV Monday,2015-04-06,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8:10 P.M. (Starz Cinema) THE LUNCHBOX (2014) When a delivery service sends a lunch intended for her husband astray, a neglected Mumbai housewife (Nimrat Kaur, above left, with Yashvi Puneet Nagar) finds herself communicating through handwritten letters and home-cooked meals with a widowed office worker (Irrfan Khan) nearing retirement in this debut feature from Ritesh Batra. “This is not a new conceit,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, citing “You’ve Got Mail” and “The Shop Around the Corner.” But, he wrote, “the idea of two lonely souls connecting in a vast, modern metropolis, and remaining strangers even as their intimacy grows, has a durable charm. As do Mr. Khan and Ms. Kaur, islands of melancholy calm surrounded by silliness and noise. Their performances are not exactly subtle — nothing in ‘The Lunchbox’ is exactly subtle — but they are graceful and dignified in the manner of movie stars in an earlier, less aggressive age, ennobling the ordinary lives they explore. And Mr. Batra makes their story touching and credible, an urban fable of hope in the face of disappointment.” "

Judge Marc T. Treadwell also asked Georgia corrections officials to produce all communications — “emails, correspondence, messages, etc.” — regarding Ms. Diamond’s transfer several weeks ago to Georgia State Prison. Ms. Diamond alleges that the transfer, to a prison with a relatively high prevalence of sexual violence, was “apparently retaliatory” for her lawsuit against corrections officials. Ms. Diamond, 36, is a nonviolent offender and first-time inmate who has lived as a transgender woman since adolescence, but has been held in prisons for men, most of them high-security, for the last three years. She claims in her lawsuit to have suffered at least seven sexual assaults as well as routine sexual coercion and harassment. In addition to safer housing, her lawsuit, filed in February, seeks access to the hormone therapy that is essential medical care for her gender dysphoria. She had been taking hormones for 17 years, she says, until the prison system denied her access. A Georgia corrections spokeswoman said on Monday that Ms. Diamond “has been receiving the appropriate treatment assessed by Georgia Correction Health medical staff” since March. This is apparently a reference to a hormone patch given to her in response to her lawsuit. "

Visually Arresting Graphic Rugs That Value Asymmetry (So as Not to Compete With God),2015-04-08,article,News,,[],A new limited-edition capsule collection by the art director Alex Proba and the textile designer Aelfie Oudghiri arrives at Shop Cooper Hewitt on Monday.,"The art director Alex Proba (of StudioProba, A Poster A Day and Kickstarter) and the rug and textile designer Aelfie Oudghiri (of Aelfie) are two of a kind — both create colorful, arrestingly graphic work; originally studied to be doctors in Europe; and are pillars of the collab-happy Brooklyn design community. And so one thing led to another, and a new series of limited-edition rugs and other decorative items, debuting Monday at Shop Cooper Hewitt, was born. The five rug styles ($1,675 each) and three pillow designs ($105 each), hand-dyed and -loomed in the Uttar Pradesh region of northern India, take cues from Kurdish weaving motifs and early Internet graphics, and feature hand-knotting techniques that make them look, Proba says, “more 3D than they actually are.” Many are asymmetrical, like the designs in Proba’s poster series: “That’s one of the reasons I was excited about her work, because you have to work at looking at it,” Oudghiri explains. “That’s a huge tenet of rug weaving; you keep things asymmetrical as a form of humility because you don’t want to compete with God.” And for those who might be, as Proba puts it, “afraid to commit” to the high-impact textiles, the shop will also be selling posters ($155) of the original flat designs."

Love and Loss,2015-04-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Two new picture books celebrate parental devotion, tinged with mortality.","In children’s books, parental love can be a surprisingly hot-potato subject. If a parent’s emotions seem somehow too enormous and complex, a book about endless devotion can end up striking many as unsettling rather than reassuring. Take the latest round of debate over Shel Silverstein’s classic “The Giving Tree.” Is the book’s depiction of all-in maternal self-sacrifice beautiful, or disturbing and patriarchal? Impassioned arguments persist on both sides. That split recalls similar objections to Robert Munsch’s “Love You Forever,” first published in 1986, which features a new mother rocking her baby and singing a little song that ends, “As long as I’m living / my baby you’ll be.” She repeats the song as she snuggles up to her child through his childhood and teenage years, and even when he is a grown man. Some see in the tale a straightforward, reassuring depiction of the boundlessness of a parent’s love. Others think it’s just too smothering and creepy, especially the way the woman crawls into her adult son’s bed."

(FX) THE COMEDIANS Billy Crystal is a comedy legend whose best work may be behind him and Josh Gad is a rising star in this new series, which ventures behind the scenes at “The Billy & Josh Show,” a semifictional late-night sketch series. Stephnie Weir plays the long-suffering producer caught between the men, who agree on almost nothing; Matt Oberg is the show’s head writer; and Megan Ferguson is the no-nonsense production assistant. “Semifake Billy and semifake Josh drop references to these real-life résumés constantly in ‘The Comedians’ as they try to one-up each other while battling over the show they’re supposed to be creating together,” Neil Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times. How meta is it? In Episode 4, Mel Brooks “advises his friend Billy not to try to book a big-name guest on ‘The Billy & Josh Show’ because it would distract the audience from the title characters. Mr. Brooks, of course, steals the episode.” In the Season 5 opener of “Louie,” at 10:30, Louie (Louis C.K.) admits in therapy that he’s not sure “how to live a life anymore” and encounters an angry lesbian at a school potluck. “This time around, as Louis C.K. reinvents the classic sitcom in his own elliptical, cerebral style, he seems to be in his absurdist theater phase, or his surrealist short-story phase — Kafka on the Hudson,” Mike Hale wrote in The Times. “His moments of victory, and redemption, come when he’s alone, onstage, working a funny voice and a dumb joke.”"

Ana Khouri’s Newest Jewelry Forms — to Accentuate a Woman’s Own,2015-04-09,article,News,,[],The designer introduces her latest pieces on live models today at Dover Street Market.,"The Brazilian designer Ana Khouri’s fine jewelry isn’t defined by carats, cut or color, nor by its high-profile fans, like Madonna and Jennifer Lawrence. Instead, she aims to distinguish her work by highlighting its natural synergy with the human anatomy. In her latest designs (she doesn’t create collections), the former art scholar and sculptor is taking that notion, of connecting the accessory to its wearer, even further. Today at Dover Street Market New York, she debuts collar necklaces, earrings, rings and bracelets made from materials like yellow gold, pavé diamonds and pearls. “I was inspired by a dialogue with the human form,” Khouri says. “The shapes of these pieces follow the lines of the body.” There are cuffs that appear to climb inside the ear and slink their way out of the lobe, and rings that “better frame the curves of the fingers.” Inspired by artists like Louise Bourgeois and Alberto Giacometti, Khouri explains that she aims to “call attention to the lines of the thing — and not the person who is wearing it.” To that effect, the DSMNY installation features live models, veiled and wearing the pieces over their fabric-draped skin — so that viewers only, as Khouri puts it, “focus only on what is essential.”"

How to Beat a Polygraph Test,2015-04-10,article,News,,"['Lying', 'Courts and the Judiciary']",Don’t be intimidated.

The first step is not to be intimidated. Most tests include two types of questions: relevant ones about a specific incident (“Did you leak classified information to The New York Times?”) and broader so-called control questions (“Have you ever lied to anyone who trusted you?”). The test assumes that an innocent person telling the truth will have a stronger reaction to the control questions than to the relevant ones. Before your test, practice deciphering between the two question types. “Go to the beach” when you hear a relevant question, Williams says. Calm yourself before answering by imagining gentle waves and warm sand."

Both parents were raised in the Christian Science faith, and they called a Christian Science practitioner, Jeanne Laitner, to pray for the child. Rita’s prior experience with an illness of her own is relevant to this choice: When repeated prayer “treatments” failed to give her relief from a painful ovarian cyst, she allowed physicians to operate. But she was viewed as having abandoned her faith. She was no longer permitted to lead church meetings or teach Sunday school. To Rita this loss of community was profound, and perhaps explains why, as her baby was getting worse, she did not seek medical care. "

David Treuer’s ‘Prudence’,2015-04-10,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An accidental killing sets off a tide of regret in David Treuer’s novel. ,"The poetics of damage permeates ­David Treuer’s elegantly bitter fourth novel, “Prudence,” which unites a distinctly modern sociopolitical perspective with a more old-fashioned moral rigor about the ­consequences of emotional cowardice, complicity and repression. On the evidence here, Treuer believes in bravery. Moreover, he believes that a lack of bravery isn’t just sad, it’s deeply destructive — and the destruction can’t be undone. Cowardice can kill people. While there’s much hope in this lyrical novel, as evidenced by the freedom with which it examines some of the more transgressive interstices of race, sexual orientation and gender, there’s also an obdurate insistence on taking responsibility, particularly if one is a man. Treuer’s perspective is bracingly tough. This ­author values honor. Who dares to take that kind of stance anymore?"

Susana Martinez signed a bill Friday virtually ending the practice of civil forfeiture, making the state a leader in sharply restricting a contentious policy.","Gov. Susana Martinez signed a bill Friday virtually ending the practice of civil forfeiture, making the state a leader in sharply restricting a contentious policy that critics say deprives citizens of due process and gives law enforcement a profit motive. “This is landmark legislation to protect people’s property and due process rights,” said Lee McGrath, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian civil rights group that has long campaigned against the practice. The law preserves criminal forfeiture, in which assets tied to crime can be taken if the owner is convicted. In a letter to lawmakers, Governor Martinez said the law improved constitutional protections even as she said that forfeiture funds had helped “in keeping our communities safe and in protecting our officers from harm.” Only one other state, North Carolina, does not permit civil forfeiture, but law enforcement officials there can still profit from forfeitures by cooperating with federal agents, Mr. McGrath said. The New Mexico law seeks to end such profit-sharing in cases where the assets are valued at less than $50,000. Civil forfeiture, in which law enforcement officials can take possession of property they believe is tied to criminal activity without filing charges or winning a conviction, has come under fire as abuses have been widely chronicled in the news media and the federal government has taken steps to curb the process.

What’s on TV Tuesday,2015-04-14,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"7:10 P.M. (Starz) THE IDES OF MARCH (2011) George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon received an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay for this political drama, which Mr. Clooney also directed and stars in as Mike Morris, a Pennsylvania governor turned dream candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, a strategist who becomes involved with an intern (Evan Rachel Wood) with a powerful father and a secret that could derail Stephen’s career and the Morris campaign. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are advisers battling for Stephen’s loyalty. And Marisa Tomei is a reporter trying to get at the truth. “Mr. Clooney handles the plot complications with elegant dexterity,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of Mr. Willimon’s play “Farragut North,” loosely based on Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential primary campaign. “As an actor he works best in long, understated scenes that allow him to play with nuances of charm and menace, so it is not surprising that, as a director, he gives the rest of the cast room to work,” Mr. Scott added. “But the parts of ‘The Ides of March’ — quiet scenes between Mr. Gosling and Ms. Wood; swirling, Sorkin-esque exchanges of banter; any time Ms. Tomei or Max Minghella (as a campaign worker grooming himself to be the next Stephen Meyers) are in the room — are greater than the whole.”"

What’s on TV Wednesday,2015-04-15,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"3:30 P.M. (HBO2) THE CONSTANT GARDENER (2005) In this political thriller directed by Fernando Meirelles and adapted from the John le Carré novel, Ralph Fiennes portrays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat (and diligent caretaker of his plants), and Rachel Weisz is Tessa, his wife, whom he meets during a lecture on foreign policy when she angrily challenges Britain’s participation in the Iraq war. Throughout most of the movie Tessa is shown in flashbacks; she has been murdered in the Kenyan wilderness, where she traveled with a Belgian doctor of African ancestry (Hubert Koundé) to help fight poverty and disease. Danny Huston plays Justin’s colleague, and Bill Nighy is a villain in this tale about the evils lurking in multinational corporations and the Western governments that enable them. “It may be best to take the cloak-and-dagger elements of ‘The Constant Gardener,’ and the vision of justice with which it concludes, as metaphors, symbolic crystallizations of a reality too complex and diffuse to be dramatized by more empirical means,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Justin Quayle, then, is an allegorical figure, an emblem of timid virtue roused to heroic action by the discovery of his own complicity with evil.”"

The Man Who Makes the World’s Funniest People Even Funnier,2015-04-15,article,News,,"['Movies', 'Comedy and Humor']","As comedies become increasingly improvisational, they need an editor like Brent White to sew them together.","Melissa McCarthy, her hands tied behind her back, writhed on the dingy basement floor of an abandoned power plant in Budapest — grunting, shrieking and, despite her best efforts, laughing. “Let me try that again,” she said, attempting a straight face. McCarthy was shooting Scene 114 in “Spy,” an action comedy that was, in April 2014, partway through its first week of production.

Feig gave McCarthy a breakthrough ensemble role in “Bridesmaids” (2011) and later cast her opposite Sandra Bullock in “The Heat” (2013). In “Spy,” McCarthy is the star, playing an unlikely secret agent called Susan Cooper. In Scene 114, Susan has been apprehended and dumped in the basement alongside another captive, named Aldo — a disconcertingly libidinal ally who keeps hitting on Susan despite their dire circumstances. The scene builds toward some exquisitely clumsy physical comedy, as Susan commands Aldo to help untie her, even though he is also in knots, inaugurating a grabby ballet and creating numerous opportunities for Aldo to say sleazy things."

The photographs show them going about their lives, sometimes without clothing, on our farm tucked into the Virginia hills. For miles in all directions, there was not a breathing soul. When we were on the farm, we were isolated, not just by geography but by the primitive living conditions: no electricity, no running water and, of course, no computer, no phone. Out of a conviction that my lens should remain open to the full scope of their childhood, and with the willing, creative participation of everyone involved, I photographed their triumphs, confusion, harmony and isolation, as well as the hardships that tend to befall children — bruises, vomit, bloody noses, wet beds — all of it."

A small library of searching and sensational stories attests to the strong, often uncomfortable affinity between reporters and killers. Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood” is perhaps the supreme example, and one that has inspired several movies over the years. Neither Michael Finkel’s book “True Story” nor Rupert Goold’s film adaptation is anywhere near as accomplished as Capote’s book or Bennett Miller’s movie “Capote.” The new film is of interest mainly because it demonstrates just how difficult it can be to map the queasy moral territory where crime and journalism intersect.

Ryan Sullivan Scales Up,2015-04-16,article,News,,['Art'],The young artist’s abstract drip paintings for a new show at Miami’s Institute of Contemporary Art are the largest of his career.,"The young painter Ryan Sullivan makes the type of ethereal drip abstractions one might expect to require a three-page pamphlet for explanation; but in fact, most of his descriptions are simple.

Sullivan speaks of his practice with sharp, fine-tuned language. “I’m trying to deal with these parameters that I’ve set in front of me and the event of making this thing,” says the 32-year-old Rhode Island School of Design graduate. “There’s something closely linked between the image that you see, the process of making it and the material.

They were soon caught, but the story went from curious to crackpot when officials decided that the robbers would portray themselves in a state-produced film titled “Reconstruction,” recreating their gangsta roles with secret meetings, gats and getaway cars.

In the 1980s, the neighborhood soaked up some of the limelight trained on the East Village art scene, and began the slow creep toward gentrification.

What’s On TV Friday,2015-04-17,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8:10 P.M. (Starz Cinema) FOOTNOTE (2012) The tension-filled relationship between rival Talmudic scholars — Eliezer (Shlomo Bar Aba, above), who toils in obscurity under the belief that his career was blocked by a nemesis, and Uriel (Lior Ashkenazi), an academic star with a busy schedule of public lectures — becomes more complicated when Eliezer is mistakenly awarded a coveted prize meant for Uriel, who happens to be his son. But how to correct the error? Under the direction of Joseph Cedar, the American-born Israeli director, “the fraught relations between father and son erupt into an intergenerational tsimmes worthy of Shakespeare, Freud or the more melodramatic portions of the Hebrew Bible,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film. “It plays as farce, but the chords of family tragedy resonate underneath the laughter.” Resolution, he added, “is unlikely, which may or may not be cause for optimism. Academic life and family life are both built on love — the love of learning, the love of other people — but they survive on contention, renewing and extending quarrels from one generation to the next.”"

How to Negotiate a Ransom,2015-04-17,article,News,,['Kidnapping and Hostages'],Get proof of life.

A counteroffer to the first ransom demands should be a result of exhaustive research. “You don’t need to know their names, but you need to know their modus operandi and their track record,” Edwards says. Whether the hostage-takers’ motives are purely mercenary or derive from a more dangerous mix of ideology, politics and greed, this is not the time to be a cheapskate. “Make a decent opening offer that puts value on the life of the hostage,” he says."

This is their moment in the midnight sun: Our cover next week will feature new books by Karl Ove Knausgaard, Per Petterson and Asne Seierstad, while Jo Nesbo turns up at No. 9 on the hardcover fiction list with his latest crime novel, “Blood on Snow.” Nesbo is of course a regular on the best-­seller pages, thanks to his Harry Hole mystery series, but “Blood on Snow” — about a 1970s hit man who falls in love with his target — is a stand-alone. It was inspired, Nesbo has said, by his desire to do for Oslo what Jim Carroll did for New York in “The Basketball Diaries”: “He makes Manhattan feel dangerous but also small,” Nesbo told The Yorkshire Post earlier this month. “Any big city will have its darker side, it’s inevitable, and Oslo is no different. . . . On the other hand my Oslo is a little bit more twisted and darker, a bit like Gotham City is a darker version of New York.” Nesbo is often grouped with the Swedish writers Stieg Larsson and Henning Mankell as exemplars of a recent wave of Nordic noir, but he told the newspaper he’s at a loss to explain the phenomenon: “People ask me, What is it with Scandinavian crime fiction? And I’ve been trying to come up with a smart answer, but I really don’t know.”"

(CUNY) THE CLAY BIRD (2003) City Cinematheque’s tribute to Milestone Films continues with Tareque Masud’s drama, set in Bangladesh in the 1960s, about Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu), a shy young boy from rural East Pakistan who is sent to an Islamic school by his father (Jayanto Chattopadhyay), who doesn’t want his son tainted by the outside world.

What’s on TV Monday,2015-04-20,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"10:15 A.M. (Starz Cinema) MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD (2003) In the first of three Russell Crowe movies, Mr. Crowe stars as Capt. Jack Aubrey, commander of a British frigate whose crew must battle a faster, larger French vessel off the South American coast during the Napoleonic wars. Paul Bettany is the ship’s surgeon — so deft he operates on his own abdomen — and the sensitive foil to Aubrey’s ferocity. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that Peter Weir’s vigorous adaptation of the Patrick O’Brien series, with land-based scenes filmed on the Galápagos Islands, “hums with humor, passion and life.” He added, “It makes you wish Napoleon were still around, so we — that is, I mean, the British Empire — could beat him all over again.” In “Winter’s Tale” (2014), at 12:45 p.m. on HBO Signature, Mr. Crowe plays a gangster in early- 20th-century New York intent on putting asunder the love between a consumptive rich girl (Jessica Brown Findlay) and a thief (Colin Farrell). “A thin line separates the magical from the preposterous, and by insisting so strenuously on its own magic, ‘Winter’s Tale’ pitches helplessly into earnest ridiculousness,” Mr. Scott wrote about this adaptation by Akiva Goldsman of Mark Helprin’s best seller. And in “A Good Year” (2006), at 2:45 on HBO Signature, Mr. Crowe portrays Max Skinner, an aggressive London bond trader who inherits a small vineyard from his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney). Soon enough, Max, soothed by the memories of summers spent amid the grapevines, has morphed into a bon vivant and fallen for a beautiful bistro owner (Marion Cotillard). Then a young Californian (Abbie Cornish) shows up and announces that she is his uncle’s previously unknown daughter — which would make her Henry’s true heir. In his review of this Ridley Scott adaptation of the Peter Mayle novel, Stephen Holden advised viewers “to make a reservation at an upscale French restaurant immediately after seeing the film or risk going home feeling deprived.”"

"‘The Road to Character,’ by David Brooks",2015-04-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],David Brooks contrasts marketplace skills and the drive toward self-promotion with inner character.,"David Brooks’s gift — as he might put it in his swift, engaging way — is for making obscure but potent social studies research accessible and even startling, for seeing consistency as the hobgoblin of little minds and for ranging as widely across the private domain as the public. There aren’t many writers on politics who will study “emotional intelligence” as closely as they do polls, and fewer still extol failure as enthusiastically as they do success. Brooks’s flaws, as he tells us with typical cheerfulness and ease at the beginning of his new book, are that “I was born with a natural disposition toward shallowness” and “I’m paid to be a narcissistic blowhard” (the admission itself, of course, taking some of the edge off that “narcissistic”). He is, in short, a near-ideal public commentator (for this paper and for many other media outlets) because he is happy to sacrifice complexity and nuance in order to spin a hyper-readable, lucid, often richly detailed human story that sounds far less shrill and ad hominem than most of the polarizing rants of the day."

The Danish people had bravely defied their Nazi occupiers throughout the war and saved almost all of the nation’s Jews. In 1944, the Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal published a groundbreaking critique of the racism faced by African-­Americans in the United States. Myrdal’s study, “An American Dilemma,” greatly influenced President Truman’s executive order to integrate the United States military, the Supreme Court’s ruling on behalf of school desegregation, and the creation of the modern civil rights movement. In 1964, Gunnar Jahn, a former leader of the Norwegian resistance to the Nazis, handed Martin Luther King Jr. the Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo. Jahn expressed the hope that “conflicts between races, nations and political systems can be solved, not by fire and sword, but in a spirit of true brotherly love.”"

What’s on TV Tuesday,2015-04-21,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8:30 P.M. (TCM) MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE (1964) Sophia Loren, the subject of this Turner Classic Movies tribute, stars as an ex-prostitute who tricks her longtime lover (Marcello Mastroianni) into marrying her instead of a younger woman by claiming to be dying. But soon enough it becomes evident that she isn’t. Whenever the director Vittorio De Sica joins forces with Ms. Loren, “something wonderful happens,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times about this flamboyant Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film. “The something wonderful that’s happened is the conception and projection of a film so frank and free and understanding of a certain kind of vital woman — and man, too — that it sends you forth from the theater feeling you’ve known her — and him — all your life.” A short film directed by Ms. Loren’s son Edoardo Ponti, “Human Voice” (2014), based on the Jean Cocteau play about a woman’s final telephone conversation with her lover, leads in at 8 p.m."

As Balz puts it, “people don’t like their own party any more or less than they used to, but they dislike the other party much more.” Or to quote Chait: Today’s “voters form strong loyalties based more on loathing for the opposing party than on the old kind of tribal loyalty (‘My daddy was a Democrat, his daddy was a Democrat …’) that used to prevail. The party system has split along racial, cultural, and religious lines, creating a kind of tribal system where each party’s supports regard the other side with incomprehension and loathing.”"

What’s on TV Thursday,2015-04-23,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"1:30 A.M. (Flix) THE MAGDALENE SISTERS (2002) Four Roman Catholic Irish teenagers (Anne-Marie Duff; Dorothy Duffy; Nora-Jane Noone; and Eileen Walsh) are sentenced in the late 1960s to toil in convent laundries run by the Sisters of the Magdalene as punishment for sexual misconduct in this semifictional story. (The existence of these religious labor camps, which 30,000 women are thought to have endured, came to light in the ’70s with the discovery of the unmarked graves of some who lived there; the last laundry was closed in 1996.) Geraldine McEwan plays Sister Bridget, the twisted head nun — with a soft spot for “The Bells of St. Mary’s” and John F. Kennedy — who turns into a demon if her rules are flouted. “ ‘The Magdalene Sisters’ would be too painful to watch if it didn’t have a silver lining,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, which was written and directed by Peter Mullan and won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. “Suffice it to say that it is possible to fly over this religious cuckoo’s nest and remain free. All it takes is courage and the timely kindness of strangers.”"

Behind the Making of Our Walking New York Cover,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Immigration and Emigration', 'Photography']","All it took was an artist with a big vision, plenty of volunteers and a helicopter.","What you see on the cover of this week’s New York Times Magazine is real. The image is by the French artist JR, who is known for pasting giant photographs on urban surfaces all over the world. About six weeks ago, we met with JR to discuss a project for our Walking New York issue. Lately, JR’s work has been preoccupied with the theme of immigration. An installation at Ellis Island features large archival photographs of immigrants displayed throughout the island’s abandoned hospital."
JR Brings New York’s Immigrants Out of the Shadows,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Immigration and Emigration', 'Photography']","As recent immigrants find their way on the streets, their lives are often hidden to the people walking past.","For more than a decade, the French artist JR has been pasting outsize portraits onto urban surfaces in Parisian banlieues, Nairobi slums, São Paulo favelas. His subjects: the locals, the not-famous, the threatened and the threatening, figures in the margins. Their monumental, expressive faces glued to buildings suggest — in ways that a building’s simple face cannot — that a city’s people are its infrastructure too, or are at least inseparable from it."

The Rat Paths of New York,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Rats', 'ANIMALS', 'Urban Areas']",How the city’s animals get where they’re going.,"Most New York animals stay close to home. Yes, itinerant coyotes will traverse the parks by night, and raccoons might travel half a mile in search of better trash, skunks a little less. But feral cats won’t stray three blocks beyond where they were born, and few mice will venture more than a hundred feet from their burrows in a lifetime. Rats seldom stray far from home, either. But they get where they’re going more easily than other New York animals, because they are more like us. The city suits them."
The Secret Slang of the Diamond District,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Language and Languages', 'Diamonds', 'Yiddish Language', 'Shopping and Retail']","A stroll down 47th Street can be bewildering, if you don’t know the language.","The public face of New York’s diamond district is Diamond and Jewelry Way, a block of 47th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues lined with dazzlingly lit shops and exchanges and cluttered by hawkers, hustlers, cops and couriers. But beyond these street-level operations, in back rooms, upper floors and looming towers, toils an army of cutters, blockers, polishers, sorters, appraisers, graders, designers and dealers — most of whom the diamond-buying public never sees."
What’s Wrong With Inequality?,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Discrimination', 'Gender', 'Income Inequality', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Sexual Harassment']","Discrimination based on race, gender or class is the most obvious way we treat others unfairly. But it’s not the only way.","This interview, the third in a series on political topics, discusses philosophical ideas that underlie recent debates about inequality.  My interviewee is Elizabeth Anderson, a professor of philosophy and women’s studies at the University of Michigan. She is the author of “The Imperative of Integration.” — Gary Gutting"
Lee Friedlander Captures the City’s Hustle and Flow,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Photography', 'Walking', 'Cellular Telephones']","The greatest New York street photographs reveal a brighter, more abundant metropolis than the one you thought you knew.","If you’re walking around New York with the intention of taking photographs, you notice how different the city looks every few steps. Your progress is not a line, direct or winding, from one point to another, but a flickering series of scenes. A street is not only its tarred surface, the buildings alongside it, the cars fast or slow, the people around you. It is also the way those things relate to one another, the way they combine and recombine. As some elements slip out of view, new ones become visible: You are moving, the cars are moving, other people are moving, even the sun is moving, slowly, and in the middle of this movable feast you must decide when to press the shutter, decide which of these rapidly refreshing instants is more interesting than the others around it. A second before, it has not yet arrived. A second later, it is already gone. Henri Cartier-Bresson called it “a joint operation of the brain, the eye and the heart.”"
How Do We Protect New York City’s Pedestrians?,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Traffic Accidents and Safety', 'Deaths (Fatalities)', 'Traffic and Parking Signals and Signs', 'Walking']",Making the streets safer begins by acknowledging that people will walk wherever they damn well please.,"When a car hit John Longo as he crossed Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn in December 2013, he was tossed skyward, high and far enough that he had time to contemplate his flight. “I remember thinking, I’ve been in the air too long,” says Longo, whose 230-­pound, 47-­year-­old body landed 20 feet from where it started. He does not remember hitting the asphalt (he landed on his head), but he recalls stumbling to a slender median dividing Atlantic and saying out loud, to no one in particular, “Please let me live, please let me live.” He was bleeding from the back of his head, but he felt little pain, only a numbness in his arm, which was the first clue, paramedics eventually told him, that he probably had spinal damage."
Escape to the L Train,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Teenagers and Adolescence', 'Subways', 'Jews and Judaism']",Fleeing Brooklyn and my Orthodox family.,"I was 14 when I found out about the Canarsie L, the subway line whose lone gray train would take you from Brooklyn to Manhattan. In Manhattan, you didn’t have to be Orthodox if you didn’t want to be, no matter what your mother said; you could date boys without intending to marry them, you could wear lipstick and eyeliner, even both at the same time. But I wasn’t allowed to ride the train. It took a half-hour to walk to the subway stop, and you’d have to walk through Canarsie — ungentrifiable, unimprovable Canarsie — past a lot of questionable landmarks. There was the convenience store where my mother sent me to buy Kents, and whose clerk would ask if I’d like a lighter, then offer me one with a photo of a naked lady on it. And the pharmacy, which was also maybe a methadone clinic, where I picked up my mother’s still-prescription-only nicotine patches for use during the Sabbath, when she wasn’t allowed to smoke. And the public high school, rife, my mother told me, with sex-crazed boys and drugs."
The History of a City Underfoot,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Roads and Traffic', 'Zoning', 'Automobiles']",You never need to ask New Yorkers where they’re going. They’re already there.,"What is a great walking city? For most of human history, every city was a walking city, in the sense that walking was the only way to get around — unless you were a pasha accustomed to being carried about on a palanquin. Now that we have mechanized palanquins — cars — New York’s prideful pedestrianism might be its last old-fashioned virtue."
The Reunion,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Parenting']",A father and son try to connect on a walk to Brighton Beach.,"The longest walk I ever took in New York City was on a winter’s afternoon in December, five miles along Ocean Parkway with my father. This was 30 years ago, and we were, I suppose, trying to jump-start something, namely, a relationship. We were also trying to avoid any mention of what had been, until then, my father’s almost complete absence from my life, beginning when I was 9 months old. Now I was 18, and my father, newly arrived in Brooklyn, by way of Iran, was living in an apartment in Kensington with his bride, who was 20 years his junior, which is to say 20 years my mother’s junior."
Street Romance,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Marriages', 'Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Pork']",A weekly trek to contemplate love and sausage.,"In the late 1970s, I was newly married, living in a fifth-floor walk-up on 107th Street and Riverside Drive. In those early days, my wife, Eileen, and I discovered that despite all there was to do in the city on Saturday nights, the thing we liked most was to stay home and cook for each other. We owned two cookbooks; the one we favored was “Northern Italian Cooking,” by Francesco Ghedini (an intensely serious cookbook whose heartsick, newly widowed author committed suicide before completing it). Our favorite Ghedini recipes were heavy on pork sausages. If you were going to buy pork, that meant you went to Esposito’s pork shop on Ninth Avenue and 38th. You went nowhere else. So on Saturday afternoons, I would start at our apartment and walk south, entering Riverside Park on 107th, crossing over on 96th and then continuing in the park all the way down to 72nd. In my memory of those walks, it is always late afternoon in autumn, the sun is just visible through a mesh of thick, darkening clouds: that time of day and weather that evokes young, headstrong New York to me."
Can King,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Recycling of Waste Materials']","In Bushwick, collecting empties and making a decent living, a nickel at a time.","I didn’t just start doing this in one day, you know. It takes time to work it out: finding out which route produces, when to go. That’s what’s going to turn you a profit. I live on Graham, near Montrose, so I usually start my morning there. I love to see the sun early in the morning. I usually get up at 4, 3:30, 2:30, and I exercise, I work out. I sit at the piano, do scales and all that. Take a shower, and, fwoosh, I’m gone."
Special Delivery,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Postal Service and Post Offices', 'Hurricane Sandy (2012)']",Bringing mail and hearing secrets on Staten Island.,"I get to the New Dorp station around 8 every morning, and I sort my mail. Then around 10, I start my route on Mill Road. It takes maybe six and a half hours to cover the whole loop, and then, depending on overtime, I’ll pick up pieces of another route. Sometimes I’ll cover six or seven miles, depending. I know everything about where I’m working. You know where all the cracks are. You don’t have to look down. It’s your route."
The Old Haunts,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'September 11 (2001)', 'World Trade Center (Manhattan, NY)']",Excavating the past in the financial district.,"During the summer of 2001, I regularly drove from where I lived upstate, in Putnam County, to Lower Manhattan. Armed with historical maps, I would walk the streets, occasionally bumping into people. In a sense, I was not really there but rather in the same place 350 years earlier. As part of my research for a book about New York’s origins, I was trying to locate the Dutch city of New Amsterdam on the grid of the financial district."
The Walking Cure,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'Parks and Other Recreation Areas', 'Jews and Judaism']",A salve when my father’s body and mind faltered. ,"My father was a great walker. It was his only sport and his only pastime, if you don’t count reading or going to synagogue. He recalled walks the way some people recount epic ballgames, marathon strolls he accomplished as a young man when he and his friend Fred, a refugee like him, would wander from Washington Heights to Greenwich Village and back again."
Speed Date,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Running', 'Mental Health and Disorders', 'Friendship']",You can say things on a run that you wouldn’t on a walk.,"In my third New York apartment, which represented an achieved dream — an affordable prewar two-bedroom on 100th and West End, with wood floors and views outside every window — an inexplicable terror set in me. I don’t know, even now, what caused those periods of short circuit, when I trembled on my bed, staring for hours at the gargoyles on the neighboring rooftop, but I have an idea of what made them eventually diminish and then subside."
Among the Rockets,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Ramadan', 'Pakistani-Americans']","On Eid, playing in the ruins of the World’s Fair grounds.","My mother and father lead the way, holding my little sisters in their arms. I run ahead, excited. It’s summer, and the streets of Corona swell with Muslims — men and young boys in new salwar kameez, sent special from family in Pakistan; women and girls, too, in reds, aquas and silvers, the kind usually found in the tails of mermaids and peacocks. We are headed early in the morning to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, to celebrate Eid al-Fitr. For the month of Ramadan, we fasted from sunrise to sunset, spending our days in spiritual remembrance. Now we rejoice — eat sweets, give gifts and offer a communal prayer."
A Boy’s Dream,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Parties (Social)']","The Grand Concourse was just a block away, but it was a whole new world.","We lived on Sheridan Avenue, one block east of the Grand Concourse, a middle-class Mecca of apartment houses that had scalloped cornices and lintels with a nautical flavor, as if the buildings themselves sat in a solitary sea of gold. We didn’t have doormen on Sheridan Avenue, hardly even an elevator."
The Power Walker,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Walking', 'Books and Literature']","On Robert Caro’s morning stroll, memories of Robert Moses.","Robert Caro sometimes thinks about Robert Moses on his walk to work. For nearly 40 years, Caro has been working on his magisterial biography of Lyndon Johnson (four volumes and counting). But the stamp of Moses, the subject of Caro’s 1974 biography, “The Power Broker,” still in print, is inescapable in the city where Caro has lived — and walked — for most of his life. Moses displaced at least 250,000 people to build expressways, Caro likes to point out, and another 250,000 for slum clearance and urban renewal. Half a million New Yorkers. If you were talking about a European dictator, you’d call it one of the greatest forced migrations in modern history."
One for the Road,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Music', 'Walking', 'Marijuana']",Catching a buzz on the way to Catholic school in Harlem.,"This was my journey for four years. About 12 of us traveled from Queens to Rice, a Catholic school in Harlem. We’d get off the train at 125th and Lexington. Up here was way different from Queens. In Queens, we had houses. Up here, you ain’t got no houses and no backyards. Queens was a lower-middle-class suburb. So Harlem was a big culture shock."
First Time Out,2015-04-23,article,News,,"['Parenting', 'Walking', 'Children and Childhood']",Letting my son go on a short adventure.,"It never occurred to me that my 8-year-old son could walk to school alone until the morning I spotted his friend Hal blithely strolling down the block in our Cobble Hill neighborhood in Brooklyn. I turned my head to look for the hovering parent. Nobody. That’s odd, I thought, imagining an unusually chaotic morning in which the parents threw up their hands and said, O.K., just this once."

But in recent months the 17th-century Dutch master’s life and work, particularly his final years, have been getting a reappraisal."

They worked there for 20 years in the garment industry — so that I would never have to, they insisted — but every night they made their proud exit to the New Jersey suburbs.

I could see my boyfriend, the man I’d been living with for six months, lying gravely on the couch, his body splayed out, hands folded over his stomach in a funereal pose. Candles flickered everywhere, wicking away at some truth in the air. Ever since, I haven’t trusted candles. They’re always masking something."

The galleries, with high ceilings, tall windows and soft pine-plank floors, are as airy and light-flooded as the 19th-century sailmaker’s lofts known to Herman Melville, who worked as a shipboard customs inspector where the Whitney now stands. Art feels at home in them, and the work in the museum’s top-to-bottom inaugural show is homegrown. Culled from the permanent collection, it imaginatively mixes favorites by Edward Hopper, Georgia O’Keeffe and Jasper Johns with objects and artists that the Whitney had all but forgotten."

But her gnarly patchwork ceramic sculptures are very lively, perhaps to excess. Ms. DiMattio, who is in her mid-30s, turned to clay and glaze about five years ago, just as the ceramics bandwagon was gaining speed.

Inside the List,2015-04-24,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Cokie Roberts’s “Capital Dames,” No. 10 on the hardcover nonfiction list, is about powerful women in Washington during the Civil War era.","The Power Brokers: As a longtime political journalist for ABC News and a contributor to NPR’s “Morning Edition,” Cokie Roberts regularly dissects the power dynamics of modern-day Washington. As an author, though, she’s demonstrated a special regard for the farther reaches of American history and its behind-the-scenes players — especially, in best sellers like “Founding Mothers” and “Ladies of Liberty,” the political wives of the early Republic. Now she looks back to the Civil War era in “Capital Dames,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. “These women were lobbied by favor-seekers or bill-passer-seekers or just individuals,” she said recently on NPR. “They would be the person who had the ear of the powerful man more than anyone else. . . . It’s really remarkable how much we do the same things century in, century out. You recognize their concern about their children; you recognize their interest in fashion; you recognize the jewelry that they’re wearing. Mary Lincoln’s pearls were on display at the Library of Congress the other night; I would have loved to take them out of the case and put them on. But you also recognize their intelligence and their political sensibility.” All of this inevitably calls to mind a terrific play that ran at Lincoln Center last year, “The City of Conversation,” by the underappreciated novelist and playwright Anthony Giardina, tracking several decades in the life of a fictional capital dame. “We’re an arm of the government, you might say,” Giardina’s stalwart heroine declares of Washington’s hostess class. “Or we were.

What’s on TV Saturday,2015-04-25,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Showtime) BOYHOOD (2014) Starting in 2002, Richard Linklater began to film four characters — a boy (Ellar Coltrane), then 6; his sister (Lorelei Linklater, Mr. Linklater’s daughter); and their parents (the Oscar-winning Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, in a nominated role) — over 12 consecutive years, composing the script as the movie progressed. “What emerged from those dozen years is a series of meticulously textured and structured scenes set to the rhythm of life,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Siblings argue. A mother struggles with men, paying the bills and earning several college degrees. An estranged father roars into his children’s lives in a 1968 GTO. “The story in ‘Boyhood’ is blissfully simple: A child grows up,” Ms. Dargis added about this film, which also earned Oscar nominations for best picture, directing, original screenplay and editing. “This, along with the modesty of its physical production — its humble rooms, quiet moments, ordinary lives — can obscure Mr. Linklater’s ambitions and the greatness of his achievement.” But in his masterpiece, she said, “he both captures moments in time and relinquishes them as he moves from year to year. He isn’t fighting time but embracing it in all its glorious and agonizingly fleeting beauty.”"

"‘The Life of Saul Bellow: To Fame and Fortune, 1915-1964,’ by Zachary Leader",2015-04-27,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']","The first volume of Zachary Leader’s biography of Saul Bellow ends in 1964, with the publication of “Herzog.”","The very long first volume of Zachary Leader’s biography of Saul Bellow — a second book will cover the later years — ends in 1964, with the publication of “Herzog,” the novel that secured Bellow’s position, at age 49, as the more or less undisputed champ of midcentury American fiction. The country was becoming steadily citified, and Bellow — born outside Montreal, raised in Chicago, at home in Manhattan — was the laureate of the new urban cosmos. “Mr. Bellow has something like a genius for place,” V. S. Pritchett marveled in The New York Review of Books. “There is not a descriptive insinuator of what a city like New York is like from minute to minute who comes anywhere near him. Some novelists stage it, others document it; he is breathing in it.” The big ideas and Great Books blurtings of Moses Herzog, a cuckolded professor and “poor soldier of culture” who goes on a half-crazed ­letter-writing spree (“Dear Doktor Professor Heideg­ger”), bounce like molecules off the shifting surfaces and bristling planes of Manhattan: the crowded sidewalks and pinched apartments, the humps of brown rock “speckled with mica” in Central Park, glimpsed between the blinds of an Upper West Side doctor’s office whose “dark walls seemed swollen with the disease of old buildings in New York.” Dropping his subway fare in the slot, Herzog sees “a whole series of tokens lighted from within and magnified by the glass” and notes that “innumerable millions of passengers had polished the wood of the turnstile with their hips.” In Bellow’s urban pastoral, mass human activity both exhilarates and terrifies, duplicating nature’s impersonal patterned randomness — as “megatons of water shape organisms on the ocean floor. As tides polish stones. As winds hollow cliffs.”"
"‘There Is Simply Too Much to Think About,’ Saul Bellow’s Nonfiction",2015-04-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Martin Amis reviews a new collection of Saul Bellow’s nonfiction, including criticism, interviews and speeches.","“The flies wait hungrily in the air,” writes Saul Bellow (in a description of Shawneetown in southern Illinois), “sheets of flies that make a noise like the tearing of tissue paper.” Go and tear some tissue paper in two, ­slowly: It sounds just like the sullen purr of bristling vermin. But how, you wonder, did Bellow know what torn tissue paper sounded like in the first place? And then you wonder what this minutely vigilant detail is doing in Holiday magazine (in 1957), rather than in the work in progress, “Henderson the Rain King” (1959). It or something even better probably is in “Henderson.” For Bellow’s fictional and nonfictional voices intertwine and cross-pollinate. This is from a film review of 1962: “There she is, stout and old, a sinking, squarish frame of bones.” Two decades later the image would effloresce in the story/novella “Cousins”:"

"‘Ordinary Light: A Memoir,’ by Tracy K. Smith",2015-04-28,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets']","A memoir of race, faith and a mother’s devotion, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Tracy K. Smith.","In “The Souls of Black Folk” (1903), W. E. B. Du Bois defined the double consciousness of the African-American, the peculiar sensation “of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape” of an alien world. The African-American ever feels his or her two-ness, “two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body.” Segregation placed a veil between the black observer and that other world, the white one. Du Bois’s description of the black individual who is yet American remained apt into the era of increased integration, as shown in various autobiographies that began to appear in the 1990s by young black people who had entered the middle class. The experience of an elite school or a profession was understood as a leaving of the black world. Now we are hearing from the children of those black parents who rent the veil. For them, the Huxtable generation, whiteness may no longer be synonymous with what it is to be American or “normal,” but to be black still means knowing how to survive on what Du Bois elsewhere identified as the “island within.”"

What’s on TV Wednesday,2015-04-29,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"3:50 P.M.

Available today, the monograph features photographs of more than 150 sculptures, all shot by Schlesinger’s partner of 40 years, Eric Boman.

A longtime friend of Hood by Air’s Shayne Oliver, she has worked with the brand, making music for commercials, runway shows and after-parties, since 2010. She wore Hood by Air in A$AP Rocky’s first major music video, “Peso,” in 2011, and played an integral role in launching its women’s line in fall 2014, creating a live sound installation alongside Fatima Al Qadiri.

Rankling several standards of taste, she reclaims women’s pleasure as their own while sometimes evoking metaphorically the repressions such freedom can invite. “Triptych,” the largest painting in Ms. Yuskavage’s previous solo show at Zwirner (in 2011), suggested the blood sacrifice of one of her sprites by stern pioneer women from the Old West."

Alice is the program’s guiding creative spirit and also its star, so the content reflects her interests: low-“carbohydrant” cooking, swan figurines, the neutering of dogs, re-enacted episodes of childhood humiliation and, above all, herself. She is both unstable and self-absorbed, and though she has spent years studying the broadcast work of Oprah Winfrey on VHS, Alice’s on-air gestures and intonations can be as awkward as her self-help pronouncements are bizarre.

So far, I’ve received comments such as, “Wow, I wish I could have a two-month vacation!” and “I hope you enjoy your break.” I have tried referring to this period as “medical disability leave,” but that hasn’t changed the general perception that I will be loafing around.

"‘Days of Grace,’ a Mexican Film by Everardo Gout",2015-04-30,article,Review,,['Movies'],"The film uses three plotlines that take place during successive World Cups, in 2002, 2006 and 2010.","“Days of Grace,” the debut feature from Everardo Gout, a Mexican filmmaker with a background in music videos and television commercials, weaves together three stories of violence and corruption in Mexico City. Braided narratives are a way for directors both to show off their chops and to illuminate social issues and complex themes. Mr. Gout combines a slick, kinetic style with a somber ethical sense. His movie is flashy and entertaining, but also earnestly concerned with the collapse of trust and integrity at every level of society."

"Review: In ‘Far From Men,’ a Teacher Caught in the Crossfire",2015-04-30,article,Review,,['Movies'],Two starkly different men are thrown together in this film inspired by a short story by Albert Camus.,"In “Far From Men,” Viggo Mortensen, his sharply planed face weathered and solemn, plays a man who looks as if he were quarried right out of the hard red-rock earth. He plays Daru, a teacher who imparts the names of French rivers to eager Algerian children in a small white schoolhouse that’s nestled in a valley and ringed by jagged desert mountains. There’s something haunted about this wildly beautiful place with its thirsty ground and sparse vegetation, though only partly because the story takes place in 1954, the year the fight for Algerian independence ignited.

"Review: In ‘Hyena,’ a Rogue Cop Finds Himself in Too Deep",2015-04-30,article,Review,,['Movies'],"As kingpins do battle in London in Gerald Johnson’s drama, there’s plenty of human trafficking, drug smuggling and viscera.","“Hyena,” Gerard Johnson’s corrupt-cop drama, is the kind of gory British policier from which you come away with the queasy feeling that the world is essentially a butcher shop ruled by greed, murder, cruelty and lust. American equivalents like “Bad Lieutenant” at least have a moral compass, however twisted. British crime films in a similar mode (I’m thinking particularly of “Filth”) begin from the Hobbesian presumption that, as Mick Jagger sings in “Sympathy for the Devil,” “every cop is a criminal.”"
