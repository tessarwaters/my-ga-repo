Characters toss off lines like “I’ve never read the Borges book this quote is from” and “It’s actually the most comprehensive book about the freeway revolt in Philadelphia that I’ve read.” Such insights and humblebrags are the bulk of the dialogue.

They were both students: Clémentine from Brittany, and Abdel-Razak, on scholarship, from a village in Syria. Riad was born in 1978. With a young child and a newly minted doctorate in history, Abdel-Razak — whose stated aspiration for his son, to become “the Arab of the future,” lends Sattouf’s autobiographical series its name — moved his family to Libya for a teaching position before eventually landing in Syria, in the Sunni village of Ter Maaleh, where he had grown up. Sattouf’s graphic narratives of his country-and-culture-hopping childhood — of which, with THE ARAB OF THE FUTURE 3: A Childhood in the Middle East, 1985-1987 (Metropolitan/Holt, $27), we now have three volumes in an ongoing story — are translated from the French by Sam Taylor. They reveal the easy charm also displayed in Marjane Satrapi’s “Persepolis” volumes, setting up a central, and often amusing, tension between a pictured child protagonist and that same person’s adult, retrospective narration.

After years of failing to track down similar pieces, she decided to make her own, working closely with artisans from Tongyeong, South Korea. In 2017, she produced a collection of richly colored cashmere nubi for Hermès. On November 15, Seoul’s Gallery Hyundai will unveil her newest works: silk canvases hand sewn with color-blocked geometric forms inspired by such droll Korean proverbs as “eat the rice cake lying down” and “even a straw sandal has its pair.” The show will also feature a selection of woven sculptures she created with a cooperative of female basket makers in the remote Oaxacan village of Santa María Ixcatlán. Though the town’s indigenous language is all but lost, Lee says, its residents still know how to weave palm leaves. “We were inventing new shapes and naming them,” she said, “to allow an ancient language to resurface.” — MERRELL HAMBLETON"

After graduation, he joined a modern dance troupe and drew illustrations for European fashion magazines such as Vanity Fair Italia and Vogue Hommes. In 1987, he took a position styling shoes at Christian Dior, and so began his distinguished career in fashion. Hermès was next to notice Hardy’s talents, naming him creative director of its men’s and women’s shoes in 1990 — and, later, of its haute joaillerie. In 1999, he started his own label, known for its color-blocked saddlebags and men’s sneakers.

It is told by an unnamed narrator who recounts struggling with the decision of whether to have children with her partner, Johannes. (In real life, Ms. Greengrass has two young children.) Told in patient, psychologically complex prose, “Sight” combines the narrator’s thoughts about her own mother, who died several years earlier, and her remembrances of her grandmother, a psychoanalyst, with her relevant digressions about scientific history. (Real-life figures contemplated in the book include Sigmund Freud; Wilhelm Röntgen, who discovered X-rays; and John Hunter, an 18th-century surgeon and anatomist.) The narrator’s thoughts about having children undergirds the story, but the novel is also concerned with the nature of grief, selfhood and memory. Below, Ms. Greengrass talks about the early history of psychoanalysis, writing a novel while starting her own family and more."

"Does This Moment in History Call for More ‘Nuance,’ or Less?",2018-10-16,article,News,,"['Social Media', '#MeToo Movement']",Focusing on subtleties makes sense when you’re engaged in a conversation. It may be less useful when that conversation turns into a battle.,"When the world seems stable and tranquil, neutrality can start to feel less like a luxury and more like a virtue. This is especially true for those who see themselves as presiding over the calm — those who will be most surprised when open conflict erupts and they look down from their civil conversations to find weapons in their hands. So if you worry that we may be living through a historic rupture, it might be instructive to look to those most attuned to the status quo, and perhaps most sensitive when it changes: the moderates, those who imagine themselves floating above partisan passions, those who judged the existing order to be working fine. They tend, by nature, to be needle-threaders, nonparticipants, mediators. Their current mood is wistful, but also annoyed and sometimes threatened. Something has been lost in our politics, they say: our civility; our ability to communicate, reason, deliberate. What they mourn above all, though, is the loss of nuance."

8 Artists on the Influence of Carrie Mae Weems,2018-10-17,article,News,,"['Art', 'Photography']","LaToya Ruby Frazier, Laurie Simmons and more reflect on how the photographer helped them see things differently.","The art of Carrie Mae Weems is as subtle and sublimely elegant as it is uncompromisingly political. One of the six cover subjects of T’s 2018 Greats issue, she is among the most radically innovative artists working today. In a career spanning nearly five decades — working across photography, video, installations and public art campaigns — Weems has laid bare the historical biases that guide our own actions and shape our perceptions of others. Take, for example, her series “Museums” (2006–present), in which the artist stares down the pyramidal glass portal to the Louvre, the sinuous curves of the Guggenheim Bilbao, and the august colonnade of the British Museum, as though to challenge the institutions that have long determined what counts as culture and beauty. In this project, and in the dozens more that comprise her practice, Weems addresses questions of power, violence, exclusion, access and authority — especially as they pertain to race and gender — and dares her viewers to do the same. The pathos in all of her works, from intimate photographs of her family to series involving archival images of enslaved Africans, unites her subjects and viewers in a common humanity."

Musks for Men Who Appreciate Subtlety ,2018-10-18,article,News,,"['Perfumes and Fragrances', 'Smells and Odors', 'Men and Boys']","Lush without being overpowering, these new fragrances celebrate the scent’s multitudes.","Musk: One can almost smell the word. In the past, musk has been associated with fragrances that are both dank and overpowering, but that’s becoming less and less true. Because the harvesting of the substance — which comes from the gland of the endangered male musk deer — has been illegal since 1975, all commercial musk is a synthetic interpretation of the actual, animal thing. First synthesized by the chemist Albert Bauer in 1888, artificial musk now encompasses a wide variety of olfactory compounds. Gone are the louche scents of yesteryear. Modern musks can be filthy, dainty, weighty, wispy; in short, they’re unpredictable. But the distinctive quality all musks share is a certain lushness, a tendency to smell as opulent as cashmere feels. Frédéric Malle, the founder of his eponymous French fragrance house, says, “Musk conveys different ideas based on what it is paired with.” Yet a commonality exists: “Very often it makes a perfume more addictive.”"

It’s startling to realize as an adult how many of their teachings transcend religion and geography, how the most enduring fairy tales (or their cousins, folklore and fable) are distillations of universal truths and universal fears presented in often-fantastic costumes and contexts: If a stranger offers you a deal too good to be true, avoid it (he’s probably the devil in disguise); if an animal asks you for help, give it (he’s probably a god in disguise); if you are a child, it is better to be pure of heart than clever or brave (though being clever and brave helps, too).
