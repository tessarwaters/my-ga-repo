Inside the List,2016-07-01,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Nancy Isenberg, whose “White Trash” is No. 8 on the hardcover nonfiction list, says “Electoral politics has always encouraged con artists.”","Class Mates: When Nancy Isenberg began her latest work of American history, “White Trash” — a comprehensive survey of the white underclass going back to colonial times — she had no idea that thanks largely to the very group she was writing about, Donald Trump would become the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Now that he has, and her suddenly topical book has entered the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8, I asked Isenberg (a history professor at Louisiana State University) what she made of the presidential race so far. “Electoral politics has always encouraged con artists,” she said via email. “By talking tough, by boasting that he’d love to throw a punch at a protester, Trump pretends he is stepping down from his opulent Manhattan penthouse to commingle with the unwashed masses. Wearing his bright red Bubba cap and crooning at one rally, ‘I love the poorly educated,’ he has built upon a familiar strain of American populism. Which is to say, a dose of redneck bluster goes a long way.” (The same dynamic, she noted, came to the Democrats’ aid in 1992: “It helped that Bill Clinton called himself Bubba and played the saxophone. It helped, too, that journalists dubbed him the Arkansas Elvis.”) I asked why underprivileged whites so often vote differently from poor people of other races — shouldn’t economic considerations be more or less colorblind? — and Isenberg reached back to history for her answer. “Southern white Democrats fueled racial conflict between poor blacks and whites in order to redirect the anger of the lower classes away from the white elite,” she said. “In 1790, John Adams argued that Americans not only scrambled to get ahead; they needed someone to disparage. . . . Lyndon Johnson came to the same conclusion, in explaining the racism of poor whites: ‘If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket.’ ” Then she returned to the current election cycle. “Trump’s supporters want class security, not revolution,” she said. “They want more blue-collar white male jobs, not equality, not social justice. They want to turn the clock backward in order to regain the white male pride that comes from being the family breadwinner. Trump’s slogan, ‘Make America Great Again,’ is a nostalgic appeal to the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s, when America was an industrial power and working-class jobs were plentiful. Until we understand our class system, warts and all, we will be saddled with an anemic democratic system that only makes our class and race resentments worse.”"

The blast was the first of a series of nuclear explosions planned to test the trigger of France’s future hydrogen bombs. The bomb — a plutonium device — was exploded from a tower on the atoll of Mururoa, 800 miles southeast of Tahiti. The U.S. and British criticism of the blast was brushed aside by French officials as ‘‘irritatingly moralizing.’’ France refused to sign the 1963 treaty, claiming it was designed to persuade a U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly. Today most major countries joined in publicly condemning the French blast. But the Soviet Union and Communist China reported it without comment. French officials here and in Paris did not reveal the size of the explosion. A Defense Ministry communiqué from Paris said only that its power was in ‘‘the tactical range.’’ The blast was weak enough to allow French officials to stroll in the explosion area ten hours later wearing street clothes. The United States said it ‘‘regretted’’ that France has resumed nuclear testing in the atmosphere at a time when most world nations have signed the limited test ban treaty. Japan, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Chile and India were among other countries deploring the blast. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 4, 1966"

During the afternoon they continued their advantage and, progressing beyond the enemy’s second line, took the villages of Buscourt and Flaucourt, an advance of five kilomètres in that region.

It made the company a bit nervous. “How can we be the opposite of what people expect here in Times Square?” Mr. Shripka said. Still, the high-profile location should help promote the brand: $6.50 to $9.50 for cereal bowls with toppings, 1600 Broadway (49th Street), no phone, kelloggsnyc.com."

How to Toss a Pizza,2016-07-08,article,News,,['Pizza'],Practice with faux dough. Avoid catching in the center.,"“Take off any jewelry or watches,” says Tony Gemignani, an eight-time winner of the world championship in pizza-­dough acrobatics and owner of 16 pizzerias in California and Las Vegas. To avoid snags, your hands should be unadorned, with fingernails cut short. Roll or stretch a softball-­size ball of dough (11 to 14 ounces) into a 10-­inch circle. Drape it over your hands, and bring them up to your chest like a boxer. Your dominant hand should be palm up, the other in an upward-­facing fist. If you’re right handed, you’ll be rotating the dough in a clockwise spin (counterclockwise for lefties). To wind up for the toss, wheel your palm in the opposite direction of your eventual throw. Unwind, simultaneously pushing up and rotating your palm until the back of your wrist faces you. Release the dough just above your head, and catch it again at your upper chest atop the knuckles of both fists. Repeat. Try not to catch the dough right in the center, which can weaken the middle, resulting in what Gemignani calls “droopy” pizza slices. Always practice over a clean countertop so you can salvage fumbled catches."

"Tiny, Artistic Worlds — Inside Mini-Fridges",2016-07-11,article,News,,['Art'],"Some of the works in Brent Birnbaum’s new show will remain behind closed doors, so to speak, until someone buys them.","“Getting a car opened up my art practice,” admits the artist Brent Birnbaum, who’s based in Brooklyn but traveled as far afield as Staten Island, Connecticut and New Jersey to acquire the materials that form the basis of his new show: 45 pre-owned mini-fridges. Birnbaum spent four and a half years driving around to collect them, hauling them back one or two at a time. He was only interested in the relatively hard to find variety with faux-wood-paneled doors — when stacked in towers up to 10 feet high, the wood grain mimics a tree. Entering “Voyeur Voyager Forager Forester,” Birnbaum’s installation of 16 of these totems at Denny Gallery on the Lower East Side is intended to feel, then, a bit like walking into a dense, humming forest. And like all forests, this one is full of surprises: Using paint and other artistic tools, Birnbaum created a lively interior for each of the fridges, filling them with everyday items from earrings to toilet-paper rolls. All you have to do is open the door. (Birnbaum shared some detail shots of these little worlds with T in the slide show below; you can also experience “opening” the fridges by sliding your cursor over the image above.)"

Inside the List,2016-07-15,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"“Seinfeldia,” No. 13 on the hardcover nonfiction list, goes behind the scenes of the groundbreaking sitcom about nothing.","Must See: It’s been almost 20 years since the “Seinfeld” series finale left Jerry and his friends in orange prison jumpsuits — ­convicted, fittingly enough, of doing nothing — and changes to the industry since then have pretty much ensured that even as television gets smarter and more daring, no subsequent show will have the reach and mass cultural impact of “Seinfeld” at its height. (Consider: More than 76 million viewers tuned in for the “Seinfeld” finale, while the much anticipated “Mad Men” finale drew approximately 4.6 million.) Now the show and its influence are the subject of a new book, “­Seinfeldia,” by the entertainment writer Jennifer Kei­shin Armstrong, which lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 13. “They elevated the art of the sitcom,” Armstrong told NBC News recently. “They did things with it that they were told they couldn’t do.” What’s more, she said, for a show that was supposedly about nothing, “Seinfeld” managed to take on many of the social preoccupations of its time. That makes it tempting to imagine what the series would be like today had it continued. “It sounds weird,” Armstrong said, “but I would have loved to see them addressing things like 9/11 or terrorism. . . . When something is far enough away, you can start to attack it.” She added: “I’d be interested to see how they would address even more benign things like internet trolling, that sort of thing. Could they possibly pull off an episode about transgender issues? I would be interested.” Actually, the trans thing isn’t so hard to picture — remember when Kramer came up with the Bro, his bra for men?"

At first blush, the brass-detailed walnut tables and stools, hand-blown lamps and small household items comprising his debut collection, Series 001, seem unobtrusive; however, as the Cleveland-bred and Southern California Institute of Architecture-educated Pocsik points out, the important things happen underneath. He likens a coffee table, for instance, to an animal (“its legs are sprawled out and it seems as though it could run away at any second”) and notes that the molded leather pouch protruding from its center has an “impregnated feel.” “Bringing uncomfortable forms into the domestic space,” he says, “is all about bringing people out of their current states.”"

But physical violence has become her raison d’être; in fact, the only time she feels safe is “when she was running and when she was chasing. And when she was hurting someone else.”"

Inside the List,2016-07-22,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"Daniel Silva’s “The Black Widow,” No. 1 in hardcover fiction, opens with an ISIS bombing in Paris. “I wrote this book as a warning about what was coming,” Silva says.","Too Real: To a certain kind of thriller writer, current events are catnip.

Could Hillary Clinton Become the Champion of the 99 Percent?,2016-07-23,article,News,,"['Income Inequality', 'Think Tanks', 'Presidential Election of 2016', 'United States Politics and Government', 'Liberalism (US Politics)']",A coalition of progressives has been quietly building a plan to bring Occupy-style ideas into the political establishment. Will the Democratic nominee get on board?,"In June of 2015, Felicia Joy Wong was in her car, awaiting with some apprehension the economic address that would officially open Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The speech was being staged at the F.D.R. memorial on New York City’s Roosevelt Island, and though Wong is a political operative of atypical modesty — she describes herself as a former schoolteacher whose accession to minor power has been entirely accidental — she had taken the choice of venue as auspicious. Wong runs the Roosevelt Institute, a small think tank (for lack of a better term) that originated in trusts established to promote the legacies of Franklin and Eleanor.

Inside the List,2016-07-27,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"Ruth Ware, whose novel “The Woman in Cabin 10” is No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list, says she “definitely” owes a debt to Agatha Christie.","Agatha Redux: The British crime writer Ruth Ware has two best sellers this week — her new novel, “The Woman in Cabin 10,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4, while her debut, “In a Dark, Dark Wood,” remains No. 8 on the trade paperback list after nine weeks. (My favorite thing about that book, which centers on an amnesiac and a bachelorette party gone very wrong, was learning that the British call such gatherings “hen parties.” One London reviewer described the story as “the hen party from hell,” which makes you think things might end in nuggets and dipping sauce.) Both of Ware’s novels resemble classic locked-door mysteries: Her first takes place in a remote English country house and her latest on a cruise ship in the North Sea — a horrifying enough prospect for some of us even before the protagonist witnesses a murder and is accused of losing her mind. Unsurprisingly, Ware said last year that she was a big fan of the golden-age mystery writers. “I love classic crime,” she told NPR’s David Greene during her “Dark Wood” publicity tour. “I read a huge amount of it as a kid, you know, Agatha Christie, Josephine Tey, Dorothy L. Sayers, Sherlock Holmes. And I didn’t consciously channel that when I was writing. But when I finished and reread the book, I did suddenly realize how much this kind of structure owed to, particularly, Agatha Christie. It wasn’t consciously done, but I think the setting, you know, the way it’s a closed cast of characters — I would say I definitely owe a debt to Christie.”"

Does the Disappearance of Sea Ice Matter?,2016-07-29,article,News,,"['Oceans and Seas', 'Ice']","The melting away of Arctic ice because of climate change won’t raise sea levels, but what it means for the world is one of the big, complicated questions in science right now.","Every month, the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., puts out a news release about how much ice is floating on the cold seas at the top of the world. Those who follow this obscure bit of news will know that last month marked the lowest extent of Arctic sea ice on record for June, going back to the beginning of satellite observations in the late 1970s. And summer still has a few months to go. Arctic sea ice typically shrinks until mid-September, when darker nights and colder temperatures come, and the ice cover begins to expand again. We don’t yet know if the approaching yearly minimum this September will be the historical low, but it seems on track to possibly match, or even exceed, the previous record minimum, which occurred in 2012. Nathan Kurtz, a NASA researcher who did an aerial survey of the ice cover in early July, told me recently, “It’s been a very warm year in the Arctic.”"

Other original cast members, like Leslie Odom Jr., who played Aaron Burr, also left the show after that performance and Daveed Diggs took his final bow within days. But the change in the cast was notable for more than matters of casting: It could well have been the high-water mark for demand for “Hamilton” tickets — and for profits reaped by ticket scalpers who make up part of what is known as the secondary market in ticket sales."
