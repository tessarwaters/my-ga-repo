The people at the march are similar to Offred — young, urbane, angry at the shape the world is in now that oppression is hurting them directly. Soon the march turns violent as the protesters are shot at. A down-tempo version of “Heart of Glass” by Blondie slinks through this sequence, which culminates with Offred and Moira taking cover in a vacant cafe. A bomb goes off blowing the windows out and glass cascades down. The song fits neither the mood nor the message of the scene and its placement demonstrates for me how “The Handmaid’s Tale” can swing wildly from blisteringly powerful to absolutely leaden thanks to decisions that feel artless."

The 70 calligraphers include the polymath and type designer Hermann Zapf (1918-2015); he learned calligraphy from manuals by Johnston and Koch. Remember: “Calli” is Greek for beautiful.

The Beautifully Flawed Work of Emerging Ceramists,2017-05-12,article,News,,['Ceramics and Pottery'],"From all over the globe, these four breakout female talents embrace imperfection.","At first sight, Alana Wilson’s vases, jugs and chalices look about 3,000 years old. Inspired by Neolithic Japanese, Cycladic and African traditions, her ceramics have the pockmarked surface of bleached-out brain coral and the faint hue of artifacts that have been buried in the ground for millennia. The Australian artist, who works in a small studio outside Sydney overlooking Tamarama beach, near the famous swells of Bondi, achieves this distinctive look with a mixture of modern and ancient methods. She eschews an electric potter’s wheel for the “coiling” method, an antediluvian technique in which small bands of clay are slowly stacked on top of one another to create a shape. Wilson then coats them, rather unorthodoxly, with an arsenal of naturally toxic chemicals — lithium, barium and silicon carbide — that slowly eat away at the special kind of terracotta clay she employs; and bits of paper embedded in the material burn during the firing process, creating her work’s signature porosity. “I’ve been experimenting with sea salt recently,” says the 28-year-old mischievously. “It melts and practically destroys everything it touches which I quite like.”"

A Different Kind of Sports Novel,2017-05-12,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"Hockey, long frozen out of the fiction best-seller list, gets its due in Fredrik Backman’s “Beartown.”","PUCKISH: Sports novels can sell. Over the past decade or so, the hardcover fiction list has included books about baseball (Chad Harbach’s “The Art of Fielding”) and football (John Grisham’s “Playing for Pizza”) and basketball (E. Lynn Harris’s “Basketball Jones”) — even bicycle racing, which was central to Chris Cleave’s “Gold.” But hockey novels have been in short supply, as Keith Gessen noted in a 2006 essay for the Book Review: “What is needed now,” he argued, “for the sake of both hockey and literature, is more hockey literature.” Enter Fredrik Backman, whose novel “Beartown,” at No. 10 in its second week on the list, concerns a Swedish youth league team and its fraught place in a declining town. As popular Swedish exports go, Backman is up there with Abba and Stieg Larsson; his debut, “A Man Called Ove,” has sold millions of copies, and most of his subsequent books have also been best sellers. But in “Beartown” he’s not skating by (so to speak) on his name alone; he really has a feel for the sport, and for sports in general. “Hockey is just a silly little game,” he writes. “We burn and bleed and cry, fully aware that the most the sport can give us, in the very best scenario, is incomprehensibly meager and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence. …But what the hell else is life made of?”"

First opened in 1854, the bar’s crowd was no less motley when the author Rafe Bartholomew started going there as a child in the 1980s. There, his father would tend bar while the regulars helped babysit Rafe. “I was 5, 6, 7 years old, and every weekend I got to spend a few hours hanging out with grown men,” Bartholomew writes in “Two and Two: McSorley’s, My Dad, and Me,” his new memoir. “Not just any men, but characters — workingmen, old men, homeless men, policemen and firemen.” He would eventually follow the path of his father, Geoffrey, and work behind the bar. “Two and Two” is about Geoffrey’s 45-year career as a bartender; the deep and abiding bond between father and son; and the stories and people that made McSorley’s a city institution. Below, Bartholomew tells us what led him to write such a personal story, what surprises he encountered in the process and more."

I was looking for a clue to a life just passed, an inkling of who she was. Under the eaves behind two sets of deadbolts, and tucked inside steel cases, storage bins and acetate envelopes, I discovered an arsenal of cameras – Hasselblad, Rolleiflex, Leica, Olympus, a bellows camera built into a mahogany frame – lenses, cables, filters, tripods, along with developing sinks and processing trays, a wall-mounted enlarger and giant drum print-dryer, relics of her commercial photo business in Manhattan in the 1980s, her documentary work of the Brazilian interior in the 1950s, and her first attempts at filmmaking in Hungary in the 1930s. And, in acetate envelopes and slide trays, thousands of Tri-X negatives and Ektachrome slides, along with contact sheets and prints, chronicling year by year and in meticulous order, the minutiae of Faludi family life. That is: my life, and my life with my father. "

In the United States, New York is the sole state to have taken the step of offering to cover tuition at all its public colleges and universities. And even this new benefit, the Excelsior Scholarship, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law last month, helps only a small fraction of the state’s residents — households earning less than $125,000 that are not already covered by financial aid — and their grants convert into loans unless graduates both live and work in the state for as many years as they benefited from the program.

Last November, scientists at the University of Cambridge in Britain persuaded several dozen pet owners to bring their Labrador retrievers to its veterinary school for a true test of will. Inside a mostly empty white room, a research associate let each dog sniff a hot dog before demonstratively placing it inside a small plastic hamster cage on the floor and sealing it shut with black duct tape. Some of the Labs showed only passing interest in the trapped sausage and spent more time exploring the rest of the room. But others stayed laser-focused on the treat. One in particular, a black Labrador named Ash, went into a tizzy, banging the cage around and not giving up until he pried the tape loose with his teeth and ate the hot dog."

I’ll be an artist, and I’ll keep a pet otter, I announced confidently, before adding, “as long as the otter is happy.” When I got back my exercise book, my teacher had commented, “But how can you tell if an otter is happy?” I boiled with indignation. Surely, I thought, otters would be happy if they had a soft place to sleep, could play, go exploring, make a friend (that would be me) and swim around in rivers catching fish. The fish were my only concession to the notion that an otter’s needs might not match my own. It never occurred to me that I might not understand the things an otter wanted, or understand much of what an otter might be. I thought animals were just like me."

Not one of them, including great statesmen and professional spokespeople, seems capable of making a well-formed, nonmortifying statement in public. But behind closed doors, where they’re free to express their endless contempt for one another, their speech is athletic and limber and just about symphonically profane. They’re masters of high-speed sophistry and self-serving rationalizations, and they threaten one another as if the power of threats lies mainly in how elegantly expressed they are — as when the former president in “Veep,” Selina Meyer, tells a congressman, “I will destroy you in ways that are so creative, they will honor me for it at the Kennedy Center.”"

It was fascinating to watch a naked crab emerge from the fluted lip of a shell, looking for a new home. I filled a tank with large and midrange conchs. Construction sites opened up all over the tank. Conchs scraped around the sand, levitating on burnt orange claws. The hermits buried and exhumed themselves at unpredictable intervals. They outgrew and shed their bodies and each time this happened, it was magic. It made bodies seem fungible, an armature you could shuck and swap. They moved like a glacial version of the con man’s shell game. They were master vanishers, digging down into the sandy substratum. Mine sometimes disappeared for days. Or they relocated at night, and I would spend a morning beaming affection at an empty shell. This was a little embarrassing. But it was also marvelous, to be so fooled."

Muammar el-Qaddafi was besotted with her? “I support my darling black African woman,” he said of Rice during a 2007 interview with the network Al Jazeera. “I admire and am very proud of the way she leans back and gives orders to the Arab leaders.” He added: “Yes, Leezza, Leezza, Leezza. … I love her very much.” So when Rice included Tripoli on a visit to the Middle East the following year, there were some decidedly uncomfortable undercurrents in her meeting with Qaddafi. “It had been a really strange trip,” she writes, setting aside her usual diplomacy. “I awoke with that sensation one has after a bizarre dream. Did I really just sit in his kitchen and have dinner with his female security guards who many believe are also his daughters? Did he really give me a video — with pictures of me set to music — called ‘Black Flower in the White House’? O.K. Whatever his weird affection for you, thank the Lord, that visit is over.

The new location includes no space for its permanent collection — those 200,000 prints are out in Jersey City — and its first show was a digital hodgepodge that drew as many snipes as cheers."
