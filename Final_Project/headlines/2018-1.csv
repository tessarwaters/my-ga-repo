"Review: ‘Blame’ Conjures ‘Carrie,’ but Without Telekinesis",2018-01-04,article,Review,,['Movies'],"Quinn Shephard stars in her own film, about a troubled high school girl who’s cast as Abigail in “The Crucible” — yet that’s far from her biggest drama.","In a New Jersey high school, Abigail, a quiet, worried-looking student who’s the protagonist of “Blame,” returns to classes after some time away. Fellow students jeer and call her “psycho” and “Sybil.” (The name refers to the 1970s best seller and its television adaptations, about a woman with multiple personalities.) But soon she’s taken under the wing of a new teacher, Jeremy, a former actor, who assigns Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” for a project. And he casts Abigail in the role of — you’ll never guess — Abigail. This arouses the ire of many, particularly Melissa, a punky “popular” girl who’s used to getting her way."

Review: ‘Dark Meridian’ Is a Crime Thriller Starring New Orleans,2018-01-04,article,Review,,['Movies'],A detective and a gangster’s son team up in this low-budget movie from Rankin Hickman.,"At least one clever jolt and seamy New Orleans location work add perks to “Dark Meridian,” an almost proudly derivative low-budget crime thriller that Rankin Hickman, the writer and director, appears to have designed as a tryout for a bigger budget. Chases, shootouts and showy camera moves are executed deftly enough, but given the frugal trappings, they play as overambitious — an attempt to make a storage tank of lemonade from one lemon."

The first time this Belgian-born Romany musician performs onscreen, the camera shows the actor, Reda Kateb, from the back — creating a moment of suspense about whether he will be able to mimic Reinhardt’s kinetic strumming. He does, though music is hardly the film’s focus."
"Review: In ‘Devil’s Gate,’ Satanic Shenanigans",2018-01-04,article,Review,,['Movies'],Milo Ventimiglia plays a suspected kidnapper sitting on an evil secret in this horror film.,"“Devil’s Gate” is unusually energetic even by the current hyper standards of the horror genre. The directorial debut of Clay Staub, who wrote the screenplay with Peter Aperlo, opens with a hot rod speeding down a chalky-looking road in the middle of nowhere, then sputtering to a halt. Out of the car hops an irritated hipster dirtbag, cussing up a storm. The only house nearby looks just like the one in the 1974 version of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and suggests that its owners have received some sort of expansion loan. Wandering around the grounds after his cries for help have been ignored, he falls into a couple of booby traps that render his car troubles superfluous."

What Martin Luther King Jr. Meant to New York,2018-01-11,article,News,,"['Civil Rights Movement (1954-68)', 'News and News Media', 'Photography']","The civil rights leader was stabbed, honored and given a student pastoral assignment. He also led one of his biggest marches, against the war.","The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., though most associated with the South, had deep ties to New York City, dating back to the fall of 1950, when he served as a student pastor every other month at the First Baptist Church in East Elmhurst, Queens. The senior pastor there gave him a B for “pulpit ability,” knocking him for “aloofness.” That would change. The city almost saw the end of his career as well: at a 1958 book signing in Harlem, a woman named Izola Ware Curry stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, convinced that Dr. King and others in the movement were plotting against her (she was committed to a hospital for the criminally insane). Dr. King remembered the incident in his “I Have Been to the Mountaintop” speech a day before his death, noting that if he had sneezed while the blade was in him, he would not have survived to see the gains of the movement he led. “I’m so happy that I didn’t sneeze,” he said."

New Memoirs Try to Get the Balance Right,2018-01-12,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Taking on too much and too little are hazards of the form.,"There’s a certain kind of memoir — call it the hardest kind to write — that sets out not to tell a story but, rather, to tell why a story cannot adequately be told. To even reach this point, the memoirist must decide whether the complications are worth unraveling — or “unpacking,” to use the woeful term du jour — at all. The even more woeful outcome for many such authors is that they become the literary equivalent of someone sitting on the floor of an airport desperately trying to reassemble the contents of a suitcase so that it will fit in an overhead compartment."

The Lingering Dream of an Islamic State,2018-01-12,article,Op-Ed,,['Muslims and Islam'],Baghdadi’s caliphate is crumbling. But it has given new life to a very old idea.,"It was inevitable, a young lawyer in Tunisia told me, that the first attempts at a modern Islamic state would flounder. Young Muslims had grown up under the paradigms of nationalism, European racism and harsh police states, he said. They carried these inherited behaviors into the caliphate formed by the Islamic State, a place that was supposed to be just and colorblind but instead reveled in violence and was studded with mini neocolonial enclaves, where British Pakistanis lorded over local Syrians, and Saudis lorded over everyone. It would take one or two generations to unlearn these tendencies and deconstruct what had gone so wrong, he said. But he remained loyal to the idea — partly because the alternative he currently lives under is worse. “When the police become the state itself,” he said, “it is truly terrifying.”"

In the United States, having equal numbers of women in the work force would raise America’s G.D.P. by five percentage points. In India, by 27 percentage points.

The challenge, called “The Bitchelorette,” was a parody of the farcical dynamics that play out on “The Bachelor” each season.
