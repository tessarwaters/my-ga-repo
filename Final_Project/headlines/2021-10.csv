A Classic Clutch With a New Twist,2021-10-01,article,News,,"['Leather and Leather Goods', 'Fashion and Apparel', 'Accessories (Apparel)', 'Handbags and Purses']","Bottega Veneta has always relied on its braiding pattern, rather than logos, for brand recognition. Its new bag updates the technique with a novel weave.","Bottega Veneta began in 1966 as a leather-goods company based in the Italian town of Vicenza, focused on quiet sophistication and meticulous craftsmanship. Nearly a decade later, the brand debuted a collection of handbags, made by artisans in the Veneto region, using a centuries-old weaving method called intrecciato, meaning “intertwined.” That style — which involves interlocking long, fettuccine-thin strips of leather into a braided pattern that resembles a lattice pie crust — quickly became the leitmotif of the house, known for refraining from logos altogether. In the ’80s, Lauren Hutton carried one of its intrecciato clutches in “American Gigolo” (1980), and Andy Warhol, who often turned to Bottega for his Christmas shopping, was photographed holding up a braided loafer in a department store. (The artist was such a fan of the brand that he produced a short film for the company in 1985.) To teach future artisans the intrecciato method, which takes up to three years of training to master, Bottega partnered with the Scuola d’Arte e Mestieri in Vicenza, an institution devoted to handmaking crafts such as leather goods."

Those early memories of “color blocking,” as he calls it, eventually found vivid expression in Ilori’s work: The artist uses kaleidoscopic hues and energetic shapes in an eclectic range of projects, from architecture and furniture to public sculpture and urban interventions. Whether he’s creating carnivalesque cultural and social spaces (like his summer installation in the courtyard of London’s historic Somerset House) or reimagining forgotten elements of the cityscape (swathing a dreary underpass in rainbow tones), he seeks to spark euphoria and foster connection via an aesthetic that marries the sensory richness of his Nigerian heritage with pristine yet provocative designs."

The couple, based in Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles, have been married for 18 years and have worked under the same roof, more or less, since first striking up a friendship in a San Francisco bookstore in the ’90s. And though the bulk of their oeuvres are distinct — Johanson is considered a linchpin of the Mission School, the post-punk movement that borrowed from both graffiti and folk art, for his colorful semi-figurative paintings, while Jackson is known for exploring the poetic and surrealist potential of handmade household objects, as with a U-shaped porcelain candelabra or a sculpture that incorporates sweaters she hand-knit — the couple have also been quietly collaborating for a decade on collage-like salvaged-wood furniture and functional structures, which populate their own home and studios. This fall, some of these pieces will make their way into his-and-hers solo shows in New York (Johanson’s opens in October at Mitchell-Innes & Nash, Jackson’s in November at Tennis Elbow at The Journal Gallery), each offering an immersive view of the artists’ range and overlap during this recent housebound era."

She was puzzled by Kelly’s abstract minimalist works, several of which comprise flat, solid stretches of a single shade; “I was like, ‘It’s just a green canvas; what’s wrong with my brain?’” says the 35-year-old owner of the textiles and home-accessories brand Dusen Dusen. Such questions stuck with her when she was an undergraduate at Tufts, where she majored in a multidisciplinary mix of art history, neuroscience and visual anthropology. “I studied the visual process from different angles,” she says. “Neuroscience is where I focused on vision: how things come through the eye, how they’re processed through the brain and what evolutionarily draws the eye.” But she kept coming back to color."

His advice was to stop amassing and start selling. Holladay agreed, and before long she’d graduated from knickknacks to more substantial pieces. “I started out with little marketplace finds, but then found one amazing item and made a huge profit off it,” she says; it was a modular channel bouclé sofa she sold to the model Elsa Hosk, who bought it prior to an Architectural Digest shoot featuring her SoHo apartment. That such a transaction was eminently iterative was not lost on her: “I repeated this process of saving up to buy one really great item and reselling it,” she says."

For Arati Rao, the founder of the Brooklyn-based rug and textiles company Tantuvi, the site is a wonder — partly because though it looks like a contemporary art installation, it was actually built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in the early 18th century. “It always just blows my mind,” she says. “The curves, the lines — it feels so modern and fresh.” It’s a place that Rao, 39, goes on almost every trip she makes to India (pre-pandemic, she would typically visit once or twice a year) and that frequently sparks inspiration for her creations, which have abstract and geometric properties of their own."

If his work space leaves an inchoate impression on this August afternoon, it’s likely because the 32-year-old designer hasn’t had time to fully inhabit it, having quit his job at the prestigious design firm Studio Giancarlo Valle only a few weeks earlier in order to become a furniture designer full-time. His decision to venture out on his own was the culmination of a heady year and a half, during which Kim established himself as one of the most sought-after furniture makers in the contemporary design space, using primarily wood and fiberglass to fashion chairs, tables, lamps and cabinets possessed of a poetic, off-kilter presence. “It’s very wild,” he says of his recent dizzying ascent. “It gives me some anxiety, too, because I feel like it could go away so easily.”"

Recall, first, that in many states it was illegal for an enslaved person even to learn how to read and how to write. Then the barbarities of the slave trade, the Middle Passage and cradle-to-grave bondage, were followed by another century of lynching, Jim Crow segregation, disenfranchisement and officially sanctioned forms of violence. Does the English language fail us, Baldwin wonders, in the face of racist terror? No, he decides; we must embrace it, occupy it, refashion it in our images, speak it in our own voices. We must deploy it to redress this terror. “To accept one’s past — one’s history,” as Baldwin insisted, “is not the same as drowning with it; it is learning how to use it.” This, surely, is integral to the freedom to write — the freedom to bear witness to the full range of our common humanity, and all that that entails, no matter how uncomfortable the process can be."

In a two-tiered library adorned with dark wood and the Hungarian flag, Carlson sat across from the prime minister in Budapest with an expression of intense concentration, though he evinced little familiarity with the internal affairs of Hungary.

Consequently, “There weren’t scenes of human suffering.” He did not bring up the fact that civic groups have repeatedly taken the Hungarian government to court for denying food to families held in immigration detention centers."

In some cases, such views are rewarding; in others, unforgettable. In any event, one sees things somewhat differently, especially if the reporting is done with an irreverent eye, a waspish tongue and a “no holds barred” attitude to customary villains, heroes, strategy and tactics.

Essay: ‘The Second Shelf’,2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"From covers to marketing to awards, why do novels by women get different treatment than books by male authors? In 2012, Meg Wolitzer took on the elephant in the library.","If “The Marriage Plot,” by Jeffrey Eugenides, had been written by a woman yet still had the same title and wedding ring on its cover, would it have received a great deal of serious literary attention? Or would this novel (which I loved) have been relegated to “Women’s Fiction,” that close-quartered lower shelf where books emphasizing relationships and the interior lives of women are often relegated? Certainly “The Marriage Plot,” Eugenides’s first novel since his Pulitzer Prize-winning “Middlesex,” was poised to receive tremendous literary interest regardless of subject matter, but the presence of a female protagonist, the gracefulness, the sometimes nostalgic tone and the relationship-heavy nature of the book only highlight the fact that many first-rate books by women and about women’s lives never find a way to escape “Women’s Fiction” and make the leap onto the upper shelf where certain books, most of them written by men, are prominently displayed and admired."

In a brisk, cheerful, easy style, enlivened and emphasized by personal anecdote, this authority on “public speaking and human relationships” tells us to smile and be friendly, not to argue or find fault, to get the other person’s point of view, encourage and praise him, let him talk all he wants to and persuade him that all the good ideas are his. He advises us also never to tell another person that he is wrong, but adds that if we are wrong ourselves we can turn a liability into an asset by admitting it “quickly and emphatically.” If we do all that, we are pretty sure to win friends. And if in addition we have the wit to dramatize our own ideas, our salesmanship will profit the more."
"Review: ‘The Street,’ by Ann Petry",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"This classic story of a single mother’s struggle against poverty, published in 1946, would become the first novel by a Black woman to sell a million copies.","Ann Petry has chosen to tell a story about one aspect of Negro life in America, and she has created as vivid, as spiritually and emotionally effective a novel as that rich and important theme has yet produced. “The Street” is a work of close documentation and intimate perception. It is also a gripping tale peopled with utterly believable United States citizens, and overflowing with the classic pity and terror of good imaginative writing."
Interview: Sandra Cisneros,2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"When her short-story collection “Woman Hollering Creek” was published in 1991, the author opened up about her dream car, writing poetry and her parents.","It took the purchase of a pickup truck to convince Sandra Cisneros’s father that she was really a writer. “He thought I would eventually get married to someone who would take care of me,” said the author in a telephone interview from her home in San Antonio. But Ms. Cisneros took her father along when she went in search of her automotive dream — “a menstruation-red Nissan pickup truck,” she said with laughter. As she bought the vehicle with money from her work, he realized telling stories was serious business."
Interview: Colson Whitehead,2021-10-21,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Content Type: Personal Profile', 'Writing and Writers', 'Black People', 'Blacks']","“I am working in the African American literary tradition,” the novelist told us in 2001. “That’s my aim and what I see as my mission.”","Colson Whitehead warily approached the cold, abandoned tunnel and ventured inside. “Water was dripping everywhere,” he recalls. “It was really dank and muddy.” As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he tried to block out the graffiti covering the tunnel’s slick walls and summon a sense of grandeur. After all, he was standing inside the very mountain that, according to Appalachian legend, had been blasted through with the help of John Henry, the fabled “steel-driving man.” The black laborer’s brawny exploits in building the C&O Railroad had inspired a famous folk ballad — as well as the novel Whitehead was struggling to write. He wanted to feel transported."
"Review: ‘The Makioka Sisters,’ by Junichiro Tanizaki",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"A classic Japanese novel echoes Jane Austen, with instructive contrasts.","Stories of rich or puissant families in decline, stories of the marrying-off of sisters, stories of the loneliness of good manners in a jostling world and the settling and upheaval of social classes — all are traditional in the fiction of the Occident. The materials of “The Makioka Sisters,” widely regarded as the most important Japanese novel since the Second World War, are therefore quite familiar to us in the West. In its massive and tender reconstruction of a moment in social history, its day-to-day explicitness, its full but swiftly evocative dialogue, its psychological directness, it is like the work of a very fertile but conservative novelist of our own culture. Yet it still has a peculiarly Japanese sensibility."
The First New York Times Book Review Best-Seller List,2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"The best-seller lists as we know them today have their roots in the Aug. 9, 1942, issue — but the Book Review has been tracking sales for much longer than that.","From its earliest days, the Book Review has been interested in what books were selling. In October 1896, its very first month, it began featuring best-seller lists plucked from a literary journal called The Bookman. “The Bookman’s reports of the best-selling books,” the Book Review assured its readers, came from “‘trustworthy’ sources in the towns named.” Lists from The Bookman continued to run sporadically until 1910. In 1899, the Book Review began to report on year-end figures from the trade magazine Publishers Weekly."
"Review: ‘Persepolis,’ by Marjane Satrapi",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Comic Books and Strips'],"A memoir and a history of Iran’s turbulent 20th-century politics, one comic strip frame at a time.","Marjane Satrapi’s “Persepolis” is the latest and one of the most delectable examples of a booming postmodern genre: autobiography by comic book. All over the world, ambitious artist-writers have been discovering that the cartoons on which they were raised make the perfect medium for exploring consciousness, the ideal shortcut — via irony and gallows humor — from introspection to the grand historical sweep. It’s no coincidence that one of the most provocative American takes on Sept. 11 has been Art Spiegelman’s."
"Review: ‘Between the World and Me,’ by Ta-Nehisi Coates",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],This 2015 homage to James Baldwin identified racism at the heart of the American dream.,"For the past several years, I’ve greeted Ta-Nehisi Coates’s essays and blog posts for The Atlantic with nothing short of gratitude. As an African American, he makes me proud. There is no other way to put it. I do not always agree with him, but it hardly matters. In a media world populated with pundits, so-called experts and public intellectuals driven by ego and familiar agendas, Coates’s voice stands nearly alone — a black man raised in the streets of Baltimore who narrowly escaped the violence that lurked around every corner and dodged the clutches of the prisons and jails that were built for him, and who now speaks unpopular, unconventional and sometimes even radical truths in his own voice, unfiltered. He is invariably humble, yet subtly defiant. And people listen."
"Review: ‘The Joy Luck Club,’ by Amy Tan",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"In this 1989 novel, a young woman comes to understand her place in a Chinese family — and in the world — through visits with her aging aunts.","Born in Oakland, Calif., in 1952 to a father educated as an engineer in Beijing and a mother raised in a well-to-do Shanghai family, Amy Tan grew up in an American world that was utterly remote from the childhood world of her parents. In “The Joy Luck Club,” her first novel, short-story-like vignettes alternate back and forth between the lives of four Chinese women in pre-1949 China and the lives of their American-born daughters in California. The book is a meditation on the divided nature of this emigrant life."

"Review: ‘The Road,’ by Cormac McCarthy",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"In 2006, our reviewer correctly predicted that this father-son tale would eclipse the popularity of McCarthy’s 1992 hit, “All the Pretty Horses.”","Cormac McCarthy’s subject in his new novel is as big as it gets: the end of the civilized world, the dying of life on the planet and the spectacle of it all. He has written a visually stunning picture of how it looks at the end to two pilgrims on the road to nowhere. Color in the world — except for fire and blood — exists mainly in memory or dream. Fire and firestorms have consumed forests and cities, and from the fall of ashes and soot everything is gray, the river water black. On the Interstate “long lines of charred and rusting cars” are “sitting in a stiff gray sludge of melted rubber. … The incinerate corpses shrunk to the size of a child and propped on the bare springs of the seats. Ten thousand dreams ensepulchred within their crozzled hearts.”"
"Review: ‘The Woman Warrior,’ by Maxine Hong Kingston",2021-10-21,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Content Type: Personal Profile', 'Chinese-Americans', 'Immigration and Emigration', 'Writing and Writers']",This brilliant 1976 memoir evokes the author’s Chinese immigrant family and summons the ghosts who haunt it.,"We know as little about the Chinese, now that we have taken up their revolution, as we ever knew — and probably even less about the Chinese in America. Whatever our pretensions, we are not friends but enthusiasts, and there is something glib and in the end patronizing about enthusiasts. Our curiosity is complacent and safe and rarely penetrating. As China watchers we are a little like grown-ups at a puppet show, and it is no wonder that the Chinese are so suspicious of us, so perverse with our visas, preferring the company of a dozen industrialists on a trade mission to the attendance of one armchair partisan."
"Review: ‘Nausea,’ by Jean-Paul Sartre",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Vladimir Nabokov wondered in 1949 whether the French existentialist’s novel was even worth translating.,"Sartre’s name, I understand, is associated with a fashionable brand of cafe philosophy, and since for every so-called “existentialist” one finds quite a few “suctorialists” (if I may coin a polite term), this made-in-England translation of Sartre’s first novel, “La Nausée” (published in Paris in 1938), should enjoy some success."
Review: ‘O Pioneers!’ by Willa Cather,2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"In 1913, The Times declared Cather’s “novel without a hero” to be “American in the best sense of the word.”","The hero of the American novel very often starts on the farm, but he seldom stays there; instead, he uses it as a springboard from which to plunge into the mysteries of politics or finance. Probably the novel reflects a national tendency. To be sure, after we have carefully separated ourselves from the soil, we are apt to talk a lot about the advantages of a return to it, but in most cases it ends there. The average American does not have any deep instinct for the land, or vital consciousness of the dignity and value of the life that may be lived upon it."
Interview: Gore Vidal,2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Diane Johnson chatted with the confident writer in 1977, asking him to explain what made him a self-proclaimed “authority” on all things literary.","Mr. Vidal, you recently wrote in The New York Review of Books, “When it comes to matters of prose and of fiction at this time and in this place, I am authority.” Is this authority conferred by fiat? By whom? Or is it seized? Or revealed?It is earned, mostly, but it is also a matter of temperament. The critic must know more than either writer or academic. He must also value experience and have a truth-telling nature. I think I have that. In their youth most people worry whether or not other people will like them. Not me. I had the choice of going under or surviving, and I survived by understanding (after the iron — if not the silver — had entered my soul) that it is I who am keeping score. What matters is what I think, not what others think of me; and I am willing to say what I think. That is the critical temperament. Edmund Wilson had it, but almost no one else now does, except for a few elderly Englishmen."
Interview: Ralph Ellison,2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"“It is felt that there is something in the Negro experience that makes it not quite right for the novel,” Ellison told us when “Invisible Man” was published in 1952. “That’s not true.”","The name is Ralph Ellison, heard here and there and one hopes everywhere because of his first, distinguished novel, “Invisible Man.” And to be heard of in the future, if predictions are worth anything at all."

"Review: ‘White Teeth,’ by Zadie Smith",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"A satirical, multigenerational family saga set during the waning of the colonial British Empire, this 2000 debut established its author as a prodigy of the novel form.","Zadie Smith’s debut novel is, like the London it portrays, a restless hybrid of voices, tones and textures. Hopscotching through several continents and 150 years of history, “White Teeth” encompasses a teeming family saga, a sly inquiry into race and identity and a tenderhearted satire on religious antagonism and cultural bemusement. One might be inclined to assume that Smith, who began writing the book when still a Cambridge undergraduate, has bitten off more than she can chew; one might even feel a little huffy that one so young (she is 24) has aimed so high. Is it open season on Henry James’s baggy monster? Yet aside from a rather wobbly final quarter, Smith holds it all together with a raucous energy and confidence that couldn’t be a fluke."
"Review: ‘Sister Carrie,’ by Theodore Dreiser",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"The novel’s headline-making candor and explicitness led the Book Review to assure its readers, “It is a book one can very well get along without reading.”","Theodore Dreiser’s frankly realistic story called “Sister Carrie,” originally published seven years ago, is now republished by Messrs. B.W. Dodge & Co., and deserves to be received as a new book, for it did not get a chance for recognition when it first appeared. Except for his provincial avoidance of simple and perfectly understandable phrases, Mr. Dreiser writes very well. He tells what happens to a farmer’s daughter from Wisconsin who went to Chicago almost as a child, and there to seek her level in the world. She had beauty of a mild sort, a natural sensibility, a rudimentary intellect, a liking for fine clothes and silk and soft places, the good nature which goes with the lack of passion, and no particular burden of education or conscience."
"Review: ‘Wolf Hall,’ by Hilary Mantel",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],This fictional portrait of Henry VIII’s scheming aide Thomas Cromwell — the first volume in a trilogy — won the Man Booker Prize in 2009.,"“Try always,” says the worldly Cardinal Wolsey in “Wolf Hall,” Hilary Mantel’s fictional portrait of Henry VIII’s turbulent court, “to find out what people wear under their clothes.” Katherine of Aragon, the queen who can’t produce an heir, wears a nun’s habit. Anne Boleyn, the tease eager to supplant her, won’t let the king know what she’s wearing until their wedding night; she says “yes, yes, yes” to him, “then she says no.” Thomas More, willing to go to any lengths to prevent the marriage, wears a shirt of bristling horsehair, which mortifies his flesh until the sores weep. As for Thomas Cromwell, the fixer who does the king’s dirty work just as he once did the cardinal’s, what is he hiding under his lawyer’s sober winter robes? Something “impermeable,” Hans Holbein suspects as he paints Cromwell’s forbidding portrait. Armor, maybe, or stone."
"Review: ‘The Age of Innocence,’ by Edith Wharton",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"This tale of Gilded Age New York City became, in 1921, the first novel by a woman to win the Pulitzer Prize.","Mrs. Wharton’s admirable career is a progression from the external to the internal; she began as a decorator and is now an analyst. She has always been an expert in gardens and in furniture. Her first book was called “Decoration of Houses,” written in 1897 in collaboration with O. Codman, and in 1904 she produced a work on Italian villas and their gardens. These studies of interior decorating and landscape gardening are much in evidence in her novel; I do not remember when I have read a work of fiction that gives the reader so vivid an idea of the furnishing and illuminating of rooms in fashionable houses as one will find in “The Age of Innocence.”"
"Review: ‘The Liars’ Club,’ by Mary Karr",2021-10-21,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Content Type: Personal Profile', 'Women and Girls']",The Times would later call this 1995 memoir of a hardscrabble Texas childhood “one of the best books ever written about growing up in America.”,"Imagine you are a child of 7 and this is your sharpest memory: “Our family doctor knelt before me where I sat on a mattress on the bare floor. … He was pulling at the hem of my favorite nightgown. … ‘Show me the marks,’ he said. ‘Come on, now. I won’t hurt you.’”"
"Review: ‘The Golden Notebook,’ by Doris Lessing",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"In 1962, our reviewer described this radically feminist novel — now considered Lessing’s most influential work — as “a coruscating literary event.”","In Doris Lessing’s new novel — her 12th book, fifth to be published here, and a coruscating literary event — she bites off only one thing that she doesn’t properly chew. Though her dissection of British Communism, which is part of each of her characters’ past or present, is clearheaded and most thorough, certain passages of lumpen-politics lie soggy and undigested. That aside, one can only salute and marvel at the staggering fecundity of idea and insight that turns almost every remaining paragraph into a hive of constellated meaning. Mrs. Lessing’s special genius lies in the particular observation, and a firkinful of scorching aphorisms could be culled from nearly every page."
"Review: ‘Color,’ by Countee Cullen",2021-10-21,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets']","In 1925, the Book Review raved about the “sensitive” love poems and “piercing” satire from a young star of the Harlem Renaissance.","In “Color,” Countee Cullen exhibits an unmistakable lyric gift that is out of the ordinary. It would be easy to overpraise him, for it is not often that men of his blood reveal so deep and so modern a sensitivity to the poetic urge, and so his excellence stands out all the more vividly. He still has some distance to go before he reaches any particularly high eminence as a poet, but what he has accomplished in “Color” leads to the suspicion that if he is not spoiled by overadulation during these early years he will produce distinguished and lasting work."

Buckley Jr. is the sixth of 10 children, but not even five older siblings beating him up in his formative years erased his inborn brashness. Though of the political “right,” he has won the admiration of such tough “leftists” as Norman Mailer and Murray Kempton. In 1965 Buckley assured the election of John V. Lindsay by running for mayor of New York and drawing more votes from Democrats than Republicans for his Conservative Party ticket. (He ran in order to defeat Lindsay and instead made him one of the Republican Party’s best shots for the presidency in 1972.)"
"Review: ‘Eat, Pray, Love,’ by Elizabeth Gilbert",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Reeling from a divorce, a writer sought solace in Italy, India and Indonesia. There, she found peace — and plenty of material for a blockbuster memoir.","Early on in “Eat, Pray, Love,” her travelogue of spiritual seeking, the novelist and journalist Elizabeth Gilbert gives a frank rundown of her traveling skills: Tall and blond, she doesn’t blend well physically in most places; she’s lazy about research and prone to digestive woes. “But my one mighty travel talent is that I can make friends with anybody,” she writes. “I can make friends with the dead.”"
"Review: ‘Song of Solomon,’ by Toni Morrison",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"In the deep, sprawling 1977 story of Milkman Dead, the reviewer Reynolds Price found evidence for “the possibility of transcendence within human life.”","Toni Morrison’s first two books — “The Bluest Eye” with the purity of its terrors and “Sula” with its dense poetry and the depth of its probing into a small circle of lives — were strong novels. Yet, firm as they both were in achievement and promise, they didn’t fully forecast her new book, “Song of Solomon.” Here the depths of the younger work are still evident, but now they thrust outward, into wider fields, for longer intervals, encompassing many more lives. The result is a long prose tale that surveys nearly a century of American history as it impinges upon a single family. In short, this is a full novel — rich, slow enough to impress itself upon us like a love affair or a sickness — not the two-hour penny dreadful which is again in vogue nor one of the airless cat’s cradles custom-woven for the delight and job-assistance of graduate students of all ages."
"Review: ‘The Bell Jar,’ by Sylvia Plath",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"To our reviewer, the poet’s novel was “the kind of book Salinger’s Franny might have written about herself 10 years later, if she had spent those 10 years in Hell.”","“The Bell Jar” is a novel about the events of Sylvia Plath’s 20th year: about how she tried to die, and how they stuck her together with glue. It is a fine novel, as bitter and remorseless as her last poems — the kind of book Salinger’s Franny might have written about herself 10 years later, if she had spent those 10 years in Hell. It is very much a story of the ’50s, but written in the early ’60s, and now, after being effectively suppressed in this country for eight years, published in the ’70s."
"Review: ‘Ulysses,’ by James Joyce",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Our reviewer called “Ulysses” the “most important contribution that has been made to fictional literature in the 20th century.” That doesn’t mean he liked it.,"A few intuitive, sensitive visionaries may understand and comprehend “Ulysses,” James Joyce’s new and mammoth volume, without going through a course of training or instruction, but the average intelligent reader will glean little or nothing from it — even from careful perusal, one might properly say study, of it — save bewilderment and a sense of disgust. It should be companioned with a key and a glossary like the Berlitz books. Then the attentive and diligent reader would eventually get some comprehension of Mr. Joyce’s message."
Essay: Should We Have War Crime Trials?,2021-10-21,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'United States Defense and Military Forces', 'War Crimes, Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity', 'Vietnam War']","Fifty years ago, the Times reporter Neil Sheehan took a hard look at America’s conduct in Vietnam.","Is the accusation glib? Or is it too unpleasant to think about? Do you have to be Hitlerian to be a war criminal? Or can you qualify as a well-intentioned president of the United States? Even when I saw those signs during the March on the Pentagon in 1967, “Hey, Hey L.B.J. How many kids did you kill today?” they didn’t make me think that Lyndon Johnson, the president of the United States, might be a war criminal. A misguided man perhaps, an egomaniac at worst, but not a war criminal. That would have been just too much. Kids do get killed in war. Besides, I’d never read the laws governing the conduct of war, although I had watched the war for three years in Vietnam and had written about it for five. Apparently, a lot of the men in Saigon and Washington who were directing the war didn’t read those laws either, or if they did, they interpreted them rather loosely."
When William Faulkner and Langston Hughes Wrote Children’s Books,2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],You might think that celebrated adult authors writing for kids is a new trend. It isn’t.,"For a skeptic who never quite finished the first paragraph of “Tender Buttons” it is a pleasant duty to report that Miss Stein seems to have found her audience, possibly a larger one than usual, certainly a more appreciative one. As to just why, it would take an expert in the subconscious and a corps of child psychologists fully to determine. Not the intoxication of words which keep “tumbling into rhyme,” as one little girl neatly described it; not the irresistible rhythm of such songs as “Bring me bread, bring me butter” and “Round is around,” nor the fun which flashes out when least expected, can fully explain its success. Perhaps it is because, in addition to these virtues, Miss Stein has caught within this architectural structure of words which rhyme and rhyme again the essence of certain moods of childhood: the first exploration of one’s own personality, the feeling of lostness in a world of night skies and mountain peaks."
"Review: ‘The Complete Stories,’ by Flannery O’Connor",2021-10-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],This collection — which appeared seven years after the Southern Gothic writer’s death in 1964 — was reviewed by Alfred Kazin.,"The title sums up author, book and life: “Flannery O’Connor: The Complete Stories.” She died in 1964 at the age of 39; she published 31 stories, of which 12 have been uncollected until now. Now they are all in one book, arranged in chronological order from the stories she wrote for her master’s thesis at the University of Iowa to “Judgment Day,” a harrowing version of her brilliant early story about an elderly Southerner’s exile in New York, “The Geranium.” Since the stories here include the original openings and other chapters of her two novels, “Wise Blood” and “The Violent Bear It Away,” and since stories were more natural to her than novels, we do have almost all of Flannery O’Connor “complete” here. Especially when you reflect that the driving characteristic of her style, her mind, her particular faith, was to find people “complete” in the smallest gesture, or in a moment’s involuntary action that could decide a life forever."

Or did he stick his tongue in his cheek and set out to write a caricature of novels of adventure?

‘No Future’ Review: On a Downward Spiral,2021-10-21,article,Review,,['Movies'],"A recovering addict and a grieving mother follow a self-destructive path in this bleak, understated drama.","Grief, as many filmmakers learn the hard way, is incredibly difficult to portray onscreen. That exhaustive, full-body sorrow, what Saul Bellow called “the rock depth of heavy trouble,” simply doesn’t come across in shots of mournful faces or sad-looking actors staring vacantly into the middle distance. “No Future” encounters this problem early and often. This grim, ponderous drama, about how the family and friends of an addict cope with his death by overdose, adopts a relentlessly solemn tone befitting its subject.

Inspired especially by the hand-printed fabrics she encountered there, the young woman returned home and told her husband that she had never seen anything like them in stores, and wanted to try making some similar styles herself. The pair spent 10 pounds on wood for a screen, dyes and linen and, after poring over a handful of instructional library books, began silk-screening textiles at the kitchen table of their small London flat. The following year, while awaiting the birth of their first child, they printed scarves, largely because they had just returned from a trip to Italy, where young girls were emulating Audrey Hepburn’s character in “Roman Holiday” (1953) and knotting them around their necks. Orders from high street shops soon flooded in. Next, they made tea towels, napkins and place mats with simple geometric patterns.

Some days, and in the dark intervals between days, it seems to me that Glück’s preoccupations are what poetry is for, that poems are confrontations with the void. If we’re on a moving walkway approaching the void, we can ignore it, avoid all thoughts of it, for only so long. And death is serious — “there is no such thing as death in miniature,” she writes."

In 1996, he co-founded the influential arts and culture magazine Index. And between 2002 and 2011, he served as the director of Yale’s M.F.A. painting program. But he is best known for his often gargantuan neon abstract canvases, which he has made in subtly varying forms for four decades (a show of his recent works is currently on view at Dallas Contemporary). Comprising cell-like shapes connected by “conduits,” his paintings are at once luminous and austere, with textured surfaces he laboriously builds up using layers of acrylic frequently mixed with Roll-a-Tex, a surfacing material for houses. A native New Yorker, he works mostly from a 5,000-square-foot studio in West Chelsea, a former industrial building filled with buckets of Day-Glo paint and bins of splattered rollers. But his studio in Connecticut, a modest two-story house wrapped in black-stained shingles that he bought and renovated in 2010, and where he now spends a few days each week, is a very different kind of work space. It serves as both a refuge for making the 17-by-22-inch studies on which his large-scale paintings are based — a meditative process he likens to composing music but with colors instead of chords — and as a memory palace of sorts, filled with furniture and objects from each chapter of his life."

The presence of TV cameras at the time helped keep the events in the national news, and a blistering 1974 documentary by Cinda Firestone looked back on the uprising almost contemporaneously, with sympathy for the reformist perspective and outrage at the bloodshed perpetrated by officials."
