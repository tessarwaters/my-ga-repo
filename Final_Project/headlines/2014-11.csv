John Spinello, above, inventor of what became Operation in 1965, is able to afford a $25,000 dental procedure because of a crowdfunding campaign begun by his fellow game inventors Tim Walsh and Peggy Brown. The campaign, which began Oct. 22 at crowdrise.com, raised over $31,000 by early Sunday. The experience, Mr. Spinello said by phone from Bloomington, Ill., has been “mind boggling.” “It’s really rewarding to have people calling me right now from all over the world,” he said. “You can’t put a price tag on it.” Mr. Spinello, 77, invented the buzzer game while studying industrial design at the University of Illinois. He sold his idea to a toy invention firm for $500, and it was then licensed to Milton Bradley. Through the years there have been various riffs on the character, including Homer Simpson, SpongeBob SquarePants and a version with 21st-century ailments like headphone headache and gamer’s thumb. Though Mr. Spinello still owns the patent for the game, he said he receives no royalties. In recent years, the recession hurt his trucking warehouse company, and he and his wife have filed for bankruptcy. In addition to the donations at Crowdrise, money has also been raised through the sale of signed copies of the game and $3 “Dear John” thank-you letters at iloveoperation.com. Hasbro, which owns Milton Bradley, has pitched in by agreeing to buy the original prototype from Mr. Spinello. Calls requesting comment from Hasbro were not returned. Mr. Spinello said he hoped any leftover money would go to saving his home. But, he added, he would be grateful for “a decent smile and the ability to chew.”"

The plans include three slave quarters, two smokehouses and a detached kitchen. The rest of the money will go toward restoring, researching and refurnishing the home, including purchasing items authentic to the time period or the home; much of what was there has been dispersed over the years through family members or sales.

Burkina Faso: A Regional Warning,2014-11-04,article,Brief,,"[""Coups D'Etat and Attempted Coups D'Etat""]",The African Union on Monday gave Burkina Faso’s military leaders two weeks to return power to a civilian-led government or face severe sanctions.," The African Union on Monday gave Burkina Faso’s military leaders two weeks to return power to a civilian-led government or face severe sanctions. The warning by the Peace and Security Council of the 54-nation organization, posted on its Twitter account after an emergency meeting in Ethiopia, came as the country’s interim president, Lt. Col. Isaac Zida, sought to assure diplomats and residents that the military takeover of the government on Friday was only temporary. The armed forces seized control after the longtime president, Blaise Compaoré, fled amid mass protests over his efforts to engineer a vote that would have allowed him to stay in office indefinitely. The United States government, which is legally obliged to suspend aid to countries where power is usurped by the military, did not immediately take a position on whether the events in Burkina Faso had amounted to a coup. “We’re still gathering facts,” said Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman. “We’re not going to make a policy or legal determination at this point in time.” "

Over the weekend, as the Republican advantage seemed to solidify, a number of writers made the point that the G.O.P. could probably win the Senate without making the kind of inroads that would bode well for their chances of winning the White House (or even keeping the Senate) two years hence. This year’s midterm map is unusually unrepresentative of the country as a whole, the Washington Post’s Patrick Egan noted, and so tonight’s outcomes don’t tell us that much about the future; the G.O.P. is winning more on second-term disillusionment than on any positive vision or agenda, two the party’s pollsters argued in the same newspaper, and isn’t showing any signs of expanding the electoral map into blue territory. The upshot (if you will) of these patterns, my colleague Nate Cohn suggested, is that Republicans are poised to retake the Senate without winning over “many voters who supported President Obama in 2012″ — an outcome that would indicate they’ve “made little progress in attracting voters they would need to take back the White House.”"

B. J. Novak’s ‘Book With No Pictures’ and More,2014-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Five picture books directly address young readers with unconventional storytelling.,"Have your kids gone meta? Do they call their neighborhood jungle gym a “play structure”? Do they mix and match their dress-up garb — a tiara here, firefighter’s boots there — with a sense of mischief that might, unnervingly, be termed “ironic”? Have they spotted the clown at the neighbor’s birthday party removing his wig and slinking out the side door? They’re probably not ready for the labyrinthine tricksterism of David Foster Wallace or Spike Jonze. But on the evidence of a recent spate of highly self-conscious picture books, it would seem that the suspended-disbelief state of early childhood is adapting to the wink-wink, nudge-nudge sensibility of our moment. It’s not surprising. There has long been a strain of subversion in picture books — think of Maurice Sendak and Tomi Ungerer, among others — alongside the dominant anodyne snuggliness of the form. Now, sophisticated cheekiness appears to have gone mainstream. These five specimens of reinvention deftly pop the bubbles of their own illusory worlds, drawing attention to the artifices of their norms and aiming to teach children to become not just book lovers but pint-size “consumers of text.” The best of these books, luckily, manage to find fresh magic in demystification, and to delight kids while spinning the heads of their grown-up companions."

Its cherrywood bar stretched half a block and was lit by a hundred electric lights. With Anderson’s encouragement, high-class brothels were soon flourishing down Basin Street. Josie Arlington, his business partner, had a four-story Victorian mansion with a domed cupola, mirrored parlor and Oriental statues. The exotic, mixed-race Lulu White built a brick palace that specialized in interracial sex and featured the jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton at the piano. Another octoroon (the appellation given to people considered to be one-eighth black), Willie V. Piazza, passed herself off as a countess and sported both a monocle and a diamond choker. Anderson, whose civic spirit earned him the title “the Mayor of Storyville,” published a Blue Book that contained photos and descriptions of the area’s better prostitutes, annotated with symbols (“w” for white, “c” for colored, “J” for Jewish and “oct.” for octoroon). It was all a vivid expression of the city’s tolerance and diversity. "

"‘I’ll Give You the Sun,’ by Jandy Nelson",2014-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A family tragedy has left this novel’s twin narrators unrecognizable to themselves and each other.,"“I’ll Give You the Sun,” the second novel by the talented Jandy Nelson, author of “The Sky Is Everywhere,” is told from the alternating perspectives of teenage fraternal twins, a boy and girl named Noah and Jude, each of them narrating from a different side of the accident that forever changed their lives. On one level, the book is about duality: As Jude and Noah wrangle over who will go to a prestigious art school and vie for attention and approbation and even, for a short time, the affections of the same boy, each narrator struggles to become whole, to become something other than merely half of one. Although Nelson portrays the relationship between the twins, their oneness, as comforting, more often it is claustrophobic — perhaps contributing to the book’s tense, almost breathless feel. One of their favorite games is to divide up the world between them, choosing and bartering the sun or the trees or the oceans. There is the sense that the world is simply not big enough for both of them."

Marie Lu’s ‘Young Elites’,2014-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A girl develops special powers after she survives a plague in this young adult novel.,"It is “13 Juno, 1361,” and Adelina Amou­teru, a teenage girl from a place called Kenettra, is going to be burned at the stake for committing a murder. Several years earlier, we learn, a blood fever spread across this land. Most infected adults died. Children sometimes survived. Some of these children emerged without any sign of the infection; others, like Adelina, were marked and strangely scarred, their hair changing in color. These children, known as malfettos, are considered to have no social value and are persecuted by the government. Adelina’s own father, who regarded her as worthless, was preparing to sell her off to a business associate as a mistress to complete a deal. She decided to escape rather than accept this fate, and in the process accidentally killed her father. It is this act that has brought her to the stake, an uncompromising opening to “The Young Elites,” Marie Lu’s first novel after her hugely popular ­Legend series."

It opens with black-and-white images of the Lincoln Memorial, some suggestive of the view of an awe-struck visitor. The absence of color holds your eye (black-and-white has become a palette for gimmicks and obscure auteurs), as do several arcs traced by the camera, as if that visitor were looking up and even searching. The camera movements seem familiar not only because they mirror the physical effort of what it’s like to tilt your head and stretch your neck, to gape up at a cathedral window or gathering clouds, but also because they evoke Terrence Malick.

From guns concealed by a haystack they inflicted enormous damage on the town, but late in the afternoon the Germans met with summary punishment in a way for which they were completely unprepared. The puffing of a steam-engine warned them as they thought of the approach of a troop train. They waited their opportunity, expecting it to pass a section of the railway which was visible to them nearly two miles away. Their opportunity never came. They simply heard the terrific crash of the heavy guns, and within a few seconds they and their guns ceased to exist. The enemy had been surprised by an armored train — the first which the British had sent to the firing line. The armored train has now supported our artillery for several days. Its casualties up to date consist of one man wounded. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Nov. 8, 1914"

It’s a grim scene. They’re running out of food, they can’t sleep or stretch out, and old tensions between the men have started to renew. The television writer creates an origin story for their predicament: a “coup d’état” in Canada, hostages, armed gunmen. He names the imaginary show “Man v. Nature.” “Everything is man versus this and man versus that,” he says. “It’s so simple. . . . It’s man versus everything. It’s me. It’s you. It’s us. It’s in us.” "

Feeling a little out of place, unnoticed. If we were lucky, perhaps we met someone who, though very different, complemented us. Maybe we met a Jim and, like Huck Finn, left our familiar though confining small town; maybe we were Maude seeking companionship in a boy named Harold; maybe we were Joe Buck, the midnight cowboy in a city that never sleeps, who befriended the lowliest of the low, Ratso Rizzo."

We have to forget it to be able to enjoy reading at all.” Yet sometimes writers — including Stamm — can’t resist spotlighting the authorial hands pulling the strings. The first line of Stamm’s first novel, “Agnes,” for example, reads: “Agnes is dead. Killed by a story.” "
Inside the List,2014-11-07,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Jill Lepore, whose “Secret History of Wonder Woman” is No. 12 on the hardcover nonfiction list, says “Wonder Woman’s origin story borrows from all the conventions of feminist utopian fiction.”","Missing Link: The high-low appeal of cultural studies, in which academics devote serious attention to the meanings and implications of pop phenomena, is nothing new. But it may have reached its happy apotheosis with “The Secret History of Wonder Woman,” new at No. 12 on the hardcover nonfiction list, by the Harvard historian and New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore. “It struck me that Wonder Woman’s origin story borrows from all the conventions of feminist utopian fiction,” Lepore said in a recent interview with Comic Book Resource (“the premier online comics magazine”). “I had never noticed that tie before, and I don’t think comics fans or comics historians necessarily noticed it, either — mainly because there’s not a great deal of overlap between comics historians and readers of feminist utopian fiction.” Among other things, Lepore’s book traces the pervasive bondage scenes in “Wonder Woman” to suffragist politics, and locates the comic at an important point on the timeline of feminism. “People often think of the women’s rights movement as having taken place in waves,” she told Comic Book Resource. “There’s a first wave that ends with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, and a second wave that begins in the ’60s, and in between those two waves, it’s as if there’s nothing going on. But once you lift the veil on the secret history of Wonder Woman, right there in the middle in the 1940s, there’s Wonder Woman, inspired by the feminism of the first half of the century, and an inspiration for the feminism in the second half.”"

During the course of Ronan’s life, I wrote constantly, often through the night, gripped by a need to understand a world in which such suffering was possible; and also to try to mitigate my helplessness and despair by giving myself something to do. “Gabriel: A Poem” — part tribute; part existential howl; part intellectual investigation of our most primal emotions; part novella-like, buoyant, unsentimental romp through the life of Hirsch’s “wild spirit beloved son” — is the kind of wrenching, meticulous study of grief I craved at that time.

But the story she tells — now in greater detail in her inspiring Y.A. memoir, “Taking Flight” — is one of almost unimaginable turmoil and out-of-the-blue good fortune, much like the fairy-tale dances she now performs."

In this new book, “The Glass Cage: Automation and Us,” similarly essential if slightly repetitive, Carr explains how certain aspects of automative technology can separate us from, well, Reality. How, for all its ­miraculous-seeming benefits, automation also can and often does impair our mental and physical skills, cause dreadful mistakes and accidents, particularly in medicine and aviation, and threaten to turn the algorithms we create as servants into our mindless masters — what sci-fi movies have been warning us about for at least two or three decades now. (As Carr puts it near the end of “The Glass Cage,” when “we become dependent on our technological slaves . . . we turn into slaves ourselves.”) "

During the Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps had been his school, where he had learned how to drive a truck, build lean-tos and benches, and helped support his parents. "
"‘The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus,’ and More",2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"The subjects of four picture-book biographies make their marks: a linguist, an engineer, an astrophysicist . . . and a movie dog.","Children, like nations, need heroes to call their own. Parson Mason Weems’s “Life of Washington” rolled off the presses in Philadelphia in 1800, mere months after the death of the father of our country, with Weems’s stated goal to inspire young Americans to emulate the great man’s shining example. We have that book to thank for the compelling image of the rambunctious 6-year-old George chopping down his father’s best cherry tree, then fessing up to his misdeed with the immortal words: “I cannot tell a lie.” The irrepressible parson, we now know, invented the scene out of whole cloth, which is certainly a tad ironic. Yet less cavalier authors than Weems have wrestled with the question of whether, or to what extent in the seemingly special case of a biography for young readers, a touch-up job might be in order. The 1940 Caldecott Medal winner, “Abraham Lincoln,” by Ingri and Edgar Parin d’Aulaire, ends with an illustration of the weary president resting contentedly in a favorite rocker, the Civil War having just come to a successful conclusion. You would never guess Lincoln had those theater tickets."

To the casual observer, they seemed to have little in common. He was a tall, darkly handsome, high-minded Baltic-German aristocrat whose large family had served the czar loyally for generations and were then evicted from their ancestral lands by the Bolsheviks. She was an orphaned heiress from bourgeois Hartford, Conn. — shy, overconscious of her long nose (her “proboscis,” as her older brother called it), as gauche as she was eager to seize the world."
"‘Censors at Work,’ by Robert Darnton",2014-11-07,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Censorship']",Robert Darnton probes the history of censorship and finds it isn’t always what we think it is.,"The impulse to censor is as old as the impulse to create. Plato, not the most liberal of men, suggested that the work of storytellers should be carefully examined “and what they do well we must pass and what not, reject.” His purpose was to moralize literature; others, over the centuries, have offered equally noble motives. Ibn Khaldun, the great Arab historian, reported that in the seventh century, when Muslim soldiers invaded Persia, they discovered an extraordinary number of books; wishing to carry them off as loot, they asked Omar bin al-Khattab, second caliph of the Muslims, for permission. Omar’s answer became legendary and was applied to other book destructions: “Throw them in the river! If they hold a guide to the Truth, God has given us a better guide in the Holy Quran. And if they hold nothing but lies, may God rid us of them.” In our own time, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, forced Google and Twitter to remove content objected to by his government or risk blackouts, arguing that “these regulations do not impose any censorship at all on the Internet. . . . On the contrary, they make it safer and freer.” Morality, truth, civilized society, freedom: All these have been invoked to defend what most people would understand as censorship."
"‘100 Sideways Miles,’ by Andrew Smith",2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A boy injured in a bizarre accident yearns to break free of his overprotective novelist father in this young adult novel.,"In his ninth young adult book, Andrew Smith returns to the big-hearted realism of his prep school/rugby novel, “Winger,” then adds the hectic pace and catchy rhythms of his recent science fiction romp, “Grasshopper Jungle.” The result is a coming-of-age story packed with teenage angst, teenage sex (that is, thinking about sex), about 10 million arcane facts, deep metaphysical musing and great lashings of rank humor. That said, “100 Sideways Miles,” which was a semifinalist for a National Book Award, is more interior and profound than its predecessors, and possibly more beguiling."
"‘Arcady’s Goal,’ by Eugene Yelchin",2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"For Eugene Yelchin’s young hero, athletic prowess becomes a means of surviving Stalinist oppression.","Any historical event, examined from the right perspective, can resemble a children’s story. In “Arcady’s Goal,” an immensely rewarding novel by Eugene Yelchin, the protagonist’s parents are devoured in much the way the parents are devoured in “James and the Giant Peach.” Only instead of a rhino, it’s Stalin. And instead of the boy being made to live in the house of his mean aunts, he’s sent to a home for the offspring of “enemies of the state.” At the risk of seeming to equate the evils of the 20th century with the fiction of Roald Dahl: If you were born, say, in the early 2000s, the fate of a boy like Arcady might seem just as strange and unreal as anything cooked up by a fabulist from the middle of the last century."

Wister, along with issues of Collier’s, Life magazine, Reader’s Digest and the yellow-tinted Mobile Press-Register, made up the household literature. There was a public library a few blocks north of us on Government Street, but I never thought of going there. Libraries were not part of the culture in which I was raised."
Jane Smiley’s ‘Some Luck’,2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Jane Smiley’s novel, the first in a planned trilogy, follows an Iowa family over three transformative decades in America.","Before Marilynne Robinson’s Iowa, there was Jane Smiley’s. While Robinson, already revered as the author of “Housekeeping,” was taking a long pause from publishing to teach at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, Smiley wrote “A Thousand Acres,” a story of an Iowa farm family in extremis that won the Pulitzer Prize. While Robinson was writing “Gilead,” her own Pulitzer winner, and two subsequent novels about Iowa church people and their descendants, Smiley was shaking off the Heartland-Author tag with novels about real estate and tax evasion (“Good Faith”), Hollywood (“Ten Days in the Hills”) and a military wife transplanted from Missouri to San Francisco (“Private Life”). With a short biography of Dickens, she invited us to see her, like him, as a writer whose work is defined by its energy and range rather than its settings and subject matter. With a whistle-stop tour of 100 novels (“Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel”), she lined up with Henry James and John Updike as a writer who offsets her own fiction with spot-on commentary about other people’s work. So it’s appropriate to turn to “Some Luck” — the first novel in a projected trilogy about Iowa farm people and their descendants — by way of Smiley’s critical insights."
"‘As an Oak Tree Grows,’ and More",2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Three picture books appeal to children’s fascination with trees, providing information and flights of imagination.","A few years ago, we had a young neighbor who, walking to school, would stop by her favorite trees and ask what kind of morning they were having, maybe chat for a bit. She was a regular second grader and she talked to trees. I don’t think she’s the only one. Trees have always played a central role in the lives and minds of our species. Researchers tell us that surgical patients heal faster when their windows look out on trees and children do better in school when they can see green spaces. When the famous Treaty Oak in Austin, Tex., was poisoned in 1989, kids made hundreds of cards and placed them under the tree. Not all kids live near historic oaks, but most care about trees, and wonder about them. Books about trees speak to that wondering."
Johanna Skibsrud’s ‘Quartet for the End of Time’,2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"From Washington to Paris, four interwoven characters grapple with guilt and injustice.","Incarcerated in the German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag VIII-A in 1940, the French composer Olivier Messiaen set down what he called “Quatuor Pour la Fin du Temps,” the “Quartet for the End of Time.” It was first performed in January 1941 before a freezing audience of prisoners and German guards. The reception was said to have been respectful if bemused. As the critic Alex Ross later explained: “By 1941, this composer no longer wanted to hear time being beaten out by a drum — one, two, three, four; he had had enough of that in the war. Instead, he devised rhythms that expanded, contracted, stopped in their tracks and rolled back in symmetrical patterns.” The quartet, Ross observed, is “the most ethereally beautiful music of the 20th century.”"

Christopher Paul Curtis’s ‘Madman of Piney Woods’,2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In a small Canadian town in 1901, boys from very different backgrounds meet, bond and solve a mystery together.","Rarely have I read a children’s book so suspenseful that it’s made me worry about being stranded in the weeds with the bleak, hateful aspects of human nature. But Christopher Paul Curtis’s “The Madman of Piney Woods” did just that. Again and again, I doubted that what would happen next would be O.K. for young and old readers alike. Yet at every turn of this middle-grade novel, a “companion book” to the Newbery Honor-winning “Elijah of Buxton,” Curtis deftly makes what might have been simply heart-rending hopeful and redeeming instead."
‘Ambassador’ and ‘Lowriders in Space’,2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Latino characters take readers on a journey into the cosmos in these middle-grade books.,"Like a bad haircut, the word “alien” has affixed itself to the popular perception of what it means to be Latino in the United States. To the unworldly, the average working person of Latin American descent looks like an “illegal alien.” For decades Latino comedians have been making satirical commentary on the absurdity (and cruelty) of using the same word to describe people with Spanish surnames and slimy creatures from other worlds, and now William Alexander has given us a middle-grade novel that stretches out the joke for an entire book. Alexander, who won a National Book Award for his 2012 novel “Goblin Secrets,” merges the fantastic with the ­everyday to create an engaging and smart allegory about the hurt and strangeness of the modern immigrant condition."
"‘How Google Works,’ by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg",2014-11-07,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Computers and the Internet']",Two technology executives explain the business methods behind Google’s groundbreaking success.,"There is a footnote on Page 3 of the new book by Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, and its former vice president of products, Jonathan Rosenberg, that should set readers’ expectations suitably low. The authors are describing Schmidt’s first years as C.E.O., when the board of directors was consumed with worry about its most formidable competitor, Microsoft. Back then Google employees, the authors write, referred to their archrival by a secret code name: “Finland.” It seems like a fresh if somewhat inexplicable detail, until the eye wanders down to the bottom of the page and this disclaimer: “In fact, ‘Finland’ is a code name for the code name we actually used. If we used the actual code name in this book, it wouldn’t be much of a code name, would it?”"
"‘Afterworlds,’ by Scott Westerfeld",2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This young adult novel’s 18-year-old protagonist is the author of her own young adult novel about life after death.,"Scott Westerfeld’s semi-supernatural novel “Afterworlds” beckons us into a universe where dutiful drones, pale from sun deprivation, spend long, lonely days toiling at an irksome task in order to prove their worth. The challenges they face are many, and their chances of survival, let alone success, are low. Though these worker bees occasionally bond with others of their ilk, they’re really on their own, forever outrunning the authority figures who regularly swoop down to assess their accomplishments and mete out punishment accordingly. The stakes are high: If the denizens of this universe fail, they’ll be dropped into the black hole of obscurity where, unless they can claw their way out, they’ll languish forever."
‘The Doubt Factory’ and ‘Love Is the Drug’,2014-11-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Two young adult thrillers exploit the conventions of genre to offer head-on critiques of today’s political landscape.,"To be a teenager is to be acutely aware of power, in all its forms — by virtue of having so frustratingly little of it. Which means adolescent protagonists impose a limiting factor on political fiction. Young adult authors looking to vent their political spleen commonly circumvent this with one of two routes: They embrace George Eliot’s reminder that “there is no private life which has not been determined by a wider public life,” filtering political exigencies through the lens of personal experience and mapping out the Machiavellian power plays of home and high school. Or they turn to science fiction and fantasy and play politics to their heart’s content: There’s no believability ceiling to how teenagers in futuristic societies can change their worlds."

That’s the low estimate for an original illustration from A. A. Milne’s 1928 book “The House at Pooh Corner” to be sold at Sotheby’s London next month. The drawing, signed by the artist E. H. Shepard, depicts Winnie-the-Pooh playing a game of “Poohsticks” on a bridge with Christopher Robin and Piglet. It has been part of a private collection since 1975, according to the Sotheby’s London sale catalog. The illustration is expected to fetch £100,000 to £150,000, or about $159,000 to $238,000, and is one of several drawings by Shepard that the auction house will feature at its “English Literature, History, Children’s Books and Illustration” sale on Dec. 9. Other items include drawings by Beatrix Potter and Edmund Dulac, a copy of “Peter Pan” signed by J. M. Barrie, and presentation copies of uncorrected “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” proofs signed by J. K. Rowling. Pooh has proved to be a lucrative draw at previous auctions. In November 2008, an original Shepard sketch of Pooh and friends sold for about $50,100 at a Bonham’s auction. A month later, the Stanley J. Seeger and Christopher Cone collection of Shepard’s original drawings for the Winnie-the-Pooh books brought in about $1.97 million at a Sotheby’s London auction."

While looking for a subject to research, Zion noticed a grant proposal, never funded, that another graduate student had written on the subject of drug delivery. One possibility mentioned in the proposal was the development of a kind of insulin that would automatically respond to changes in blood-sugar levels, becoming active only when needed to maintain healthy levels around the clock. If it worked, the sugar-sensitive version could transform the lives of the six million people with diabetes in the United States who use insulin. No longer would they have to test their blood-sugar levels multiple times per day and try to calculate how much insulin to take.

That song, a blunt, anguished, barely metaphorical reckoning with the intimate psychic violence of racism and sexism, is performed several times by Noni, the film’s suffering pop star. The first time is as a young girl (played by India Jean-Jacques) at a South London talent show, where we are introduced to the two forces that will rule her destiny: a stunning vocal gift and a ruthless stage mother."

1964: C.I.A. Notes Split in Red Bloc,2014-11-14,article,News,,['Cold War Era'],From the International Herald Tribune archives: the C.I.A. chief discussed the Soviets in 1964.,"WASHINGTON — Central Intelligence Agency Director John A. McCone said last night [Nov. 14] that the “depth of the schism” between the Soviet Union and Communist China is greater than generally believed and that “the problems of repairing it appear insurmountable.” In his first public address since taking office more than three years ago, Mr. McCone admitted that the fall of Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev was “a distinct surprise to us.” But he also said the ouster was an equal surprise to the Soviet party Presidium. “They didn’t know they had the strength to remove him until they sat down to their final meeting on Oct. 14,” Mr. McCone said. The C.I.A. director gave his agency credit for predicting Communist China’s first nuclear explosion “almost to the day.” To defeat the ultrasophisticated security apparatus in every Communist country, he said, required the use of highly refined technical devices. In analyzing recent events in the Soviet Union, Mr. McCone said the Russian people resented their government’s tremendous expenditure on military hardware while they were forced to go without. He said this internal problem was ‘‘created by the Soviets’ spending beyond their resources.” — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Nov. 16, 1964"

I can testify to that after my visit last month to the groovy downtown Manhattan offices of Relevent, a marketing agency that has created a virtual-reality demo for HBO to help promote its hit series “Game of Thrones.” Without much small talk, Ian Cleary, Relevent’s vice president of “innovation and ideation,” escorted me into a steampunk cage the size of a phone booth, made of iron and wood. He fitted me with headphones and the Oculus Rift, as the company’s flagship product is called, a blocky set of black maxigoggles with an internal screen positioned inches from the eyes. I promptly lost awareness of the screen, and after a few seconds, a bass speaker under the floorboards began to boom.

Cézanne kept the relationship and the child a secret from his wealthy parents for fear of their disapproval but eventually married Hortense, in 1886. His letters to friends suggest that he regarded her as a shallow and irritating person. He excluded her from his will, leaving everything to their son. Yet he painted her repeatedly over more than 20 years. Go figure. (212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.) "

Depression Quest, created by the developers Zoe Quinn, Patrick Lindsey and Isaac Schankler, isn’t what most people think of as a video game at all. For starters, it isn’t very fun. Its real value is as an educational tool, or an exercise in empathy. Aside from occasional fuzzy Polaroid pictures that appear at the top of the screen, Depression Quest is a purely text-based game that proceeds from screen to screen through simple hyperlinks, inviting players to step into the shoes of a person suffering from clinical depression. After reading brief vignettes about what the main character is struggling with — at home, at work, in relationships — you try to make choices that steer your character out of this downward spiral. The most important choices are those the game prevents you from making, unclickable choices with red lines through them, saying things like “Shake off your funk.” As your character falls deeper into depression, more options are crossed out. You can’t sleep; you can’t call a therapist; you can’t explain how you feel to the people you love. In the depths of depression, it all feels impossible."

Inside the List,2014-11-21,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Richard Ford, whose latest Frank Bascombe book is on the extended hardcover fiction list, had originally named his character Frank Slocum.","Né Slocum: Richard Ford’s story collection “Let Me Be Frank With You” — No. 17 on the extended hardcover fiction list after debuting last week at No. 14 — is his fourth book to feature Frank Bascombe, following three novels: “The Sportswriter” (1986), “Independence Day” (1995) and “The Lay of the Land” (2006). By now, in other words, Bascombe is as familiar as your next-door neighbor, having staked his place not just in suburban New Jersey but in contemporary literature. So I was startled to learn, while talking to Ford at an event last spring, that the character was originally named not Bascombe but Slocum. “I had a working notion,” Ford explained in a follow-up email, “that Frank was figuratively a man sailing alone around the world — like Joshua Slocum, who wrote ‘Sailing Alone Around the World,’ a book I loved.” But when Ford sent his manuscript for “The Sportswriter” to the poet Donald Hall, a longtime friend and mentor, Hall reminded him that Joseph Heller’s novel “Something Happened” also had a protagonist named Slocum. “So I was stuck,” Ford said, “with a finished novel narrated by a character I didn’t have a name for. This was very vexing, I hardly need say. I’d always felt a character’s name was totemic.” Ford set out to rechristen his protagonist, deconstructing “Slocum” and deciding he required a two-syllable, trochaic name that emphasized its vowels rather than its consonants. “I had a friend who had a middle name that was like Bascombe,” he said, “but I didn’t want to steal my friend’s name. So I rejiggered it into Bascombe — a name I’d never heard before but that sounded persuasive. I was actually surprised at how easily I made the transition from one loyalty to another. It was instructive.”"

In the end, the White House accepted (and publicly, since they released the memo) a limiting principle contrived by its own Office of Legal Counsel, and only extended work permits to parents of citizens and green card holders, rather than widening its initial DACA grant to protect parents of those protected immigrants as well. The White House also declined to make some of the other moves — involving agricultural workers and others — that were bruited in advance; it did expand the existing DACA program itself by changing age limits and moving the eligibility date for arrival from 2007 to 2010, but that’s just a further exercise of a power that the White House had already claimed."

"‘The Chain,’ by Ted Genoways",2014-11-21,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Agriculture and Farming']","In the tradition of “The Jungle,” a journalist investigates the hidden costs — animal, human, environmental — of cheap meat.","Every working day, tractor-trailers from Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota deliver about 30,000 hogs to a pair of slaughterhouses controlled by Hormel Foods. One of the plants is in Austin, Minn., the other in Fremont, Neb.; and both produce meat for the inexpensive, highly processed edible product known as Spam. In “The Chain: Farm, Factory, and the Fate of Our Food,” Ted Genoways describes in appalling detail what goes into that Spam. The ingredients on the label — pork with ham, salt, water, modified potato starch, sugar and sodium nitrite — may sound harmless. But Genoways argues that the industrial system behind those little cans is inextricably linked to a variety of social problems: animal cruelty, water pollution, food-borne illness, worker exploitation, a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment, government corruption and largely unchecked corporate power. Once celebrated with some irony by Monty Python, “lovely Spam, wonderful Spam” looms as a sinister force in “The Chain,” a hidden source of misery in the nation’s heartland."

What happens when a novel whose scenes of coprophagia and pedophilia moved Pulitzer trustees to cancel the prize in 1974 (when Pynchon seemed poised to win) eases into middle-aged, canonical respectability? Well, for one thing, it gets an audiobook release. Since the mid-1980s, a George Guidall recording has been floating around, like some mythical lost rocket part — no one had heard it, but all Pynchon fans knew someone who knew someone who had — but in October a new version, authorized and rerecorded and burned onto 30 compact discs — hit the stands. How on earth, I wondered as I stripped the wrapper, is poor Mr. Guidall going to render the sudden outbreaks of crazed capitals, or librettos in which stoners with guitars pastiche Rossini, the instructions helpfully stating “(bubububoo[oo] oo [sung to opening of Beethoven 5th, with full band])”? He turns out to do it in a slow and deep-voiced manner, beneath whose calm avuncularity you can detect anxiety, even mania, bubbling but never quite erupting — although I could have sworn I heard him, in the silence at the end of CD 30, racing out the door to buy a year’s supply of those Thayer’s Slippery Elm Throat Lozenges the hero Slothrop sucks, or perhaps to check himself into the book’s White Visitation mental hospital."

‘The Port Chicago 50’ and ‘The Family Romanov’,2014-11-21,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Audiobooks']",Two audiobooks for young readers tell stories about the past.,"For the past 20 years there has been a cassette tape in our car with a title along the lines of “Teach Yourself Morse Code.” While not exactly riveting material, this is possibly the first nonfiction audiobook I can remember listening to, and it’s a perfect example of why nonfiction works well in the format. The human voice lends life to words on a page. The tonal subtleties of a skilled narrator can captivate listeners with a commitment that readers of the written word must bring to a text on their own. Steve Sheinkin’s “The Port Chicago 50: Disaster, Mutiny, and the Fight for Civil Rights” and Candace Fleming’s “The Family Romanov: Murder, Rebellion and the Fall of Imperial Russia” are excellent works in their own right, but both books gain a layer of engagement through vibrant spoken narrations."

The documents belonged to Lois Lerner, a former I.R.S. official whom Republicans have accused of politically motivated misconduct.

The inspector general “plans to assess whether this data can be converted into a readable format and then produce these materials to the committee as soon as they have fully recovered and evaluated them,” the committee said in a written statement.

"V.F.W. Goes Gender-Neutral, Recognizing Female Veterans ",2014-11-22,article,Brief,,"['Veterans', 'Women and Girls', 'Gender', 'United States Defense and Military Forces']",The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States has won congressional approval to alter the wording of its charter to recognize female veterans.," When the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States secured its congressional charter in 1936, “veterans” were usually men and the spouses of those who fell in battle were “widows.” That, of course, is now very different. (Indeed, even during World War II several hundred thousand women served in the United States military, including nurses and members of the Women’s Army Corps.) Now, more than 15 percent of active-duty United States service members are female. So the V.F.W. is changing, too, winning congressional approval to alter the wording of its charter. No longer is it “a national association of men” who served in wartime; it is one of “veterans.” And it is no longer to assist “widows” — rather, “surviving spouses.” The changes, approved at the national convention, were made in bills just passed by the House and Senate. “We didn’t change our congressional charter to be politically correct,” the V.F.W. National Commander, John W. Stroud, said in a statement. “We changed it because being an eligible service member or veteran is what’s important to our great organization, not one’s gender.” "

The statement said cases had been reported in seven regions, including the capital, Antananarivo, raising the “risk of a rapid spread of the disease due to the city’s high population density and the weakness of the health care system.” Efforts to combat the outbreak, the statement said, have been hampered because fleas, the primary spreader of the disease, have developed resistance to an insecticide used to kill them."

Ismail Kadare’s ‘Twilight of the Eastern Gods’,2014-11-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The Moscow of Ismail Kadare’s novel is full of young writers who live and drink together.,"The narrator of “Twilight of the Eastern Gods” is unnamed, but we might as well call him Ismail. Like Ismail Kadare, he is a student at the Gorky Institute for World Literature in Moscow in the late 1950s. He tells someone he’s writing a book about “a dead army commanded by a living general” — an allusion to Kadare’s 1963 novel, “The General of the Dead Army,” in which an Italian officer returns to Albania after the Second World War to disinter the bones of his soldiers. He’s also obsessed with the Albanian legend of Konstandin and Doruntine, which goes like this: When his sister Doruntine marries and moves far away, Konstandin promises his mother he will ride to fetch her for weddings and funerals; when he and all his brothers are killed, his ghost does the job, delivers his sister to the church and leaves her at the gate, saying, “You go on, I have something to do here.” This story would be the basis for Kadare’s novel “The Ghost Rider,” and by the end of “Twilight of the Eastern Gods” the narrator has become a sort of Konstandin figure himself. The Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha’s schism from the U.S.S.R. is occurring, and the narrator knows his days in Moscow are numbered. He’s become a ghost in the city, and it’s become ghostly to him. “Once upon a time there used to be a giant state whose name was Soviet Union,” he thinks. "

She thinks it’s swell.” Shields doesn’t mention that article in her book, which is subtitled “The Real Story of My Mother and Me,” but she does talk about the media uproar surrounding Louis Malle’s 1978 film “Pretty Baby,” in which she played an underage prostitute, and all of the racy jobs that followed. “There was a sense of fury and a need to assume that I was a victim,” she writes. “There was a firestorm, and Mom took most of the heat.” Although Shields writes frankly and painfully about her mother’s chronic drinking and poor career decisions, the book — which was prompted, she says, by her reaction to The New York Times’s obituary after Teri Shields died in 2012 — is mostly tender. “It is not a ‘Mommie Dearest’ tale. But I’m not holding her up on a pedestal, either,” she writes. “It is simply my turn to tell the story as I saw and felt it.”"

1889: Metropolitan Opera House Reopens in New York,2014-11-30,article,News,,['Opera'],From the International Herald Tribune archives: The Metropolitan Opera House reopens in New York in 1889.,"Wealth, art and society were well represented at the reopening of the Metropolitan Opera House. It marked the beginning of the sixth season of opera in German. The house had a brilliant appearance when the curtain rose on the first act of Wagner’s “Flying Dutchman.” Although it rained in torrents all the evening, the ladies appeared in their rarest toilettes, and the boxes literally blazed with diamonds. Mrs. Astor was in white pink brocade, and occupied a box with Miss Marion Longdon and Mr. Ward McAlister. Miss Longdon wore pale yellow with a long boa of ostrich feathers. In an adjoining box sat Mrs. William C. Whitney in a décolleté dress of pale green and silver, with diamonds in her hair. Mrs. Paran Stevens wore a brocade toilette, and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt wore white brocade and pearls. On the stage interest centred chiefly in Theodore Reichmann, the popular Viennese barytone, and in Fraulein Sophie Weisner, the soprano, who made their debut in this country as Senta and Vanderdecken. Reichmann scored a great and instant success, thanks as much to his admirable and artistic acting as to his rich and sympathetic voice. Fraulein Weisner’s success was less emphatic, although, like Reichmann, she was warmly applauded. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 1, 1889"

During the recent fighting in this region, and more particularly on Thursday, the Germans have sustained enormous loss. After a multitude of charges by the Russian cavalry, the state of the fields and roads rendered the use of automobiles absolutely impossible. The Russians have consequently garaged a large number of their machines at Lodz, whither they are also sending hundreds of transport and ammunition wagons captured from the enemy. The prolongation of the struggle in the neighborhood of Lodz is probably due to the feverish activity on the German strategic railways on the Silesian frontier. The enemy is bringing up troops with all possible speed, and it is estimated that 50,000 men, or nearly half the garrison of Breslau, were despatched north-west to Czenstochowa to join the newly-formed army in that region. Another great battle is to be expected somewhere between Lodz and Kalisz. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 1, 1914"
