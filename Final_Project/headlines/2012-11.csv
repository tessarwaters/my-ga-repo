If Romney Wins,2012-11-01,article,News,,[],His presidency’s success could hinge on how he negotiates with Senate Democrats.,"For those of us with a Twitter-enabled polling addiction and a bad crosstab habit, it’s almost become possible to lose sight of the fact that there’s more at stake in this election than whether state pollsters are more reliable than national ones, or whether Gallup’s likely-voter screen is an outlier or spot-on, or which party’s demographic projections makes more sense. Maybe that explains why this Politico story on the Romney transition effort seemed to come and go last week with hardly any comment.

Balancing Act,2012-11-01,article,News,,[],Justin Patterson and Anna Burke are perfecting the art of hosting foolproof vegan/carnivore dinner parties.,"Lately it seems that everybody is either a gluten-free vegan or a fanatical connoisseur of meat. What’s a host to do? For a start, take a lesson from Justin Patterson and Anna Burke. By day Burke is a designer at Kemble Interiors and Patterson runs an investment partnership. By night they are perfecting the art of hosting the foolproof vegan/carnivore dinner party for their picky-eater friends and family at their house on the Hudson River in Palisades, N.Y. Patterson is intimately acquainted with both herbivorous eating and excellent meat: he grew up in Virginia in a family of vegetarians — who happen to run a heritage grass-fed-cattle farm. These days, Patterson, who started eating meat at the age of 21, enjoys the yield of the family business (though he avoids gluten). He and Burke, who eats everything and loves to cook, are avid entertainers. They’re passionate about high-quality ingredients (just listen to them wax rhapsodic about Le Saunier de Camargue Fleur de Sel or the merits of cooking with high-smoke-point fats, like ghee or macadamia nut oil) and meticulous about style and presentation. And rather than balk at preparing a menu that has to do double duty, they’ve figured out the formula for making it a breeze. See the interactive slide show >>"

It represents a million earlier drinks downed in a forlorn, existential frenzy, but it also resonates with a foreboding that the director Robert Zemeckis sustains for several unsettling seconds.

This romantic comedy was directed by McG from a script by Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg. “The clever hook in ‘Mr. and Mrs. Smith,’ which Mr. Kinberg also wrote, is that its mister and missus are covert assassins (neither knows what the other does), whose marriage blahs vanish once they turn their gun sights on each other,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while the filmmakers try a variation on that theme here, Lauren is a “weak sister” to Angelina Jolie’s Mrs. Smith. “It doesn’t help that the men’s rivalry soon escalates into spy versus spy shenanigans,” Ms. Dargis added. “And while it’s initially amusing to see them snoop on Lauren, by the time each has planted surveillance bugs in her house, you’re watching a cuddly stalker flick.” "

Francis J. Lippitt may very well have let out a sigh of relief on the September day in 1862 when the steamer Panama finally docked at Bucksport, Calif. It was not the vessel itself he would have been keen to receive, but rather the cargo it was picking up: 800 surrendered American Indians, ready to ship north to Smith’s River Reservation near the Oregon border. Perhaps now the guerrilla war that had stalked the counties of remote Northern California for the previous months would finally abate.

Cutting tax rates at the top appears “to have little or no relation to the size of the economic pie,” the report said. “However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution.” So charging the rich lower tax rates doesn’t promote economic growth; it merely increases economic inequality."

Degrees of Infidelity to Tolstoy’s Heroine,2012-11-02,article,News,,['Movies'],"Movies have long loved the tale of Leo Tolstoy’s impassioned heroine Anna Karenina, but the faithfulness of adaptations have greatly varied.","IT isn’t easy to be faithful. Anna Karenina, for example, the title heroine of the magisterial 1877 novel by Leo Tolstoy, thinks herself happy enough with her distinguished husband, her sweet-tempered young son and her impeccable standing in the highest levels of St. Petersburg society, until she meets a dashing cavalry officer and gives it all up for him. Her infidelity is not casual or discreet, as it is for other respectable women in her set, but helpless, urgent, terrifyingly intense; she doesn’t know what hit her. The infidelity of the many filmmakers who have tried to tell Anna’s story on the screen is not, generally, of that kind. A novel of the length (over 900 pages) and complexity of “Anna Karenina” and a feature film of, say, two hours’ duration do not make an ideal match; dissatisfaction is inevitable, outright betrayal highly likely.

She said she and her two band mates, who remain in prison, had agreed that they should protect their intellectual property rights, but opposed commercial use of their name. The lawyer, Mark Feygin, denied that he or his wife, who owns a film production company, were trying to profit from the band, and he said they filed the application in April at the request of the three band members “to prevent someone from producing condoms and pornography films” featuring the band’s name. But Russia’s patent office rejected the trademark application. Also on Friday, Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev said again that he thought the jailed band members should be released, The Associated Press reported. "

It’s for the good of his children, he rationalizes in this adaptation of the British journalist Benjamin Mee’s nonfiction book of the same title, directed by Cameron Crowe. “The creaks, groans and clichés of the screenplay, which was written by Aline Brosh McKenna (“27 Dresses”) and reworked by Mr. Crowe are, however, finally outstripped by the attractiveness of the performers, those with two legs and more, and especially by the tenderness that Mr. Damon brings to his role,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Crowe doesn’t linger over Benjamin’s despondency.” Rather, she added, “he gives it gentle due in passages that remind you that there’s often a strain of melancholia in this director’s work, a sadness that suggests that Mr. Crowe intimately knows the darkness and uses his movies as a way to resist (or deny) it. Whatever the case, you may not buy his happy endings, but it’s a seductive ideal when all of God’s creatures, great and small, buxom and blond, exist in such harmony.” "

This week, a judge had ordered the Arizona group, known as Americans for Responsible Leadership, to submit to an audit by the California Fair Political Practices Commission, the state’s political watchdog. Americans for Responsible Leadership appealed the ruling, however, which automatically stayed the audit. The Fair Political Practices Commission asked an appeals court to lift the stay, but the court denied the request. Ann Ravel, the chairwoman of the commission, said her agency planned to ask the State Supreme Court to lift the stay, but acknowledged that voters would probably cast ballots on Tuesday without knowing who financed the Arizona group’s donation. “The voters are the losers in this,” she said.

Prediction Time: Obama Survives,2012-11-05,article,News,,[],In which I predict that the president wins the narrowest of narrow re-elections.,"As of this writing, my colleague Nate Silver’s election forecast has President Obama’s odds of re-election at 86 percent. The details of his famous forecasting method may be proprietary, but the argument, at this point, is straightforward: The President leads Mitt Romney by a small but solid margin in the state-level polling; that lead has been robust for weeks; state polling has historically been somewhat more accurate and currently provides a richer data set than the national polls where Romney’s numbers are slightly better; and the tight national polling could be consistent with an Obama electoral college win in any case. To pull the election out, Romney needs to win several states where the polls show him basically tied with the president (or even slightly behind, in some of the latest Virginia polling) and then win a state or two from a list (Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada, longer shots like Pennsylvania) where the polling has never really shown him doing anything but trailing. This is possible but unlikely; it has grown more unlikely with every passing day; and now “time is up” and Obama’s victory is nearly certain."

But 103? It happened last December, three days before Elliott Carter’s 103rd birthday, when an eager crowd packed the auditorium at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan for a concert of his works, performed by an impressive group of esteemed veterans and rising younger artists. Miraculously, Mr. Carter was there. And this program, organized by the cellist Fred Sherry, was no retrospective tribute but a fresh presentation of mostly recent works, including five scintillating pieces Mr. Carter had composed that year. There was also the premiere of a major 12-minute work for tenor (here the fine young singer Nicholas Phan) and 19-piece chamber ensemble, “A Sunbeam’s Architecture,” a song cycle with settings of six poems by E. E. Cummings. Mr. Carter wrote this restless, bracing score in 2010, back when he was just 101."

See It Now | George Nelson at Yale,2012-11-07,article,News,,[],One of the best-known American designers of the postwar era gets his first comprehensive retrospective.,"The exhibition “George Nelson: Architect, Writer, Designer, Teacher” opens on Thursday at the Yale School of Architecture Gallery, its final stop on a four-year international tour, where it will be on view until Jan. 26, 2013. The exhibition, which was organized by the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, includes more than 120 examples of furniture designs for home and office as well as over 50 drawings, models, photographs, films and other materials, and is the first comprehensive retrospective devoted to Nelson (1908-1986), one of the best-known American designers of the postwar era. Although he’s most famous for eye-catching designs like the Marshmallow Sofa, the Coconut Chair and the Ball Clock, Nelson — who was trained as an architect at Yale and was an influential editor at Architectural Forum magazine in the 1930s and ’40s — was most passionate about design’s role in the way people lived and worked. His 1945 book, “Tomorrow’s Houses” (with Henry Wright), espoused the family room and the storage wall; the latter, which was produced by Herman Miller, where Nelson was the director of design from 1945 to 1972, was one of his lasting contributions to the field. (He designed an L-shaped desk for Herman Miller that was a forerunner of the office workstation.) Among many other projects in his productive career, Nelson also did corporate image design for clients like General Electric and I.B.M.; he was the head designer for the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959; and he came up with a 64-foot-long car and a walk-in engine for Chrysler’s pavilion at the 1964 New York World’s Fair."

"36 Hours in Cancún, Mexico",2012-11-08,article,News,,['Travel and Vacations'],There’s more to Mexico’s top travel destination than alcohol-fueled partying. Take a look.,"BUILT from the sand up just 42 years ago to become what is now Mexico’s No. 1 travel destination, Cancún will likely always conjure images of spring break debauchery. But the city’s 17-mile-long hotel-zone peninsula, home to most of its 150 hotels and the site of a $71 million shoreline expansion in 2010, draws everyone from middle-class families to jet-setters. The best place to feel the city’s true pulse, though, is in the other Cancún: downtown, in the tangle of mostly tourist-free squares, market stalls and shiny new developments offering their own destination-worthy nightspots, shops and restaurants. Cancún has thus far dodged the bullet of drug-cartel violence: Its home state, Quintana Roo, was one of only 14 to be spared a spot on the State Department’s most recent Mexico travel warning."

Clean Burn | The Laundress Candles,2012-11-09,article,News,,[],"The company’s subtle, sophisticated scented detergents now have candles to match.","Though the scent of Tide will always have its fans (and there’s a Facebook page to prove it), few laundry detergents can claim the sort of passionate olfactory following enjoyed by the Laundress New York. The company’s subtle, sophisticated scents — more fragrance counter than cleaning aisle — are so addictive that they’ve prompted numerous customers to ask the Laundress co-founders, Lindsey Boyd and Gwen Whiting, to make candles to match. At long last, that wish has come true: The pair has just introduced a trio of candles in their most popular fragrances. Lady has an herbal, citrusy bouquet with notes of amber, lavender and bergamot; No. 247 is a gentle blend of bergamot, thyme, lavender, musk and ylang ylang; and Cedar’s woodsy notes of cedar and sandalwood are balanced out by orange and rose. Like the cleaning products that inspired them, the candles are subtly designed (the artist Daniela Kamiliotis, who drew the Laundress’s signature “Lady,” created the packaging), effective and eco-friendly."

Doubling Back,2012-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],John Banville’s hero stars in a movie version of events long past.,"In the trompe l’oeil universe of the versatile Irish novelist John Banville, things rarely happen just once. The actual event in a particular intersection of space and time — the secret tryst, the trusted friend betrayed — is filtered through a kaleidoscope of memory and dream, lies and subterfuge, hallucinations and ghosts. In Banville’s latest novel, “Ancient Light,” there is the added distorting mirror of a movie version of events long past. The biopic in which the narrator, an aging actor named Alexander Cleave, is unexpectedly invited to star — landing “this plum part without applying for it, without even an audition” — is called, to hammer home the point, “The Invention of the Past.”"

This event — every parent’s nightmare — opens John Schwartz’s memoir, “Oddly Normal,” a deeply affecting account of Joe’s learning to embrace his sexuality, as well as his parents’ efforts to shield him from homophobia and help him endure a school system that continues to marginalize (and even pathologize) kids who need special understanding."

In her startling first novel, “The Longshot,” the cage was literal, as an aging mixed martial arts fighter trained to re-enter the ring for a comeback, goaded by his gruff trainer. Kitamura’s new novel, “Gone to the Forest,” also crackles with an aura of tense masculine confinement, but here the cage is figurative, with two white farmers, one young, one old, in an unnamed colonial country battling to come to grips with what will soon be their postcolonial fate."

Who Made Velcro?,2012-11-09,article,News,,"['Birds', 'Inventions and Patents']",A man-made interpretation of nature’s glue that never wears out.,"In 1941, a Swiss engineer named George de Mestral returned from a hunting trip with burs clinging to his pants and tangled in his dog’s coat. When de Mestral examined the seedpods under a microscope, he marveled at how they bristled with hooks ingeniously shaped to grasp at animal fur. “Most people stop at the ‘Oh, that’s cool, that’s what nature does,’ ” says Janine Benyus, a pioneer in the field of biomimicry, the science of studying natural models — anthills and lizard feet, say — to solve human problems. “He probably had to go back a lot of times,” she adds, “and really look” at those hooks. A bur, of course, can clamp onto wool socks with surprising force, and — even more amazing — once you pry it off, it can stick again and again, like glue that never wears out. But how to imitate this trick with human-made stuff? Eventually de Mestral learned to mold nylon into a fabric studded with tiny hooks or loops that acted like artificial burs."

Their ideas have included casino gambling, an ’80s festival mall, new ballparks, hosting a Formula One grand prix, hosting a Super Bowl, even commissioning (this was Mayor Coleman Young, in 1984) Berry Gordy (who fled Detroit for Los Angeles by the early 1970s, taking the entire Motown operation with him) to write a city theme modeled after Frank Sinatra’s “Theme from New York, New York.” Another member of the Rat Pack, Sammy Davis Jr., was conscripted to handle the vocals, but sadly, Gordy’s song, “Hello, Detroit,” failed to burn up the charts."

The Girl in the Blue Dress,2012-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Eric Nuzum’s memoir opens a door to the emotional lives of America’s young.,"Among the weightier riddles orbiting the memoir, these days, is the reliability of the narrator. Since the advent of James Frey, at least, it has been the habit not only to greet a memoir with a torrent of legal inquiries but also to doubt the very accuracy of the voice telling us the story. Eric Nuzum’s “Giving Up the Ghost,” which is much concerned with the supernatural, is no exception. Nuzum’s account raises a clutch of questions about realism and memory. Because of this, I confess, and because I am schooled in memoirs involving psychiatric hospitals, I almost immediately began trying to come up with a diagnosis for the apparent unreliability of this narrator: borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, bipolar type II, addictive personality disorder, mixed anxiety-­depressive disorder and so on. Like sufferers of all these illnesses, Nuzum seems by turns lovable, charismatic, exhausting, irritating, self-destructive, impossible and sometimes plain dumb. And yet, by the end of the book, it’s hard to overlook just how effectively he has described the emotional lives of the American young."
Tour de Farce,2012-11-09,article,Review,,"['Tour de France (Bicycle Race)', 'Doping (Sports)', 'Books and Literature', 'Bicycles and Bicycling']","Tyler Hamilton, who rode with Lance Armstrong, tells of drug use in cycling.","“Hey dude, you got any Poe I can borrow?” The scene was Lance Armstrong’s villa in Nice, in 1999, the year that he first won the Tour de France, and the speaker was his teammate Tyler Hamilton. Or again: “Gonna visit Edgar. My old buddy Edgar.” These seemingly obscure allusions to the author of “The Raven” are explained as the plot — in more than one sense — unfolds in “The Secret Race,” Hamilton’s confessional memoir, written with Daniel Coyle. With its faults, the book is riveting enough, although today, some weeks after its publication, it reads like a trailer to the 200-page report from the United States Anti-Doping Agency released last month. This devastating indictment of the worst doping scandal — and the greatest conspiracy — yet seen in competitive sport led to the decision by the International Cycling Union, the cycling governing body, to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles and bar him from the sport for life. These are very dark times for bike racing."

Keeping Hope Alive,2012-11-09,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Blacks', 'Black People', 'Discrimination', 'Race and Ethnicity']",Three books highlight the struggle for racial equality in America.,"Before I picked up “Hand in Hand: Ten Black Men Who Changed America,” I moderated a panel called “When Work Disappears,” comprising an interracial group of lawyers, economists and a journalist turned television producer. And on the whole, the opinions and evidence we shared left the audience, as well as myself, in a “slough of despond.” Every aspect painted a bleak picture of African-Americans, including the tragic status of children living in poverty (38 percent); schools ill-equipped to meet students’ most basic needs; the disproportionate numbers in prison, most on relatively minor charges; and a rate of unemployment double that of whites. In short: The American dream for African-Americans — especially young men — is for now and the foreseeable future an American nightmare. "
Topsy-Turvy,2012-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Jon Agee and Oliver Jeffers embrace the absurd in two new picture books.,"There exists in children’s literature a tradition of stories best described as “absurd” or “nonsense.” Such books derive their legitimacy and longevity from the open-mindedness of the people for whom they are written. Young children are not, after all, as insistent as their elders that a story adhere to the rules of logic or the nature of reality. This acceptance of the absurd reflects their willingness, eagerness even, to suspend disbelief. A feeling of liberation lies behind this attraction: the antic, anything-goes quality of the deeply nonsensical story is fundamentally appealing to a child’s anarchic spirit."
Swimmies,2012-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An industrious tugboat and a mischievous fish discover that life is full of surprises.,"Jon Klassen’s “I Want My Hat Back” and Stephen Savage’s “Where’s Walrus?,” though two of the most widely anticipated Caldecott Medal contenders of 2012, didn’t, in the end, get much love from the American Library Association committee that chose the winning picture book, “A Ball for Daisy,” by Chris Raschka, along with three runners-­up. The deliberations are secret, so we cannot know the Caldecott committee’s thinking, but the single (if expert) joke of “Walrus” and the Raymond Carveresque minimalist murder plot of “Hat” were perhaps not pluses. Still, both books were strong sellers and brought deserved attention to their creators."

"
Avatars,2012-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Ned Vizzini’s teenage hero faces challenges in two realms.,"Ned Vizzini has been a professional writer, and a good one, since the 1990s, when he was 15 years old and emerged with a series of vibrant columns for The New York Press about teenage life. Later, one of his novels, “It’s Kind of a Funny Story,” became a critical and commercial hit, as well as a 2010 movie starring Zach Galifianakis. Vizzini was then, and continues to be now, in full possession of a clever, seductively deadpan voice, as the first few sentences of his new young adult novel, “The Other Normals,” bear out: “This is a story about becoming a man, so naturally it starts with me alone in a room playing with myself. Not that way — playing Creatures & Caverns, the popular role-playing game. Popular being a relative term. I guess if Creatures & Caverns were really popular, I would have other people to play with.”"
Whose Body Is It Anyway?,2012-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Two dystopian young adult novels challenge readers’ conceptions.,"One of the many pleasures of reading dystopian novels is encountering a different but recognizable world, and then uncovering clues to how things ended up this way and relishing the sense of discovery. Two new dystopian novels not only explore such alternative realms and the societies that populate them, but also probe the smaller worlds of human bodies and the souls that inhabit them. Both Rachel Cohn’s “Beta” and Kat Zhang’s “What’s Left of Me” offer meticulously crafted settings and unusual characters while posing fascinating questions about the nature of body and soul."

Tech Trouble,2012-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Two young adult novels imagine worlds affected by alarming technology.,"Books with plots that center on technology are rarely about that technology; rather, they are about the impact of that technology. In two new young adult novels, “Crewel” and “Eve & Adam,” we face two potentially alarming worlds: one in which technology has fundamentally altered the human body, and in the other, where it’s changed the very fabric of reality. And it’s up to a couple of teenage heroines to deal with it."
Histories of War,2012-11-09,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Holocaust and the Nazi Era']",The race to build the bomb and Jewish resistance in World War II are the subjects of two nonfiction books.,"Earlier this year, a British publisher told me something that made me especially proud to write nonfiction. Nowhere else in the world, he said, is nonfiction for young people written as it is in the United States, where authors often select their own subjects rather than have them handed down by a publisher; find their own images rather than farm the job out to a photo researcher; and work closely with designers to lay out each page. He is right: American nonfiction for children and teenage readers is often a labor of love. Two new books about war, Steve Sheinkin’s “Bomb” and Doreen Rappaport’s “Beyond Courage,” offer particular excellence — vivid writing and original research inspired by personal passion — in a field that all too often ­is invisible."

Stealing the Sunlight,2012-11-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A world run by children is upended in this environmental tale.,"In most children’s books, from “Little Bear” to “The Jungle Book,” nature exists as a kind of utopia, a lush playground with anthropomorphized animals. It’s rare to find stories that realistically depict the natural world — as a beautiful but fragile realm under siege. Is it because Dr. Seuss so brilliantly impugned the human race’s ecological crimes in “The Lorax” that another masterpiece in the genre has seemed beyond reach? Because our children are so screen-­addicted and nature-starved, we fear ­further exiling them from the outdoors with tales of environmental peril? Or maybe it’s because such stories would expose any grown-up who travels by aircraft or uses Ziploc baggies as an environmental offender. Whatever the reason, eco-lit needs more attention, and devotees will be pleased to discover a new addition from the Icelandic author Andri Snaer Magnason, who writes with a Seussian mix of wonder, wit and gravitas.

What to Listen to When Sipping a November Drink,2012-11-12,article,News,,"['ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES', 'Autumn (Season)']",Cider seems to go down better to a soundtrack of eerie ballads and tragic old love songs.,"Like drinking, music is seasonal, I think. And as I explain in my November Drink column, late autumn is definitely folk-music prime time for me. Cider seems to go down better to a soundtrack of eerie ballads and tragic old love songs, many of them dating back hundreds of years. I favor British folk and folk-rock artists like Shirley Collins, Ewan MacColl and Martin Carthy — and above all Sandy Denny, who died in 1978 at 31. (By then she’d made her mark with the legendary folk-rock outfit Fairport Convention, but she might forever be best known for her ethereal vocals on Led Zeppelin’s “Battle of Evermore.”) Her voice, at once primal and refined, is like a solitary walk through the woods in late autumn. As for younger British musicians, I’m smitten with the Unthanks, a Northumbrian band fronted by the sisters Rachel and Becky Unthank, whose rich, haunting harmonies are just right. But I can’t resist some of the greatest traditional American singers either — especially Jean Ritchie and Ralph Stanley."

Judge John Mitting ordered Abu Qatada, 52, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, to be released from prison on Tuesday under tight bail conditions. The ruling was a blow to the British government, which wants to rid the country of foreign-born radical clerics it says are fomenting Islamic militancy. British security officials say Mr. Othman was one of Al Qaeda’s top operatives in Europe. Previous attempts to deport him were blocked by the European Court of Human Rights over concerns that evidence obtained from others under torture might be used against him in Jordan. The preacher, who is of Palestinian descent, was convicted in absentia of involvement in two bombing plots in Jordan in 1999 and 2000, and faces a retrial if returned home. Home Secretary Theresa May said the government would appeal Monday’s ruling. “Qatada is a dangerous man,” she said. “The government has been doing everything it can to get rid of Abu Qatada, and we will continue to do so.” "

Tweet Couture | JF & Son at the Museum of Arts and Design,2012-11-13,article,News,,[],A design team takes residency at The Museum of Arts and Design. The project: to design clothes inspired by tweets.,"Though there’s a lot of talk about how technology has democratized fashion by bringing even the most recherché labels within the reach of anyone with an Internet connection, the conversation rarely turns to how that might extend beyond retail to the design studio. One such possibility is being explored by Jesse Finkelstein and Katie King of JF & Son, a label that’s renowned for its collaborative spirit. As part of their three-month residency at the Museum of Arts and Design, the two asked the public at large to tweet them a description of an item of clothing @jfandson. After the Nov. 16 deadline, they will send the tweets to their studio near Shanghai, where their production team will chose a collection’s worth and make clothes from them. “It’s a project that’s really speaking to what we want to do with the residency, which is connect consumers, designers and manufacturers,” Finkelstein explains. “We’re going to stay out of it in terms of deciding what’s going to get produced. It will be up to us to figure out how to fit everything together and display it as a collection.” The tweets so far have ranged from the prosaic to the poetic. “He kept the corners of his eyes for her grey ghost silhouette,” reads one; another requests “a bustle made of swarming crowds searching for popsicles and a duster coat spun of nightmares.” “We’ve done so many strange projects that our studio is used to it,” Finkelstein says of the unorthodox directives. “Anyway, we’ve been doing a bunch of sweatshirts, so I think they’re looking forward to working on something more interesting.” The collection will be on display at the Museum of Art and Design beginning on Jan. 8."

Virtually every American president since Dwight Eisenhower has had a Middle Eastern country that brought him grief. For Ike, it was Lebanon’s civil war and Israel’s Sinai invasion. For Lyndon Johnson, it was the 1967 Six-Day War. For Nixon, it was the 1973 war. For Carter, it was the Iranian Revolution. For Ronald Reagan, it was Lebanon. For George H.W. Bush, it was Iraq. For Bill Clinton, it was Al Qaeda and Afghanistan. For George W. Bush, it was Iraq and Afghanistan. For Barack Obama’s first term, it was Iran and Afghanistan, again. And for Obama’s second term, I fear that it could be the full nightmare — all of them at once. The whole Middle East erupts in one giant sound and light show of civil wars, states collapsing and refugee dislocations, as the keystone of the entire region — Syria — gets pulled asunder and the disorder spills across the neighborhood.

The panel, led by Charles Petrie, a former U.N. official, criticized what it called “a sustained and institutionalized reluctance” by staff members in Sri Lanka at the time “to stand up for the rights of the people they were mandated to assist.” The report’s executive summary says “many senior U.N. staff simply did not perceive the prevention of killing of civilians as their responsibility.” The report also found fault with the way senior officials in New York dealt with the crisis. Officials chose “not to speak up” about “broken commitments and violations of international law” by both the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels because that was seen as a way to increase access to victims of the conflict. A spokesman for Secretary General Ban Ki-moon refused to comment on the draft but said the final report would be made public soon. Lyse Doucet, the chief international correspondent for BBC News who obtained the draft, reported Tuesday that the executive summary, “which sets out the panel’s conclusions in stark terms,” was removed from the final report.

Can American Diplomacy Ever Come Out of Its Bunker?,2012-11-14,article,News,,"['Diplomatic Service, Embassies and Consulates', 'United States International Relations', 'Terrorism', 'Security and Warning Systems', 'Benghazi Attack (2012)']","With the ever-rising need for security abroad, what can American diplomacy accomplish in the fragile nations that need it most?","When Ronald Neumann began his Foreign Service career in the early 1970s, he sometimes carried a pistol to protect himself. It was a reasonable precaution. American diplomats in those days lived without benefit of blast walls or security advisers, even in volatile countries, and consulates were at times housed on the ground floors of apartment buildings, with local families living on the upper stories. Neumann worked with a freedom that is scarcely imaginable for many diplomats today; he could go anywhere, by himself, and talk to anyone. In the early ’80s, when he was the deputy mission chief in Yemen, Neumann got wind of a threat to burn down the embassy building in the capital, Sana. The Arab world was in turmoil at the time, after an Israeli invasion of Lebanon and months of mounting violence. Much of the anger was directed at Americans. The embassy was easily accessible to any passer-by, an ordinary house in a residential neighborhood with no police protection. But Neumann — whose boss was out of the country at the time — did not close it down. Then things became more serious: there were rumors that angry Palestinians in Sana were planning to attack Neumann’s house. Neumann, a taciturn Vietnam veteran, took it in stride. “I brought a shotgun home from the embassy and locked the front gate,” Neumann told me. “My wife asked me if there was anything else we could do. I told her no. So she said, ‘In that case I’ve got some curtains I’ve been meaning to wash; I might as well do it now.’ I remember thinking, This is probably how they handled it when the Indian raids went down in the old West; just stay inside and mend the saddles.”"

In an introduction to “The Best American Essays 2007” he explained the qualities he looked for as a reader. He praised essays showcasing “what a first-rate artistic mind can make of particular fact-sets” — whether those involve cellphone ring tones, the meaning of stage fright or the “near-infinity of ways to experience and describe an earthquake.” He celebrated the qualities of “clarity, precision, plainness, lucidity and the sort of magical compression that enriches instead of vitiates.” And he looked at how pieces “handle and respond to the tsunami of available fact, context and perspective” that constitutes our “Total Noise” culture today — a culture that so overwhelms us with data and rhetoric and spin that it’s difficult to absorb, much less try to make sense of.

The screening is curated by the artist Casey Jane Ellison, who started an online archive and exhibition platform when she was a student at the Art Institute of Chicago. “I wanted to create awareness for animation,” explains Ellison, whose hilarious alter ego, Case Case, is the anchor of the online pop culture journal Status Update. “So rather than people uploading their work individually on YouTube, I thought it was important to create a more curated context.” The selection of films will run the gamut from digital to analog — full-on C.G.I. to hand-drawn or stop-motion animation. Participating artists include Robert Bittenbender, Cody Critcheloe, Erin Dunn, Steve Emmons, Lauren Gregory, Ryan Whittier Hale, Rhett LaRue, Jacolby Satterwhite, Monira Al Qadiri and Lale Westvind, as well as Ellison herself, who will moderate a post-screening discussion. So what made her get into animation in the first place? “When I was little, I watched an episode of ‘The Sopranos’ featuring a dream sequence in which Tony is interacting with an animated fish,” Ellison says, laughing. “I remember being really affected by the emotion conveyed in that scene, and the element of surprise. That’s when animation is really good — when you don’t know where it’s coming from.”"

What’s on Thursday,2012-11-15,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) CROSSFIRE HURRICANE (2012) The director Brett Morgen culls from more than 1,000 hours of film, 500 hours of audio and 80 hours of new interviews to chronicle the 50-year history of the Rolling Stones and their transformation from, as Mick Jagger says, “the band everybody hated to the band everybody loves.” What sets the band apart from the rest? “A chemical reaction seems to have happened,” says Keith Richards (above, second from left, with his band mates Charlie Watts, left, Bill Wyman, Mr. Jagger and Ronnie Wood). “You can’t really stop the Rolling Stones. You know when that sort of avalanche is facing you, you just get out of the way.” Among the documentary’s highlights are depictions of the chaos that accompanied the band’s early tours; the birth of the Jagger-Richards songwriting partnership; the death of the guitarist Brian Jones in 1969 and the terror later that year at the Altamont Festival, where four people died; and Mr. Richards’s 1977 drug arrest in Toronto, which threatened to break up the band. In a recent interview with Jon Pareles in The New York Times, Mr. Richards pronounced himself amazed at the band’s longevity. “There is a certain magnetic glue that pulls us all together, that overrides any other peripheral things,” he said. “Once we get behind our instruments, there’s something bigger. The sum is greater than the parts. There’s just a feeling that we were meant to do this, we have to do this, and we’re just following the trail.” "

In the last few years, Ljubljana has seen several notable museum openings, a new public bike-rental program and a major renovation of its Hapsburg-era opera house. With the country surrounded by Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, the national cuisine is infused with a cornucopia of influences; the capital’s latest restaurants are bypassing novelty and getting creative with traditional Slovenian fare. There are also surprisingly offbeat facets of the city, like Metelkova City, a cluster of clubs and galleries that opened inside a complex of former military buildings after Slovenia declared independence, in 1991. Elsewhere, remnants of a Roman wall built around A.D. 15 share a block with boxy Communist office buildings and Art Nouveau mansions from Austro-Hungarian times.

If you were happy with the ideological situation on the right, you’ve probably either emphasized the practical deficiencies of the Romney campaign (his weaknesses as a candidate, his flawed turnout operation, his pollster’s rose-colored glasses), or else looked for a supposed silver bullet like immigration reform to solve the Republican Party’s demographic issues without touching the rest of the party platform. If you’re socially conservative and populist but skeptical of Wall Street and big business, then you’ve probably argued the party’s biggest mistake was to nominate a plutocrat and run a campaign tilted too far toward economic individualism and the interests of the rich. If you’re fiscally conservative but libertarian on social issues, then you’ve probably made the case that Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock and anti-immigrant yahoos took the focus off the economy, and that cultural conservatives need to pipe down and let the party modernize on gay rights, immigration and abortion. If you’re David Frum, who has been arguing that the party needs to be more middle class friendly and more socially liberal, then you’ve been claiming vindication on both counts."

But what about the more under-the-radar story lines? Here are six developments to keep your eyes on.Rajon Rondo’s midrange shooting: It seems no discussion of Rondo’s place in the current N.B.A. is complete without a proper hand-wringing over the guard’s notoriously inconsistent jumper. So far at least, that qualm has been muted, as Rondo, Boston’s floor general, has quietly put up some of the best shooting numbers of his career: a true shooting percentage (which accounts for free throws and 3-point field goals) of 53 percent, including 50 percent from 16 to 24 feet, and 67 percent from 8 to 16 feet.

As is often the case, he was working as much with myth as reality, but that didn’t lessen the catharsis. Mr. Dylan, who recently released his 35th studio album, “Tempest” (Columbia), understands more than anyone how carefully his words are parsed. So there may be reason to anticipate a similar gesture at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday. During recent stops on his Never Ending Tour, he has played “The Levee’s Gonna Break,” his liberal revision of “When the Levee Breaks,” a blues account of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927."

The Sense of an Ending,2012-11-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Alice Munro’s latest story collection includes “the first and last — and the closest — things I have to say about my own life.”,"That Alice Munro, now 81, is one of the great short story writers not just of our time but of any time ought to go without saying by now. This new volume — her 14th, not counting a collection of selected stories that came out in 1996 — is further proof of her mastery, and also a reminder that unlike a lot of accomplished short story writers — unlike William Trevor, say, her only living rival — Munro did not hit a characteristic note early on and then stick with it. Over the years her work has deepened and enlarged. At the end of “Dear Life” is a suite of four stories that Munro says are “autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact,” and she adds: “I believe they are the first and last — and the closest — things I have to say about my own life.” They seem to me as good as anything she has ever done, but also to strike out in the direction of a new, late style — one that is not so much a departure as a compressing or summing up of her whole career."

Making a guess, I stuck my head through the doorway of what seemed to be an abandoned building with peeling plaster and dingy windows. Inside, weird paintings decorated the walls, and rough-hewn furniture had been cobbled together.

Class Notes,2012-11-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Tessa Hadley’s stories observe subtle differences and what they signify.,"Class hurts. Its injuries — as small as a paper cut, or as large as the difference between the 99 and the 1 percent — carry with them an exponential degree of shame. One often hears that we in the United States are in denial about class, but it might be more accurate to say that we maintain a tight-lipped silence about differences we can all see perfectly well. We know the relative rankings of brands, schools, addresses, food and body mass indexes; we understand understatement. We even understand about understanding understatement and rejecting its clenched, single-strand-of-pearls aspirations. We did, after all, invent Target. In contemporary American fiction, class markers aren’t in short supply, nor are writers shy about using them. George Saunders and Deborah Eisenberg come to mind as American writers who are deeply aware of class — he the lower, she the upper middle — and who have each created an aesthetics founded in the sensibility of these ever-vexed class positions. We can pretty much tell where their characters are likely to shop. "

He is supremely learned, wearing his gigantic erudition ostentatiously on both sleeves. He can prestidigitate with prestigious quotations from, and references to, everything from the Vedas to Hollywood. His new book to us (in ­Italy it is already penultimate) is “La Folie Baudelaire,” with the folly perhaps as much Calasso’s as Charles Baudelaire’s, equaled only by that of the unsuspecting reader embarking on a hoped-for smooth sail. As Calasso himself might put it, “Caveat lector!”"

We were very likely in a discussion of the long poems of T. S. Eliot (“The Waste Land” had originally been called “He Do the Police in Different Voices,” and his “Sweeney Agonistes” includes blackface) or of John Berryman (who used minstrel show structures and dialect in “The Dream Songs” as late as 1969).

The Outsiders,2012-11-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Dan Josefson’s hero navigates the social world of a therapeutic boarding school in upstate New York.,"“That’s Not a Feeling,” Dan Josefson’s mordant, cockeyed first novel about a boarding school in upstate New York, includes, as many fantasy novels also do, a hand-drawn map of his invented world. Downhill from the gym, we see, is the ski-lodge-like cafetorium, which sits just behind the converted mansion used as an administrative building, itself uphill from a swath of pine trees known as “the Enchanted Forest.” Josefson could have reasonably included a glossary as well, as his Roaring Orchards School for Troubled Teens comes equipped with its own abstruse vocabulary. Students are classified, almost like Grammy Award nominees, as Alternative, New or Regular. Teachers do not restrain students; they “wiggle” them. Yummies are forbidden, and fibs must be turned in; students who break these rules can be sheeted, skirted, cornered, ghosted or roomed, or have their furniture popped.

Everything, from worn-in leather wallets to antique-inspired beaded bracelets, is priced at $39.99. “I love that you can see the entirety of every collection on one page,” Alpert says. “I want our customers to be able to shop without distractions and just focus on the designs in front of them.” Pulling from previous experience as the designer for the boho jewelry line Ruby Kobo, Alpert’s first collection for Men In Cities is filled with easy, simple pieces that are enough to wear to the office (think muted silver cuffs and a deep blue bracelet with a small skull pendant). “I wanted everything to be straightforward. I design items that I feel work well together,” he says. “My personal style is T-shirt, jeans, accessories. But If you feel like a rock star and want to wear 10 bracelets at a time, go for it. We want men to be able to add character to their own look, just a touch of formality with a cravat or tie clip.” Men In Cities also offers styling tips, via illustrated guides. “The idea’s to introduce men to a new way of thinking,” he says. “There’s no right or wrong — it’s what you feel comfortable with.”"

New On Savile Row | The Alexander McQueen Men’s Store,2012-11-19,article,News,,[],"The men’s flagship store on Savile Row in London was designed in the spirit of McQueen’s major muses like the arts, nature and military pageantry.","Not much about the new Alexander McQueen men’s flagship (the world’s first) on Savile Row in London suggests the dark, dour designs that the late artist was often earmarked for. Not even the colors. The designer’s posthumous homecoming to the street where, at age 16, he worked as an apprentice at the bespoke tailors Anderson and Sheppard and then at the neighboring Gieves and Hawkes, seems a fitting return to the company’s British tailoring roots. Working hard to elevate McQueen men’s wear to a higher level of detail and tailoring, the creative director, Sarah Burton, worked closely with David Collins Studio to outfit the store’s interiors in the spirit of McQueen’s major muses like the arts, nature and military pageantry. Inside, the shop’s walls recall the faded grandeur of stately English homes, clad as they are with white plaster panels and acanthus carvings that, up close, are compounded barnacles, feathers and foxgloves. This play on nature continues throughout the store; display cases and tables stand on clawed feet, and tall mirrors are propped up by what appear to be squirrels. A narrow strip of red carpet meant to invoke a military procession traces a line down the center of the store, atop which stands a colonnade of brass clothes railings carved to look like a vertebrate. Perhaps the biggest extravagance is the back-of-house glass inspiration cube curated by Sadie Coles. The first exhibited work is a Sarah Lucas sculpture, “Icon,” from her “Bunny” series, that portrays the British dancer Michael Clark. Of course the point and legal stipulation of keeping a store on Savile Row is that there will be in-house tailors busy at work and visible from the street in their basement workshop. An important detail, among many, that the new McQueen store doesn’t overlook."

"Easy to Wrap, Ready to Rock ’n’ Roll",2012-11-19,article,List,,['Music'],"For fans of Charles Mingus, the Jackson 5, Heart and Amy Winehouse, among others, new gems and old.","AMY WINEHOUSE: ‘AT THE BBC’ This is a smart response to an awful reality. When Amy Winehouse died last year, it was unclear how much unreleased music remained. But there was still room to fill out her legacy, as this CD and DVD collection, which gathers recordings she made for various BBC productions over the course of her career, attests to. Musically, the performances are taut, all the better to steady Winehouse as she sang, which was necessary because even as far back as 2004, she could be as wobbly as she was ferocious. Live, she could play it straight, or indifferent, or aggressive, her voice an otherworldly mumble. When she roared, like on a 2006 “Tears Dry on Their Own” captured on the DVD here, it gleamed, and she brought real sass to standards like “Lullaby of Birdland.” The 2007 take on “You Know I’m No Good” is eerie, cutting and woozy. And some recordings open old wounds — is the barely-there “Love Is a Losing Game” from 2009 emaciated by aesthetic strategy or failing health? The DVD, an hourlong documentary about a 2006 performance backed only by guitar and bass in a tiny Irish church for about 100 people, is indulgent apart from the exquisite performance clips and snippets of an interview in which Winehouse recalls being flabbergasted by Thelonious Monk and Ray Charles in her youth. Performances like the ones in this set are too often considered detritus, less essential than an artist’s formal releases. But this collection reflects the breadth and power and, yes, wisdom of the BBC, the state-owned broadcaster that performs an outsize role in British cultural life, and with releases like this, may also be the nation’s official eulogizer as well.

Miracle on 10th Street | ‘Magic Fingers’ Opens at Last,2012-11-19,article,News,,['Art'],"“Magic Fingers,” a new experimental art space, hosted an intimate inauguration last Saturday night with “Questionable Beliefs; Part 3,” an exhibition by the artist Danny McDonald.","It made perfect sense that “Magic Fingers” — a new experimental art space in the East Village — would make its debut on Halloween given the theatrical cover this holiday provides, but the opening had been postponed twice because of Hurricane Sandy. Instead, the pop-up gallery hosted an intimate inauguration last Saturday night with “Questionable Beliefs; Part 3,” an exhibition by the artist Danny McDonald. The evening began with various set pieces trickling out from the diminutive storefront: first a fortune teller, then Turkish delights dispensed from an emergency rations box, black light manicures administered curbside, a purple question mark funerary wreath was brought forth. McDonald is a veteran on the downtown scene having worked under Colin de Land at his American Fine Arts Gallery in SoHo during its ’90s heyday. The artist intended his presentation at Magic Fingers to read as a “tableau vivant in the form of a theatricized political cartoon.” As darkness fell, the curator Alison Gingeras emerged sweeping a witch’s broom, presumably to clear the area for McDonald’s alter ego Mindy Vale, who masquerades as a Gypsy horror drag queen. Minutes later with a dead megaphone in hand, Vale popped out of the front window lamenting the loss of electricity and the kinds of hardships many New Yorkers have suffered of late and then, sitting on step stool, proceeded to cut up $100 bill doormats and toss sections into the crowd as a symbolic Robin Hood gesture. The event’s crescendo was Vale’s karaoke performance of the Oliver Twist song “Who Will Buy?” before she ran up the block with three pink balloons headed for the after-party at The Pyramid Club. As Gingeras obliquely summed up the performance, “Mindy is the perfect ambassador to preside over this return to the East Village.”"

New (Kids) Label Alert | Ella’s Wool,2012-11-19,article,News,,[],"A Norwegian shares her secret to year-round, outdoor play: comfortable knitwear.","A year ago, Vibeke Kvan Johansen noticed that in the span of two weeks her local Brooklyn playground went from teeming with about 200 children to having just 5 or so on its jungle gyms. The weather, of course, had become cold. But the emptiness was still strange to her; in Johansen’s native Norway, where “a warm day is 30 Fahrenheit,” children frolic outside all year long. The secret: a layer of not-at-all-itchy merino wool under their clothing (right against the skin). Johansen, a former hair and makeup artist and mother to Ella, 4, and Mikkel, 17 months, asked nannies and parents in her neighborhood what their little ones had on beneath their outerwear, and not one said wool. So, she’s made it her mission to spread the woolly word, bringing Nordic knitwear brands to the United States and selling their bodysuits, leggings, hats and more on her Web site, ellaswool.com. Why wool? It’s a heat regulating material, absorbs 30 percent of its weight in moisture before feeling wet, is softer than cotton and is better for those with allergies or sensitive skin. But perhaps its best benefit is that it allows children to play outdoors when the temperature drops, which, if you’re a parent is always a good thing. (Active children eat all their dinner and go right to bed!) “It’s my mission to have as many kids as possible outside to play all year long — with style,” Johansen says. “I already see myself as the wool queen,” she adds with a laugh. “Maybe not of the U.S. yet, but at least of Park Slope.”"

The Not So Swiss Chalet,2012-11-20,article,News,,['ALPINE SKIING'],"Fifteen years in the making, the $337 million Alpina Gstaad is the first completely new five-star hotel to arrive in the famous Swiss ski village in a century.","Fifteen years in the making, the $337 million Alpina Gstaad is the first completely new five-star hotel to arrive in the famous Swiss ski village in a century. It opens this month in one of Gstaad’s most exclusive sections, Oberbort, a residential patch in the shadow of the Bernese Alps that’s sprinkled with multimillion-franc ski retreats and roaming dairy cows. As much as the Alpina summons the rich chalet atmosphere one would expect to find in Gstaad — fireplaces, goat-hair throws, fondue — there is much about it that’s refreshingly exotic to Switzerland. And that suits Onno Poortier, the Dutch-born hotelier behind the project, just fine. “There are enough traditional hotels in Gstaad,” he said. To start, the 21,500-square-foot Six Senses Spa comes from Thailand. (It has a Himalayan salt room and an appealingly primitive cave that’s used for couples’ massages). The cigar lounge was inspired by one inside the Partagás cigar factory in Cuba. There’s a Swiss stübli eatery specializing in fondues and raclettes, but also a branch of the extravagant Japanese restaurant Megu. Even the price scheme seems a strange hybrid: rooms start at about $910 per night, but that includes a $320 credit to spend on après-ski cocktails, among other things. The hotel jealously guards its Alpine serenity. Cars arrive not in a typical driveway entrance but in an underground passageway lined with hand-chiseled stone; it keeps exhaust fumes away and the air of privilege mountain-fresh."

Invisible Economy,2012-11-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Aman Sethi delves into the tenuous lives of homeless laborers in one of India’s largest cities.,"People rooting in garbage dumps are a common sight in every Indian city, but the poor are rarely visible in the media, mainly because well-off urban Indians have little interest in their lives. In a country with more poor people than in the 26 most impoverished countries in Africa combined, this apathy is a failure not merely of intellectual curiosity, but of moral instinct. Aman Sethi’s first book, “A Free Man,” addresses this vacuum through the narratives of a small group of Delhi’s marginal, manual laborers: construction workers, rickshaw pullers, porters."

I Spy,2012-11-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The heroine of Ian McEwan’s novel goes to work for MI5.,"Ian McEwan’s work falls into two distinct periods. His early stories and novels were all cool post-1960s perversity, a high-end parade of deadpan macabre and kink and sideshow eccentricity: ghastly death, corpses and butchery, bestiality, incest and pedophilia, insanity, dwarves. But since he turned 50, around the turn of the century, he’s published lovely historical fiction about the disastrous sexual misunderstandings of youth (“Atonement,” “On Chesil Beach”), and contemporary fiction about an ­alternative-energy researcher (“Solar”) and a deeply sane, happily married surgeon (“Saturday”). It’s as if Johnny Rotten had changed into Bono. And in the same way I like both the Sex Pistols and U2, I’ve enjoyed the best of McEwan’s fiction in both modes."
Without Reservation,2012-11-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Sherman Alexie’s stories explore the dissonance and alienation of contemporary Native American life.,"In his 1936 essay “The Storyteller,” Walter Benjamin drew a sharp distinction between prose fiction, meaning novels and short stories, and actual storytelling, meaning spoken narratives passed from one individual to another. The essential quality of storytelling, Benjamin wrote, is lived experience: “Every story contains, openly or covertly, something useful . . . a moral; some practical advice; a proverb or maxim. In every case the storyteller has counsel for his readers. But if today ‘having counsel’ has an old-fashioned ring, this is because the communicability of experience is decreasing. . . . We have no counsel either for ourselves or for others.”"

Subtle and Brutal,2012-11-21,article,Review,,"['United States Defense and Military Forces', 'United States Politics and Government', 'Books and Literature']",Evan Thomas argues that Dwight D. Eisenhower was a brilliantly canny peacekeeper.,"Evan Thomas’s “Ike’s Bluff: President Eisenhower’s Secret Battle to Save the World” is an examination of Dwight Eisenhower’s record that seeks to understand how he successfully kept the United States out of a major war during the eight years of his presidency. It is in keeping with the recent trend in complimentary revisionist histories of the administration, like “Eisenhower in War and Peace,” by Jean Edward Smith, and “Eisenhower: The White House Years,” by Jim Newton. Thomas tells us that once Eisenhower “extricated America from the Korean War in 1953,” his mission was to “avoid any war.” For that reason, Thomas, who teaches writing and journalism at Princeton and is the author of several books, concentrates on Eisenhower’s foreign policy and national security decisions to the exclusion of almost everything else. The president’s civil rights record, for example, is mentioned only briefly, and as a demonstration of his leadership talents."

Doctors acknowledged that she was having a miscarriage, but over the course of three days, they reportedly refused to terminate the pregnancy and end her suffering because they could detect a fetal heartbeat.

Mr. Sarkozy was not formally indicted but questioned as a witness under caution, meaning that evidence obtained could be used against him in a future prosecution, the Bordeaux prosecutor told French news agencies. The accusations stem from Mr. Sarkozy’s first presidential campaign; no longer president, he has lost his legal immunity. Mr. Sarkozy denies that he took any money from Ms. Bettencourt, now 90, or that his campaign benefited from any illegal fund-raising. Ms. Bettencourt’s former accountant told the police that she handed over 150,000 euros (about $192,000) in cash and was told the money would go to the Sarkozy campaign. Mr. Sarkozy’s party, the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, is in the midst of a prolonged and bitter leadership fight. A Sarkozy protégé, Jean-François Copé, and a former prime minister, François Fillon, both claim victory in an internal party vote.

Sephardic Jews already benefit from a preferential naturalization procedure that requires them to live in Spain for only two years before claiming citizenship, but the change means that Jews will have to present only a certificate confirming their ancestry to claim a Spanish passport. The government did not say how many Jews it expected to apply for citizenship, but it noted that a large number of Sephardic Jews lived in Turkey and across Latin America. While estimates differ, the number of Jews living in Spain — 25,000 to 45,000 people in a population of 47 million — is only a fraction of the number who lived in the country before 1492, when Jews were told to convert to Christianity or go into exile.

What’s on Thursday,2012-11-29,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"6:45 A.M. (MoreMax) BEGINNERS (2011) In the first of two father-and-son tales starring Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer (above left, with Mr. McGregor), in an Oscar-winning role, plays Hal, the septuagenarian father of Oliver (Mr. McGregor), for whom he has two announcements: that he is gay and that he has terminal cancer. This film from the writer and director Mike Mills weaves together two love stories, one past and one present, that gradually fuse into a single life. Goran Visnjic plays Hal’s much younger partner; Mélanie Laurent is Anna, the French actress who sweeps Oliver away from his misery; and a scene-stealing Cosmo is Arthur, Hal’s Jack Russell terrier. “So much of ‘Beginners’ seems, looks, sounds, feels so hermetically perfect you may long for some air to blow, stir and even mess up its bright Los Angeles homes, the swanky old hotel where Anna stays and all these precious moments,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Even so, the movie’s attractions are undeniable, including its narrative design, which seems more complex than it is, but is engaging to piece together. And the performers are charming, particularly Ms. Laurent and Mr. Plummer, with his killer eyes (still seducing after all these years) and a voice that echoes in your ears.” In “Big Fish” (2003), at 6:50 p.m. on HBO Signature, Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom (Mr. McGregor is his youthful version), a traveling salesman from Alabama who has spent a lifetime embellishing the truth in this fantasy from Tim Burton, adapted from the novel by Daniel Wallace. Billy Crudup is Bloom’s estranged son, Will, a reporter in Paris who has been summoned home for a deathbed reconciliation, during which Edward elaborates on his biography. Edward’s doctor asks: Wouldn’t Will prefer to believe that on the day of his birth his father was subduing a legendary catfish rather than selling household gadgets in Wichita? “The movie insists that the only possible answer is yes, and thus chooses maudlin moonshine over engagement with the difficulties of real life, which is exactly the choice Edward has made,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. "

Spielberg’s “Lincoln” and Its Critics,2012-11-29,article,News,,[],Is this fall’s big historical film unfair to radicalism?,"In the wide-ranging online conversation about Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner’s “Lincoln,” it’s been interesting to watch the movie be praised and criticized for the same artistic choice: Its determinedly narrow focus on the month or so of politicking and debate that pushed the 13th Amendment through a reluctant House of Representatives. To the film’s fans — my op-ed colleague David Brooks and A.O. Scott are in-house examples, but there are many others — this narrowing brings the democratic process to life in a way that few political movies ever have, capturing “the squalor and vigor, the glory and corruption of the Republic in action,” as Scott puts it, and throwing Lincoln’s distinctive balance of provisional cynicism and ultimate idealism into sharp relief. To its various detractors, this narrowing is a betrayal of the true story of emancipation, which was actually settled on the ground more than in the halls of Congress, through the agency of slaves as much as by the votes of politicians, and which failed to deliver fully on its promises (thanks to Reconstruction’s failures, and Jim Crow’s ascendance) precisely because of the kind of compromises that “Lincoln” the film treats as the better part of political valor."

What’s on Friday,2012-11-30,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"2:20 P.M. (Starz) ORANGES AND SUNSHINE (2011) Emily Watson, above with Hugo Weaving, portrays Margaret Humphreys, a social worker in Nottingham, England, who, starting in 1986, exposed the deportation of as many as 130,000 children from orphanages and group homes in Britain to Australia between the 1940s and 1967. One deportee, now an adult, recalls being told at 10 that he was being sent to a sunny paradise where he could pick oranges off trees. Instead, many of the youngsters found themselves forced into hard labor and enduring physical cruelty and sexual abuse at places like the Bindoon Boys Town, presided over by the Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order. The victims were informed that their parents were dead, while their parents — mainly unwed mothers deemed unfit — were told that their children had been placed for adoption in better homes. “This film presents a chilling portrait of bureaucratic stonewalling and denial as Margaret presents her evidence to politicians who meet her accusations with indifference and skepticism, express only a vague regret and assume no responsibility,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, directed by Jim Loach from Ms. Humphreys’s 1994 book, “Empty Cradles.” “When she eventually faces a group of clergymen at Bindoon, she is met with absolute silence.” He added: “Rona Munro’s screenplay for ‘Oranges and Sunshine’ is unnecessarily flighty. As the story ricochets between Britain and Australia, the film often loses track of time and becomes fragmented as it struggles to integrate too many subplots. What holds it together is Ms. Watson’s calm, sturdy performance.”"
Russian Court Ruling Seeks to Ban Pussy Riot’s Videos,2012-11-30,article,Brief,,"['Freedom of Speech and Expression', 'Music', 'Decisions and Verdicts']","A Moscow court ruled that videos of performances by the punk group were extremist, falling under a law intended to rein in hate speech."," A Moscow court on Thursday ruled that videos of performances by the punk group Pussy Riot were extremist, falling under a law intended to rein in hate speech. The court called for limiting public access to Web sites and blogs displaying the videos. But the ruling is unlikely to cut off access to them, since it applies only to servers in Russia. One video from February shows band members in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior beseeching the Virgin Mary to rid Russia of Vladimir V. Putin, who was returned to the presidency in March. Last summer, three of the performers were sentenced to two years in a penal colony. An appeals court released one of them on bail in October. Thursday’s ruling cited “psycho-linguistic research” proving that the videos “humiliate various social groups based on their religious beliefs” and contain “hidden calls to rebellion and nonsubmission to authority.” "

Photo Fiction,2012-11-30,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Photography']","The British photographer Tim Walker has become known for collaborating with a team of makeup artists, painters and builders to construct elaborate sets full of ingenious props.","Telling stories with pictures is not new. In the 1950s, Richard Avedon famously used a series of fashion photographs to construct fictional narratives, a technique affectionately depicted in the film “Funny Face,” in which Audrey Hepburn, posing for a fashion story inspired by “Anna Karenina,” asks the Avedon character, played by Fred Astaire, if she should throw herself in front of a train. The narrative powers of fashion photography have continued to play a central role here; in fact the Museum of Modern Art’s first exhibition devoted exclusively to the genre was entitled “Fashioning Fiction in Photography Since 1990.” In recent years, technical developments in digital photography have led many photographers to tell stories by artificially enhancing or manipulating their images on the computer. By contrast, the British photographer Tim Walker has become known for collaborating with a team of makeup artists, painters and builders to construct elaborate sets full of ingenious props. "

I studied with her for four years, and took every class she offered: from Beginnings, through Scene Class, finally to Script Analysis, which was both the most daunting and the most electrifying. The excitement came because of Stella’s delivery, which was very theatrical but real, because Stella was nothing if not theatrical and real.

Cultural Artifacts,2012-11-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Orhan Pamuk’s guidebook to the museum he created to accompany the novel “The Museum of Innocence.”,"Toward the end of Orhan Pamuk’s 2008 novel “The Museum of Innocence,” there are a dozen pages of exhilarated writing on what the act of collecting can mean. After a brief, passionate love affair with a distant cousin named Fusun, the narrator, Kemal, obsessively amasses objects that evoke their relationship in 1970s Istanbul. He has become, he says, “the anthropologist of my own experience.” As Kemal grows older he takes to visiting unlikely museums in the cities he passes through, from those that dramatize the lives of artists, writers and architects — Gustave Moreau, John Soane, Cézanne, Mario Praz — to such particular institutions as the Museo del Mare in Trieste and the Musée du Temps, a clock museum in Besançon, France. In visiting these ­places, Kemal’s sense of what is possible in the disposition of objects grows ever deeper. As he views “the playing cards, rings, necklaces, chess sets and oil paintings of the State Museum of Württemberg,” he becomes convinced that Fusun’s possessions “deserved display in comparable splendor.” He realizes that objects beget narrative, just as stories need objects. (In a twist, it becomes clear in the closing pages that the novel is actually narrated by Pamuk — a novelist hired to tell the story.)"

Looking at art, then, is a discipline Paglia believes will help us retrieve the necessary stillness that can “realign our senses and produce a magical tranquillity.” Hence “Glittering Images,” a primer of sorts that takes its reader on a tour of 29 of Paglia’s favorite artworks, a list that includes the “Laocoön”; Donatello’s “Mary Magdalene”; paintings by Jacques-Louis David, Monet and Picasso; as well as examples of more recent trends like Pop, Conceptual, Land and Performance Art.

The crudely endearing charms of Lauper’s book, a memoir of her unglamorous outer-borough upbringing and not entirely glamorous life since MTV made her a pop star in the 1980s, are its unpretentious attitude and its blunt, brassy voice. “Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir” is boisterous, erratic, sometimes goofy and — very much like its author’s music, in all this — not quite as dumb as it may seem."

A purveyor of quotable, gnomic epigrams, ready-made images pinched from popular culture, and experimental films in which nearly nothing happens, Warhol, who died in 1987, was the most famous of the Pop artists. Art world sophisticates also credit him with a major role in the death of painting, which was written off as a medium in the 1960s, and with opening up the sacrosanct domain of art to every kind of subject matter — from celebrity portraits and Brillo boxes to adventures in drag and ads for plastic surgery."
