‘UnREAL’ Season 2 Finale: Trust Me,2016-08-09,article,Review,,['Television'],This episode’s final glimpse of Quinn and Rachel tells us that the show remembers what matters.

The Return of the Gothic Lip,2016-08-09,article,News,,"['Cosmetics and Toiletries', 'Beauty (Concept)']",The latest iteration is more nostalgic indulgence than rebellious statement. But it still has a defiant power.,"“Insensitive to red,” a heartbreaking phrase, is technically a description of early black-and-white film, which converted the colors of blood and red lipstick to black. Elsa Lanchester’s lips were painted redder than her auburn hair for 1935’s “The Bride of Frankenstein”; the makeup artist on the film based her look on a 3,300-year-old bust of Nefertiti, who announced her power by blackening her eyes, reddening her lips and dyeing her nails with dark henna. But when Lanchester appeared on screen as the Bride — “She’s alive!” — her overdrawn mouth looked dark as hell: Et voilà, the modern gothic lip was born. Robert Smith of the Cure, whose lipstick emphasized not the Cupid’s bow but the corners of his mouth, giving him the moue of a dissatisfied cannibal, was said to inspire the almost-black “goth lip” of the 1990s; he only, in fact, wore the ’60s designer Mary Quant’s Crimson Scorcher. But what are facts when it comes to what we see? Color depends on perception, and our perception, so dependent on lighting, changes over the years the way light does over the course of a day. Sometimes we’re desensitized to red, and so to get a look as fresh as red lipstick used to give, we turn to shades that look more like ink."

Redefining Hawaiian Fine Dining,2016-08-09,article,News,,['Restaurants'],An ambitious new restaurant in Honolulu’s still pleasantly seedy Chinatown is serving small plates that re-envision the islands’ staples.,"For decades, Hawaii’s high-end restaurants have been dominated by outsiders.

Together the chefs, who met working at Per Se, have created a menu that centers on the islands’ most elemental staples, re-envisioned as haute cuisine. Red snapper, which in Hawaii is often served simply with ginger and soy sauce, is baked in a sourdough crust and cracked tableside; backyard fruits like mountain apples and guavas are prepared with traditional French techniques; and lowly starches like taro, sweet potatoes and breadfruit are given center stage. “This is not meant to be intellectual food,” Kajioka says. “We really want to represent Hawaii — just in a different way.”"

But Dupont argues that in no way does this prevent it from remaining relevant to contemporary audiences. “Classical dance is an extraordinarily precise and physical art form,” she says. “It’s like a Chanel handbag — it endures through the generations. The old steps of ‘Swan Lake’ can be danced in ways which make them new. Just like your grandmother’s Chanel can be worn with sneakers in order to keep it modern.”"

"A Luxury Liner at War, a Submarine in Peril",2016-08-18,article,News,,['Television'],The Smithsonian Channel’s day of nautical programming includes a look at the Queen Mary’s war years and the story of the U.S.S. Tang.,"The Queen Mary, put into service 80 years ago, was built as a passenger liner, but World War II altered its mission, a transformation explored in “Mighty Ship at War: The Queen Mary,” which airs Sunday, Aug. 21, as part of a daylong nautical theme on the Smithsonian Channel. As the situation in Europe darkened, the ship was increasingly used to ferry emigrants out of troubled areas, and once Britain declared war, it was turned into a troop transport. The program recounts a catastrophic incident in 1942 when the liner collided with one of its own escort ships, the Curacao, splitting it in half and killing more than 300. Sunday’s lineup also includes the final installment of “Hell Below,” a six-part series on submarine warfare in World War II. Part 6, “Fatal Voyage,” is about the U.S.S. Tang, which compiled a formidable record against Japanese ships until a fateful engagement in October 1944, when it was sunk by one of its own malfunctioning torpedoes."
