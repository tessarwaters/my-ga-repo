The Latest and Best in Crime Fiction,2016-11-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Michael Connelly continues to think up creative ways to keep his old war horse Harry Bosch on the job.,"Sooner or later, Harry Bosch will have to turn in his gun and retire from police work, but until that time Michael Connelly continues to think up creative ways to keep his old war horse on the job. In THE WRONG SIDE OF GOODBYE (Little, Brown, $29), Bosch is doing part-time volunteer work for the undermanned police force of San Fernando, an independent town completely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. “Look at me,” he remarks, “scratching and fighting to keep a badge on my belt at my age.” The work isn’t too taxing, but in going through several years’ worth of reports on sexual assaults, he notes a pattern common to four of these unsolved cases, which can only mean that a serial rapist is on the loose. And despite a bland sobriquet (“the Screen Cutter”) that makes him sound like the village handyman, this predator is likely to become ever more violent."

A huge manufacturing floor dominated by an overhead gantry that looks as if it could hoist a subway car, the place instead evokes distinctly unpoetic phrases like “productivity gains” and “customer fulfillment strategies.”"

This has long been a reason to applaud the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters program, a lifetime achievement award presented to a handful of artists every year since 1982. A concert at Flushing Town Hall on Friday, Nov. 18, will feature five such jazz masters: the pianist Barry Harris; the drummer Jimmy Cobb; the trumpeter Jimmy Owens; and the saxophonists George Coleman and Jimmy Heath.

They’ll perform in an all-star group with one younger outlier, the bassist David Wong. Not counting him, there will be well over 300 years of professional experience onstage.

Because for as much as Michael Crichton tried to suggest the dangers of technology and the hubris of resurrecting a world lost to history, his original “Westworld” was also a diverting piece of genre entertainment. Mr. Crichton always wanted to advance big, alarmist ideas — about viral plagues, about Japanese business tactics, about the true nature of sexual harassment — but his instinct for pleasing his audience is why he had a career as a best-selling author, rather than another penniless purveyor of hard sci-fi."

Itineraries Await in the Season’s Best Travel Books,2016-11-29,article,Review,,"['Travel and Vacations', 'Books and Literature']",New travel books include “The Timbuktu School for Nomads” and “The Humorless Ladies of Border Control.”,"Traveling can be complicated and nervous-making, yet for many of us the compulsion to be propelled across the map and renewed amid unfamiliar landscapes is irresistible. As Bill Bryson writes in his introduction to THE BEST AMERICAN TRAVEL WRITING 2016 (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $14.95), which highlights two dozen locations across the globe, travel is “enriching, stimulating, seductive, pleasurable — but very often a touch compulsive, too.” For an example of all these qualities, consult Gretel Ehrlich’s ravishing, troubling essay about her perilous journeys by dog sled on the melting ice floes off Greenland’s coast. (“When I asked if we were going to die, he smiled and said, ‘Imaqa.’ Maybe.”) Yet some travelers do seem to have reined in their wanderlust, alert to geopolitical flux. Five years ago, I learned the prudence of such caution when friends emailed me in alarm from Damascus, where they had been lured by an article I’d written about the city’s beguiling old-town souk — and had landed just as Syria’s civil war began. My apologies! But not everyone is deterred by warfare or global warming. A batch of new books bridges the gap between the timid and the intrepid wanderer, showing that with planning, a little luck and a modicum of attention to headlines, the world’s most arresting sights, tastes and wonders can still be yours — whether you conduct your journey in the 50 states, overseas, from the sanctuary of an armchair or from the bobbing back of a camel."

Matte stars deaden the light, their recesses best revealed in shadow. Creatures of chiaroscuro, they conquer and retreat, like Garbo, turn chameleonic in company, like Brando, alternating sullen disgruntlement with outright self-sabotage. Beards may be involved. Gloss stars, by contrast, eat up the light like a cat sunbathing on a windowsill. They strut with the room-temperature ease of toddlers showing off to their parents. Think of the peacock thrill of being looked at that John Travolta evinces in “Grease” or Tom Hanks in “Big” or Jennifer Lawrence in anything besides “The Hunger Games.” Theirs is an egoless egotism that, by dint of the generosity with which it is offered up, yields audiences the promise of transcended, liberated self.

Wrapping 4 Dances Into 1 at 100 Grand Street,2016-11-30,article,News,,['Dancing'],Bill Young celebrates the 30th anniversary of his dance space and the inaugural choreography.,"Thirty years ago, Bill Young inaugurated a new performance space at 100 Grand Street with a program of four dances bearing the overall title of “Interleaving.” To celebrate the anniversary of that space and event, he is recreating “Interleaving” with a new cast of 14 dancers for his unusual choreographic concept.

His subject is Shinjuku, the neighborhood around Tokyo’s major train station, historically not unlike Times Square: filled with bars and love hotels, rife with low-level crime and lurid advertising.
