Her eyes, emotional and direct, are staring through a geometric pattern that recalls a midcentury breeze-block fence of the kind found in his native Jamaica. Smith, 31, made the barrier by picking for hours at the image with a retrofitted wooden needle tool that he often uses to puncture the surface of his pictures, a technique which evokes both the coming-of-age ritual of scarification once common in West Africa and the luminous pointillism of Georges Seurat. “It sometimes takes a week for me to finish one,” Smith says of his images, as he walks toward the sole window in the work space, located on the fourth floor of an unassuming former factory in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Smith has rented the smallish boxlike space since he moved to New York in 2014 from Kansas City, Missouri, where he studied ceramics at the Kansas City Art Institute.

How to Laugh at Yourself,2019-04-09,article,News,,"['Laughter', 'Comedy and Humor']","Make a list of things you don’t like about yourself. Crack jokes about the less-painful stuff first.

How easily you can do so will depend in part on your disposition. If you tend to be dour, you can learn to be funnier with practice. (Or don’t — and risk developing what one humor scientist has termed “terminal seriousness.”) In one of Hofmann’s studies, subjects underwent two months of a well-known seven-step humor training program. Laughing at yourself was the penultimate step (what Hofmann calls “Olympic level” humor). Before trying it, first figure out what you think is funny and surround yourself with more of it. When it’s time to laugh at yourself, be prepared for an unpleasant task: You need to list the things you don’t like about yourself — maybe you’re insecure about your body or dislike your lisp. Arrange the list from least sensitive to most, then read it to someone before you start cracking jokes (researchers believe this vulnerability exercise greases the wheels for future levity). Next, come up with a few self-referential jokes about the less weighty stuff and eventually work your way up to the more painful things. “Strategically desensitize yourself,” Hofmann says."

There’s Susan Choi’s novel “Trust Exercise,” about classmates at a performing arts high school. Miriam Toews’s novel “Women Talking,” about Mennonite victims of sexual violence. Nell Freudenberger’s novel “Lost and Wanted,” which views a remembered friendship through the lens of science. In “Women’s Work,” Megan K. Stack turns the microscope on herself, and her class privilege, to explore her relationship to the women she hired as domestic help when she lived overseas. There’s also Leo Damrosch’s great group biography of the Club — the 18th-century British intellectuals who met weekly for food, drink and conversation that nurtured their creative genius. (They saved it for more exciting things than their club’s name.) Finally, Clive Thompson examines the culture of Silicon Valley coders and Pitchaya Sudbanthad traces several generations of Thai characters in his debut novel, “Bangkok Wakes to Rain.” Read it, or any of this week’s titles, with a book group."

Martin — and that Ireland and Britain technically did, though their borders persisted in a state of ontological flux.

How to Be a Nose Breather,2019-04-23,article,News,,['Nose'],You might want to consider taping your mouth shut at night.,"‘‘Start by being cognizant of your breathing patterns during the day,” says Nicholas Michalak, chief executive at Somnifix, a company that sells adhesive strips for people who want to tape their mouths shut at night to enforce nose breathing. Set alarms on your phone throughout the day to check in and remind yourself to use your nostrils. Humans naturally do most of their breathing through their nasal passages, which serve to heat, humidify and filter the air. It’s not uncommon, though, to slip into a mouth-breathing habit. Test yourself by inhaling through your nostrils. If you can’t, you may have some kind of obstruction, and should go see an ear, nose and throat specialist. If you can but tend not to, you may be an accidental mouth breather."

The Agony of Walter Benjamin,2019-04-26,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"The artist Frédéric Pajak’s hybrid book “Uncertain Manifesto” is haunted by the philosopher’s encounters with fascism, among much else, as these illustrated panels show.","“Uncertain Manifesto,” a recently translated book from the Swiss-French writer and artist Frédéric Pajak, is a hybrid, both in form and function. His black-and-white sketches illustrate a collection of stray thoughts — “snippets of adventure, random memories, maxims, ghosts, forgotten heroes, trees, the raging sea,” as he explains in his preface.

In Pajak’s drawings, Benjamin experiences the maddened crowds, exiles himself to Ibiza and then Paris, and eventually commits suicide during a failed escape from the Continent. In an email, Pajak explained his fascination with the philosopher: “The past has two faces: the past of the victors and the past of the vanquished, erased from history. But, history can only exist if the present repairs the trauma of the past. The injustice done to the victims of history must be repaired, even and especially if, as Benjamin wrote, ‘it is more difficult to honor the memory of the nameless than that of the known.’”"

Tall, expensive buildings are rising around 10th Avenue, and gallery rents are rising along with them. Young art dealers arrive to try their hand in the official gallery neighborhood, and often fold-up shop quickly, as the promisingly offbeat American Medium, which started in Brooklyn, did recently. The juggernaut of mega-gallery showrooms continues, with behemoths like Hauser & Wirth mounting impressive historical shows (and starting their own bookstores, publishing houses, magazines and nonprofit foundations), and David Zwirner is planning a Renzo Piano-designed space to open in 2020. Meanwhile, the High Line looms ubiquitously overhead, like a people mover transporting tourists (mostly) from the new Hudson Yards on the north end to the gleaming Whitney Museum of American Art on the south. Contemporary art is everywhere though, including the High Line, where you’ll find a monumental sculpture by Simone Leigh, who just opened a show at the Guggenheim, along with other notable displays.

This gives the art scene in this neighborhood and the ones developing around it — in NoHo, East Village South, Chinatown or Little Italy — a certain lightness of being. We’re often looking at first, not necessarily mature or final, artistic statements. It helps that the area lacks the dwarfing juggernaut of big-name, property-proud galleries and blue-chip artists that give Chelsea or the Upper East Side their weight.

He could have been describing the geography of New York City galleries. In the 1970s, the climates were macro and few (the Upper East Side, SoHo). In the 1980s, they were joined by the East Village; in the 1990s, by Chelsea; and in the 2000s, by the Lower East Side and Brooklyn. And there are spillovers everywhere. Today, it can be hard to tag a gallery by district, as I learned when visiting a handful that straddle either side of Canal Street, a cross-island axis that runs from SoHo to Chinatown, without claiming full allegiance to either.
