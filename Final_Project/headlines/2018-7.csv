Tom Wolfe’s Lesser Known Career as a Cartoonist,2018-07-06,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Cartoons and Cartoonists']","Taking the absurdist themes and trends of his 1970s milieu as his material, the late New Journalist left behind visual reminders of his endless capacity for satire.","Tom Wolfe, who died on May 14, had a lesser-known but not-so-secret passion: He loved to draw caricatures and cartoons with the same incisive, sarcastic wit that came through in his written social commentary. His pictures were inspired by the turn-of-the-century German Jugendstil (“youth style,” or Art Nouveau), graphic artist provocateurs who regularly outraged both bourgeois and aristocratic Junker classes by poking holes in their masks and debunking their pretensions in the notorious weekly satirical journal Simplicissimus (also known as Der Simpl in the 1940s). He also owed a debt to his favorite visual trickster, Ronald Searle, whom Wolfe praised as a “giant of the graphic netherworld” on the front page of a 1981 Times Book Review. Wolfe surprisingly identified as much as a cartoonist as he did a writer, and many of his drawings were captioned. In 1979, the same year that “The Right Stuff” was published, he wrote the introduction to an exhibition catalog I edited on Simplicissimus. “Caricaturists, as any caricaturist can tell you,” he wrote, “live, work and die in a shantytown scarcely visible from that monumental Brasília known as the world of art.” He was referring to his own inclination for the comic art form, which he started practicing in 1956 at The Springfield Union (the predecessor of The Republican) in Massachusetts. He continued: “The few miserable souls in the fine art classes who are interested in caricature pass around pictures by the artists they admire, quietly, by hand, as if in some Novosibirsk samizdat network.” He likened his first introduction to the work of the master graphistes from Der Simpl, at the Union in 1959, to having discovered another planet “where, as in science fiction novels, the creatures were more enlightened than those on earth.” In 1980, Wolfe emerged from his self-imposed netherworld with “In Our Time,” his book of mocking sketches and stinging essays about the 1970s’ absurd fashions, trendy morals and silly conceits. The drawings from that book reprinted here pay overt homage to the style of the period, but even more to the audacity of its artists to subversively — often savagely — lampoon their targets while still leaving them laughing and wanting more."

In early October, the dining facilities at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a neo-Classical landmark built in 1928, will be the first component of the Frank Gehry-led redesign of the museum’s interior to open to the public. Mr. Gehry was selected for the renovation in 2006, but the wheels for the master plan didn’t start turning until 2010. (The whole project will be completed by 2020.) A 76-seat restaurant called Stir, to be run by Starr Catering, which came up with the restaurant’s name, will be warmly wood-paneled in Douglas fir, with a ceiling that undulates, Gehry-style. Central to the ceiling is a gridlike sculpture of curved crisscrossed slats and beams.  Mr. Gehry’s contribution to the restaurant includes the tables and chairs, but not the tableware. The chef Mark Tropea, a former chef for residents of 15 Central Park West, an apartment tower in New York, will preside over the open kitchen. He plans to offer seasonal fare with strong local connections, like Kennett Square mushrooms, Barnegat scallops and a burger topped with Lancaster Cheddar. A new, enlarged cafeteria, also run by Starr Catering, is part of the plan. The dining options do not have an outside entrance, so museum admission is required for entry. “We envision it as part of a total museum experience,” Gail Harrity, the museum’s chief operating officer, wrote in an email.  Stir will open only during museum hours, so just lunch and brunch will be served; the cafeteria will be open from morning until late afternoon."

"Inside J.R.R. Tolkien’s Notebooks, a Glimpse of the Master Philologist at Work",2018-07-13,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Language and Languages']",A manuscript page from the “Lord of the Rings” author’s notebooks reveals his painstaking process of language invention.,"From Qenya to Gnomish to Sindarin, the “high elven-speech” J. R. R. Tolkien uses amply throughout the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy was the product of almost 40 years of what the English author once referred to as his “secret vice”: glossopoeia, or language creation. As Carl F. Hostetter writes in an essay in Catherine McIlwaine’s “Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth,” his was a labor “performed and preserved on thousands of manuscript pages containing Tolkien’s minutely detailed description and unceasing elaboration (and revision) of not just one but rather of a family of invented languages, which can be collectively called the Elvish tongues.” Although not alone in this practice, Tolkien was the first philologist to establish such a network of evolving dialects that derive from one another “by slowly accumulating changes and divergences in form across time from a common ancestor species.” Tolkien drew this partial table of sound-correspondences among five Elvish languages — Qenya, Telerin, Noldorin, Ilkorin and Danian — around 1940. The meticulous organization scheme together with the curved lines connecting lexical groupings reveal both the “systematic phonetic” and the “historical” relationships between these individual tongues, while the numerous self-correction marks reflect a literary mind almost obsessed with perfecting each and every one of them, “in both comprehensive tabulation and in minute detail.”"

Making a documentary film requires that you find people who are having an interesting or harrowing or profound experience and follow them as it unfolds. Of course, the divide isn’t as absolute as that; books can chronicle real-time experiences and films often include talking heads holding forth about the past. Still, the difference is striking. Books require that people recount their emotions; documentaries require that people bare the same emotions in front of a film crew.

Room With Quite a View: Danny Meyer’s Manhatta ,2018-07-17,article,News,,"['Restaurants', 'Bars and Nightclubs']","Lower Manhattan gets this eye-popping aerie, a new Cipriani venture, and more restaurant news. ","Simply entering the building to dine at Manhatta, the new downtown restaurant from Danny Meyer and his Union Square Hospitality Group (in partnership with Fosun International, a Chinese company), suggests that this will be no ordinary experience. Manhatta has its own street entrance and a plush lobby leading to dedicated elevators. Up you go to the 60th floor, the entirety of which is given over to the restaurant and the Bay Room, a spacious private event space (Mr. Meyer’s first) that abuts it. It’s worth going at least for a drink at the commanding 40-foot black walnut bar, which, like the restaurant, has sweeping views of the city and New Jersey. (There’s no back bar lined with bottles, lest they interfere. And the décor is suitably understated, with dark wood furnishings and bronze accents that would suit a tavern.) If you tire of the panorama, there’s a gleaming open kitchen, with Jason Pfeifer, the executive chef, and his team at work. Though Mr. Pfeifer was last seen in the kitchen Maialino, here he looks more to France than to Italy. The well-tailored informality and emphasis on seasonality have much in common with Mr. Meyer’s flagship Union Square Cafe. “At Manhatta, there’s less emphasis on California and the Mediterranean,” Mr. Pfeifer said. The evening menu offers peekytoe crab salad with leeks and artichokes, a French onion burger, duck tortellini in consommé and classic veal blanquette. Lunch is coming soon. Chocolate mousse, a vanilla soufflé and blackberries with walnut gelato and sabayon cater to the sweet tooth. "

If it weren’t for the salon’s half dozen Japanese-made brown-leather barber chairs, the brick-walled industrial space could easily be mistaken for an art gallery or one of the area’s many design shops — and that’s the point. “We created a space that takes into consideration the whole experience of a haircut,” says Pearson. This includes a rotating display of paintings by local artists as well as an eclectic playlist of music — everything from The Brian Jonestown Massacre to Frank Ocean — to complement the understated quality cuts."

As a testament to the designers’ laid-back Hawaiian sensibility, the brand offers board shorts — a classic surfer’s style of swimsuit — only in understated colorways and in trimmer, more tailored fits. “One of our biggest inspirations is surf history here in Hawaii,” Serrao says. “We’re recreating those original board shorts that were made of durable materials and made to last.” What’s more, having the drawstring hidden within the waistband lends the trunks a clean silhouette.

Ample Hills Opens Its Red Hook Factory,2018-07-31,article,News,,"['Restaurants', 'Pizza']","Lombardi’s unveils a lavish Chelsea location, a rooftop bar named after a well-connected interior designer and other restaurant news.","Delays in opening a restaurant are common in New York. And the roadblocks are compounded when a place to eat also involves a fully equipped ice cream factory and bakery, as in the case of Ample Hills Creamery Factory and Museum. The location was one of the complications that pushed the opening back the best part of a year. Brian Smith and Jackie Cuscuna, the owners, who founded the company in Prospect Heights seven years ago, were dealing with raw space. “We had to build the infrastructure from scratch,” Mr. Smith said. They also had to switch architects midstream. The new 15,000-square-foot facility, with a scoop shop and counters in front and behind it, a playroom and an interactive museum of ice cream, is built into Beard Street Warehouses. Part of a series of brick storerooms from the mid-19th century, the warehouses were once used to hold goods like cotton and coffee. The space has allowed Ample Hills to improve production with the capacity to churn out 500,000 gallons a year (right now they’re at 50,000). In place of batch freezers, there is now a continuous system. Mix-ins like cookie pieces made in the bakery are added automatically and pints are filled by machine, not by hand. Mr. Smith said that, if anything, this industrialization should enhance the ice cream’s texture. And though the company is now able to deliver pints to many more retail shops, Mr. Smith said they would keep opening scoop shops, adding, “We don’t just want to be pints in grocery stores.” Los Angeles will have an Ample Hills in the fall, followed by another one on Prospect Park West, to bring the total to 13."
