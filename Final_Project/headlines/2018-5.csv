This illustrated book, intended for children but informative for all, reminds us of Massimo Vignelli’s great innovation. THE WORLD-ENDING FIRE By Wendell Berry. (Counterpoint, $26.)

Celebrate Spring With an Upscale Smothered-Chicken Dinner,2018-05-01,article,News,,[],"A Madeira-laced cream sauce with the fresh, crisp softness of chicken tastes like magic.","Chefs are not generally the best source for recipes. They don’t use them the way we do at home. Often they don’t use recipes at all. Many of them cook instinctively, the way artists work. They do not measure ingredients before cooking. They navigate by taste and smell. They respond to the sound of fat sizzling against a piece of fish, or the sight of a shallot turning golden in the heat. When they’re happy with the food, they jot down a few notes, then cook the dish again and again until it can be made by rote. The people who work for them watch and listen and smell and taste until they can do the same — professional cooking is about apprenticeship and technique. Most line cooks don’t receive formal recipes from which to cook. They get battlefield instruction for soldiers new to the front, sauce-stained cards scribbled with notes: sweat in rondeau, drop; roast, save fond; arroser fish; crash jus with stock. Civilians don’t cook that way."

Bans on Plastic Straws Are Growing.

But cruise lines and luxury resorts are lagging. ,"The United States goes through over 500 million plastic straws every day, according to Eco-Cycle, a United States-based nonprofit recycling organization. They get used for only a few minutes, but potentially last for hundreds of years in the ocean, and are among the top 10 pollutants collected during beach cleanups. Plastic straws kill marine life and choke reefs and beaches, never decomposing completely, but instead breaking into bits of microplastics, which eventually enter the food chain.

That faulty valve had been replaced several years ago but wasn’t working properly and was leaking again. To fix the valve, the cardiac surgeon intended to remove the old tissue, resecting the ring-shaped wall of the aorta around it. He would then build a new vessel wall, crafted from the heart-lining of a cow, and stitch a new valve into that freshly built ring of aorta. It was the most exquisite form of human tailoring that I had ever seen."

How Exercise Can Help You Recall Words,2018-05-15,article,News,,"['Exercise', 'Psychology and Psychologists', 'Memory', 'Age, Chronological', 'Language and Languages', 'Elderly']",Aerobic fitness may help you avoid lapses in your vocabulary.,"Call them tip-of-the-tongue moments: those times we can’t quite call up the name or word that we know we know. These frustrating lapses are thought to be caused by a brief disruption in the brain’s ability to access a word’s sounds. We haven’t forgotten the word, and we know its meaning, but its formulation dances teasingly just beyond our grasp. Though these mental glitches are common throughout life, they become more frequent with age. Whether this is an inevitable part of growing older or somehow lifestyle-dependent is unknown. But because evidence already shows that physically fit older people have reduced risks for a variety of cognitive deficits, researchers recently looked into the relationship between aerobic fitness and word recall.

When 250,000 people gathered for the 1963 March on Washington, or nearly a million showed up for the 1982 anti-nukes rally in Central Park, it symbolized a certain power and legitimacy, a collective coming-of-age. A major protest presented a huge organizational challenge, and pulling one off delivered a potent message: Here was a force to be reckoned with. ¶ Today, the mass protest is often seen as a beginning, not an end — a moment of “bursting onto the scene, but only the first stage in a potentially long journey,” as the sociologist Zeynep Tufekci writes in her 2017 book, “Twitter and Tear Gas.” Getting people onto the streets remains difficult and time-consuming, but in the era of social media, it’s far easier than it once was. Now the real challenge comes after the grand event: Will the passion of the crowd translate into a “movement” capable of being sustained over the long term? ¶ That’s the question being asked of the many and varied protest efforts that have sprung up in recent months. “The Parkland Teens Started Something,” a Washington Post headline noted in mid-April. “How Can"

The Secret Atelier Behind a Roman Boutique,2018-05-16,article,News,,['Design'],The owners of the Roman design boutique Chez Dédé create a private space where creativity can run wild.,"Rome is a city of pockets and alcoves. Strolling its streets, you catch glimpses of intimate spaces that exist just beyond the public facades: wisteria-draped courtyards, ivy-shrouded archways, begonias spilling from terraces. These hints of private realms beckon most alluringly from the Tiber River-adjacent Regola neighborhood, known since the Renaissance as the center for mercantile activities from plate-making to leather-stitching. It’s here, in a space in the historic Palazzo Capponi Antonelli, a 16th-century building with a pebbled cortile and a stone fountain, that the boutique Chez Dédé sells the best of contemporary Italian artisanry. In the ground-floor boutique, whose walls are hung with posters drawn by co-owner Andrea Ferolla, a 56-year-old fashion illustrator and creative director, items are arranged in inviting tableaus — a retail version of the ideal Roman home. The brand’s own patterned canvas carryalls sit atop velvet-upholstered couches, and the living room’s lampshades are sewn from vintage Arjumand’s World wallpaper; the vanity’s shelves are lined with Linda Rodin’s perfume; and beyond that, there is a closet dedicated to robes, dresses and coats by the Italian line Giuliva Heritage Collection. “I wanted to show how objects could inform each other,” says co-owner Daria Reina, a 48-year-old photographer and creative director who, with Ferolla, opened the shop three years ago. (Like many respectable creative duos, the two had a scandalous affair before becoming a couple 16 years ago, back when Reina was freelancing at an agency where Ferolla was a creative director.)"

8 New Books We Recommend This Week,2018-05-24,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"In a sense, all books are black box flight data recorders: They put us at the scene and grant us access to conversations and events we couldn’t otherwise witness, even when the flights in question are only (or “only”) flights of fancy. But the metaphor is especially apt for this week’s list of recommended titles, which includes Rachel Slade’s “Into the Raging Sea” — a true-life disaster tale that’s heavily informed by the actual black box recovered from the wreck of the cargo ship El Faro. Other books this week drop us into the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide (“The Girl Who Smiled Beads”), unexpected motherhood (“And Now We Have Everything”) and Eleanor Roosevelt’s relationship with the reporter Lorena Hickok (“White Houses”). And since books, unlike black boxes, can also show us what people are thinking, we have two books puzzling out the fate of democracies, one taking on the modern world’s biggest ideas, and a posthumous collection of psychologically astute stories from a master of the form, William Trevor. As with El Faro, the best thing about black boxes is their ability to resurrect the dead."

As the title suggests, Masini’s new collection often engages with movies as a theme — “this burden of being watcher and screen” — but its darker, more intimate poems involve a sick sister. RADICAL LOVE Translated and edited by Omid Safi. (Yale University, $25.) Teachings from the Islamic mystical tradition celebrate God, community, romantic love and more, in verse."

10 New Books We Recommend This Week,2018-05-31,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Americans love to eat foreign food, and hate to read foreign books. That’s the perception in publishing circles, anyway, and if there are obvious exceptions — I’m looking at you, Paulo Coelho — it’s still the case that even adventurous readers in this country aren’t always sure where to start once they reach the border. We’re here to help. Three of this week’s recommended titles are European novels: “Mirror, Shoulder, Signal,” by the Danish writer Dorthe Nors, “All for Nothing,” by the German writer Walter Kempowski, and “Kudos,” the conclusion of an exceptional trilogy by the British writer Rachel Cusk. Staying in the realm of foreign affairs, you might pick up Ronan Farrow’s “War on Peace,” about the decline of the United States diplomatic corps. And for people in this country or elsewhere who prefer to read about America and its ways, we have books (fiction and non) about Appalachia and Southern California, capitalism, criminal justice and more."
