Serious people want balanced budgets and price stability, never mind what the textbooks say.

A debt cliff at 90 percent! — while radicals like me are the ones citing Econ 101."

Liar’s Luck,2014-04-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A crooked lawyer on the run plays the tables in Macau and Hong Kong.,"Damn. Another writer I have to care about. After a certain age, it’s as irksome to add to the list of writers one reads as it is to add to one’s circle of friends. For most of his career, Lawrence Osborne gave the impression of being someone I could safely ignore. He wrote a novel in his youth that went the way of most first novels before carving out a career as a travel writer and wine connoisseur, but then in his 50s something jolted him into writing another novel, “The Forgiven,” about Westerners partying on the edge of the North African desert, which turned out to be dark, brilliant and about as ­ignorable as a ­switchblade.

Suddenly That Summer,2014-04-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Linn Ullmann’s family novel is set in motion by a nanny’s murder.,"Although a vicious crime serves as the grain of sand around which this pearl of a novel is formed, Linn Ullmann’s “The Cold Song” is not a crime story. Little concerned with villain, motives or detection of evidence, it doesn’t aim for a solution, for redemption or justice. And with a first chapter that begins, “Milla, or what was left of her, was found by Simen and two of his friends when they were digging for buried treasure in the woods,” it hardly seeks to maintain suspense about the identity or fate of the victim. Yet the novel — Ullmann’s fifth, translated from Norwegian by Barbara J. Haveland — is steeped in dread the way a fruitcake is steeped in rum: ­Every page, every line, seems to glisten with vapors of sumptuous, intoxicating unease."

Inside the List,2014-04-04,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"In “Thrive,” which is No. 1 on the hardcover nonfiction list, Arianna Huffington offers a technocratic version of the old work-life equation, swathed in New Age incense.","Triple Threat: It’s tempting to be cynical, I know, when you come across another book by a rich and powerful person avowing that power and riches are, like, totally overrated and happiness is all that matters. And when that rich and powerful person is Arianna Huffington — whose media empire, The Huffington Post, is famous among other things for encouraging writers to work without pay — well, cynicism becomes downright unavoidable. (At least her message is consistent: Why pay contributors if money corrupts?) Huffington’s new book, “Thrive,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1, arguing that our obsession with wealth and status obscures the importance of mental well-being as the “third metric” of success. Basically, it’s a technocratic version of the old work-life equation, swathed in New Age incense: “Our breath,” Huffington declares early on, “also has a sacredness about it.” None of this means the book doesn’t make good points along the way, advising readers to sleep longer, take more walks and disengage every now and then from the digital world — including, presumably, from The Huffington Post. When Huffington appeared on “The Daily Show” recently, Jon Stewart seemed unsure what to make of her new persona. “I swear,” he said, “you’re like William Randolph Hearst and Martha Stewart and Oprah, all rolled together now. And I don’t know what the hell is going on.”"

Consider Harriet the Spy, who made sense of the world in her green composition notebook long before journals earned their own verb; or Matilda Wormwood, who sailed away from the sinking ship of her family on a life raft made of stories.

Taking the Helm,2014-04-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A 13-year-old boy growing up on Narragansett Bay tries to save his family in this young adult novel.,"“Swim That Rock,” an affable coming-of-age novel by Jay Primiano and John Rocco, is bookended by pencil drawings ostensibly made by Jake Cole, the book’s 14-year-old narrator. The opening spread (in fact drawn by Rocco, a noted children’s book illustrator) features maps of the story’s setting — Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay and Upper Bay Tributaries. Their style and annotations call to mind Christopher Robin’s whimsical map inside the front cover of A. A. Milne’s “Winnie-the-Pooh.” In place of the “100 Aker Wood,” Jake gives us “100 Acre Cove”; instead of “Where the ­Woozle Wasn’t,” he marks the spot where he “caught 17 stripers with Captain.”"

Stories of Resistance and Escape,2014-04-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Three books look at the experiences of Jews in hiding during the Holocaust, and at the people who sheltered them.","My Jewish great-grandparents made the fortunate decision to leave Europe in the first decade of the 20th century, so my closest personal connection to the Holocaust was through my high school French teacher, Annette Berman. Annette was a 15-year-old Jewish schoolgirl living in Paris when World War II began. As restrictions and fear mounted during the German occupation, she and her family hid for weeks in her best friend’s apartment; then, using borrowed identity cards, they traveled to a remote village where Annette spent the next two years disguised as a Roman Catholic, delivering messages and explosives for the French Resistance on her bicycle. Reading the heart-­stopping journeys of the child survivors in “Hidden,” “Hidden Like Anne Frank” and “The Whispering Town” drove home to me that Annette’s incredible story is far from unique."

Sticky Fingers,2014-04-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Donna Leon’s “By Its Cover” appears to have been inspired by a systematic sacking of thousands of rare books that came to light in 2012.,"Whenever some fresh instance of blatant corruption or rank depravity comes to light in Italy (toxic waste in agricultural Campania, political scandal in Lombardia, a proposal to build an ugly skyscraper in Mestre), Commissario Guido Brunetti, the principled protagonist of Donna Leon’s uplifting Venetian mysteries, looks to his family and to the wise philosophers of ancient Rome to restore his faith in humanity. Leon tends to console herself by writing a new book. BY ITS COVER (Atlantic Monthly, $26), which finds the author in a fury over vandalism and theft in national libraries, museums and churches, appears to have been inspired by the looting of Naples’s Girolamini Library by its director, a systematic sacking of thousands of rare books that came to light in 2012. (“It would make a stone weep,” according to one of Brunetti’s colleagues.) Although the criminal damage done at the venerable Biblioteca Merula is on a far more modest scale, it’s no less heartbreaking to the library director, as well as to the commissario. It’s also a great mystery. How was the damage done when the only patrons of this obscure library are innocuous scholars like Joseph Nickerson, an American academic researching maritime and Mediterranean trade history, and an ex-priest affectionately known as Tertullian for his obsessive study of the writings of the Church Fathers? The melancholy tone of the storytelling suits the narrative, especially when the ex-priest is found savagely murdered."
The Devil’s Woods,2014-04-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this debut novel, a teenager contemplates ridding a logging town of a brute.","It’s tempting to say that “A Man Came Out of a Door in the Mountain,” the first novel by Adrianne Harun, is set in a “dead-end town” — indeed the book’s publicity copy employs the phrase. It’s useful shorthand, invoking a familiar image. The trouble with it is the fact that Harun, the author of a story collection, “The King of Limbo,” is not one bit interested in the familiar. Her nameless British Columbia logging outpost makes the dead-end town look benign and cozy, a cousin of the cul-de-sac. "
Never Hurts to Ask,2014-04-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Essays on pain, both physical and emotional, and how it affects our relationships with one another and with ourselves.","Regarding the pain of others requires more than just a pair of eyes. It necessitates an act of the imagination: a willingness to think or feel oneself into the interior of another’s experience, to cross between what Susan Sontag once designated as the kingdoms of the sick and of the well. This kind of empathetic border crossing can be both difficult and dangerous, the sort of journey of which one might say: “I get across quickly because I’m headed in the right direction, by which I mean the wrong direction. I’m going where no one wants to stay.”"

Meeting a stranger, you may walk past without interest or, intrigued by a glimpse of color or movement, strive to see more and deeper, beyond the mannerly surface. Unlike those riskier “rear window” views, streetfront views shed light primarily on the most predictable of daytime activities. Peer long enough, however, and you might witness something more private. "

Who Made That Black Box?,2014-04-04,article,News,,"['AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES', 'Inventions and Patents', 'Pilots']",And let’s get one thing clear: It is actually orange.,"Let’s get one thing clear: The “black box” isn’t black. It’s orange. Before airlines made that color standard for their flight recorders, some Boeings used a yellow sphere, and the British had a gizmo called the Red Egg. So why do they call it “black”? One explanation goes this way: In 1939, an aviation engineer named François Hussenot devised a means of capturing an aircraft’s history to a box of photographic film. Onboard sensors flashed into the box through calibrated mirrors and traced a running tab of flight parameters, including altitude, air speed and the position of the cockpit controls. Because the device worked like a camera, its insides had to be in total darkness; thus, perhaps, the “black""-ness of the box."

In March of 1961, less than a year after his graduation from Harvard, this 22-year-old heir to the Rockefeller fortune flew to Dutch New Guinea to work on a documentary film and to collect artifacts for the Museum of Primitive Art, a Manhattan institution endowed by his father, New York’s governor, Nelson Rockefeller. That November, the young man’s catamaran capsized off the southwest coast of the Asmat tribal area. After a monthlong search, he was declared lost at sea, probably drowned.

What’s more, the California chef and teacher John Ash, demonstrating a recipe at the recent “Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives” conference at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley – an event that bridges health care, nutrition science and cooking – insists that not only does asparagus taste better when it’s not cooked in or near water, but also that it doesn’t cause that distinctive odor in urine many people experience after eating it.

But while Pettibon examines the trappings of surf culture in the paintings, the artist — who despite living in Venice Beach, Calif., has never ridden the waves himself — is also dealing with universal truths. These works are about the solitary surfer against the vast ocean, man against nature. “You get a sense that nature is going to swallow him up,” Lindemann notes. “You could see them as disaster paintings.”"

A sac called the “Ninja Pouch” flips and flops into multiple configurations; rectangular bags have dual handles that allow for horizontal or vertical orientation; softly structured “box” bags function as either.

Three’s a Trend | Concrete Sculpture at the SP-Arte fair in São Paulo,2014-04-08,article,News,,"['Art', 'Sculpture']",A number of hometown galleries trotted out work that reveled in its raw minimalism.,"Last week, São Paulo played host to the 10th annual SP-Arte fair, held in the gargantuan Ciccillo Matarazzo pavilion in Ibirapuera Park, a sinuous structure of concrete, steel and glass designed by Oscar Niemeyer for the 1957 São Paulo Biennial. Perhaps the setting explains the preponderance of minimalist concrete sculpture trotted out by several hometown galleries at this year’s event, which closed on Sunday. At Galeria Jaqueline Martins, São Paulo-based Ana Mazzei’s “Et Nous, Nous Marchons Inconnus” (which translates to “And We, We Walk Unknown”) was a procession of gray geometric forms marching from wall to floor. David Batchelor, a Scotsman, placed a number of cement bricks on plinths at the booth of Galeria Leme, adorning them with shards of broken, colored glass. Meanwhile, at the upstart gallery Emma Thomas, a buffet of drinking glasses (water, Margarita, shot, Champagne) were spread across a table and filled to the brim with cement by the local artist Lucas Simões. Called “Bebado Samba” (or “Drunken Samba”), it’s a punning rejoinder to Brazil’s midcentury “Concrete” and “Neo-Concrete” art movements, which spiraled off into a plurality of aesthetics and “a scene impossible to read as a single movement,” according to the artist. “ The final view can be seen as a party where the drunken conversations happen.”"

Occupying one half of the gallery Project B, the furniture designer Max Lamb has lined an entire room — furniture included — in his new twist on terrazzo, the speckled composite material which will remind many Americans of airport flooring, but which for Lamb served as a reference to classic Italian vestibules. While the pattern is currently trending in design and fashion (see Carven’s recent terrazzo-print sweatshirts), Lamb says he’s been experimenting with it since 2011, after his frequent work with stone led him to visit an old-school terrazzo maker in Yorkshire, near where he grew up. He then “went a completely different route,” he says. His version — the first product in a new line of designer architectural surfaces called Dzek, launched by the former Phillips de Pury retail director Brent Dzekciorius — embeds chunks of marble in resin instead of cement, making the material much more durable. And unlike the terrazzo of yore, which was usually poured on-site, it’s pre-cast and sold by the square foot. “It has endless applications,” he says. “It can be used on walls, floors, ceilings. You can even C.N.C.-mill a bathtub out of it.”"

How did Park Service employees respond to the series? Guardedly at first, to judge from a 1995 profile in National Parks magazine that cited Barr’s perceived “disregard for both the agency and the people” who worked in the parks. “I enjoy the stories,” one employee acknowledged, “but some of the cynicism about the Park Service makes me feel like I’m at work.” Things have gotten better since then: In 2011, the National Parks Conservation Association presented Barr with an award for “enhancing public understanding of national parks” and drawing “attention to the invaluable work of National Park Service staff.” The 18th Anna Pigeon mystery, “Destroyer Angel,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 8."

But decency in the conventional sense is not his concern, though in another sense it very much is. When you wipe away the blood and the anarchic humor, what you see in ‘Django Unchained’ is moral disgust with slavery, instinctive sympathy for the underdog and an affirmation (in the relationship between Django and Schultz) of what used to be called brotherhood.”"

I sat with Iliana at the lunch and asked her about the salad. “Just salt the cabbage, let it sit for a while, then add lots of lemon juice and the mashed avocado,” she said.

Roasting the tomatillos, chiles and garlic – toasting really, as I use a skillet for this, on top of the flame – produces a salsa with a delicious charred flavor. I learned something recently from the chef Iliana de la Vega, who demonstrated the recipe at the “Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives” conference in Napa Valley in March: she says, in no uncertain terms, that you should not add water to tomatillo salsas. Without the water, this is a more intense salsa with pleasing density. You can use it as a sauce to serve with chicken or fish, or as a dip with chips or other vegetables."

The insect, famed for its remarkable annual migrations, faced declines in habitat on both the Mexican and American ends of its range for decades, but now is the focus of an urgent push for a rescue.

The letter (read it here) describes policies the administration could pursue on both public and private land along the butterfly’s migratory path.  In February, after about 20 naturalists, poets and other monarch defenders pressed for international action in an open letter, the plight of the butterfly was addressed by President Obama and his Mexican and Canadian counterparts at a summit. The leaders agreed to create a working group to study ways to protect the butterfly at both ends of its range. A recent article by Richard Conniff in Yale Environment 360 describes what farmers can do to help monarchs.

"Mexico: Homicides Decline Near Border, Report Says",2014-04-15,article,Brief,,['Murders and Attempted Murders'],"Murders in Mexico declined in 2013, and they decreased significantly in several cities near the border with the United States, according to a new report."," Murders in Mexico declined in 2013, and they decreased significantly in several cities near the border with the United States, according to a new report from the Justice in Mexico Project at the University of San Diego to be released Tuesday. Using preliminary police data, researchers identified a homicide decrease of about 16 percent, with some of the biggest drops in murders in Ciudad Juárez and Monterrey, notoriously dangerous cities that have recently calmed down as the war between criminal gangs and the government has declined in intensity. Still, experts warn, it is not clear whether the decline is attributable to an overall weakening of organized crime: The number of gun-related murders has held steady as other kinds of killing have declined, and homicides have sharply risen in states farther south. Extortion and kidnapping have also increased nationwide. But with overall murder rates down for the second year in a row from their 2011 peak, some parts of Mexico appear to be on the mend, said David A. Shirk, an author of the report. “The decrease in violence that the government in Mexico is trying to convince people of is in fact real,” he said. "

Reading them, it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future, because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success. At times, as when he writes that Obamacare “has won its survival” and allows that that “there are still many good critiques to make” of the law, he seems to be using a narrow definition, with which I mostly agree — the law won’t collapse under its own weight, the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely, etc. But when he uses language like “the individual mandate … is working” and “the law is back on its expected track,” and concludes that “[Kathleen Sebelius] can leave with the law she helped build looking, shockingly, like a success,” it implies a stronger definition of victory, in which Obamacare isn’t just continuing, isn’t just unlikely to be swiftly repealed, but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would."

What’s On Thursday,2014-04-17,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Fuse) PIRATE RADIO (2009) The time: Britain in the mid-1960s, when the BBC, aided by the government, kept official radio channels mostly free of rock ’n’ roll. The place: a tanker off the British coast, where rebel broadcasters (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans, above at microphone) blasted the Stones, the Kinks, Jimi Hendrix and the Who over the airwaves. This angers a government minister (Kenneth Branagh) who wants to keep listeners safe with high culture and educational programming. The director of this movie, Richard Curtis, “isn’t concerned with exploring why gatekeepers might want to maintain the divide between high and popular culture,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “He wants to party. So he piles on the comic high jinks, lobs the jokes and cranks the splendid tunes.” Mr. Nighy can also be seen as a financially distressed British retiree lured to Jaipur, India, in John Madden’s “Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” (2012), at 4:45 on MoreMax, and as the washed-up rock star Billy Mack, angling for a comeback, in Mr. Curtis’s “Love Actually” (2003), at 8 on Showtime."

And yet evil characters are usually dynamic and fascinating, upstaging all the goody-goodies. Think of Milton’s blazing, sexy Satan; Balzac’s scheming, driven master criminal, Vautrin; or Shakespeare’s Iago. Despite the allure of such characters, writers today usually avoid them, maybe because the whole category of Evil seems too theological or because modern psychology assumes that every bad act can be traced to childhood neglect or abuse and thus be explained away. I have to give my students an assignment to write about bad guys in order to get them to do it. But when they do write about them, it’s such a release!"
Updike at Rest,2014-04-17,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",Adam Begley’s biography of John Updike surveys his work as well as his life.,"At first, he wanted to be a graphic artist. In 1954, John Updike — age 22, newly married and fresh out of Harvard, where he’d studied English literature and taken art courses — was awarded a fellowship to study abroad, and decided to apply to the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Arts in Oxford, England. Asked to explain this decision, Updike replied, “It’s always been my ambition to be the next Walt Disney.” During his childhood in Shillington, Pa., where he lived until the age of 13 and which his readers know through his Olinger stories, his mother, Linda, arranged for her prodigiously talented son to take lessons from a local artist. Later, when they moved to Plowville, 11 miles from Shillington, to a farmhouse he would describe in his novel “Of the Farm,” Updike — now 14 or 15 — began sending his drawings and cartoons to The New Yorker and other publications. For Updike, who was interested in drawing but also, like his mother, in writing, to be published in The New Yorker had been an ambition, if not an obsession, from the moment the magazine first entered the household when he was 12."

What’s On Friday,2014-04-18,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Nat Geo Wild) CESAR MILLAN: LOVE MY PIT BULL Once upon a time, the pit bull was a popular family pet beloved by President Theodore Roosevelt, Gen. George S. Patton and Helen Keller. Today, these dogs are more closely associated with gangs and dogfighting, and have been responsible for a large percentage of fatal dog attacks on humans. Pit bulls are often abused or abandoned, and are euthanized at a higher rate than other dogs, with an estimated one million put down each year in the United States. In this special, Mr. Millan chronicles the history of the pit bull as a herder and companion — in Britain, the Staffordshire bull terrier was nicknamed “the nanny dog” for its sweet disposition with children — and with his own pit bull, Junior (above, with Mr. Millan), makes the case for the dogs as loyal and loving, given the right training for both animals and humans. “All dogs are great companions,” he says. “Communication creates a partnership, and dogs have the simplest communication on the planet. For them, everything is about trust, respect and love.”"

Innocence Project,2014-04-18,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Raised by utopian parents, this novel’s brother and sister find it hard to navigate the world.","Hindsight is a wonderful thing. But in fiction it can take on a whole new power — blunderingly obvious or brightly illuminating, depending on how imaginatively it’s applied. Rare is the contemporary novel that doesn’t set out, at least in part, to examine the effects of past behavior on present outcomes. While this can lead to pungent and suspenseful storytelling, it requires a delicate balance, keeping the reader engaged in the narrative momentum of an unknown future that’s already in the past. In her perceptive, empathetic and often emotionally gripping new novel, Leah Hager Cohen — author of the acclaimed “The Grief of Others” — has managed the trick very deftly."
Three Siblings and a Murder,2014-04-18,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"This novel, set against the backdrop of 1960s London, abounds with political corruption and sexual scandal.","Peter Ackroyd’s new book begins like a fairy tale: “In the London borough of Camden, in the middle of the last century, there lived three brothers.” And a wondrous set of boys they are, having been born at precisely midday on May 8 of three successive years. This coincidence — only the first of many in Ackroyd’s breezy contrivance of a novel — signals an “invisible communion” among the brothers that will link their fates even as they set out on radically different paths through life. In the end, true to the Grimm Brothers template, only one will endure his personal ordeal and emerge relatively unscathed; the other two wind up succumbing to the wiles of the true hero of the piece — the city of London itself, the only character in the book the author actually seems to care about."
Predator and Prey,2014-04-18,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Nevada Barr’s Destroyer Angel,” the National Park Service ranger Anna Pigeon must revert to her animal nature to survive.","Nevada Barr has been brooding about the primal bonds between man and nature ever since her first mystery, “Track of the Cat,” came out more than 20 years ago. While respectfully acknowledging the forces of nature (the rampaging forest fire in “Firestorm” comes to mind, as does the harsh terrain of “Winter Study”), she has always found humans to be the more savage. In DESTROYER ANGEL (Minotaur, $26.99), Barr takes this insight to a disturbing new level by allowing her series detective, the National Park Service ranger Anna Pigeon, to test her belief that “animals were better people than people.” In order to survive, can she revert to her own animal nature, hunting and killing other human beings?"
Let’s Have a Dialogue,2014-04-18,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Philosophy']",A philosophical inquiry imagines Plato on an American book tour in the 21st century.,"Plato has begun to appear in some unexpected places. On the first track of Jay-Z and Kanye West’s hip-hop album, “Watch the Throne” (2011), you can pick out the line, “Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?” This, as classicists will instantly recognize, is an allusion to a dilemma posed in Plato’s dialogue “Euthyphro,” in which Socrates asks, “Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?” In Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s new book, “Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won’t Go Away,” Plato turns up not only at the search engine’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., but also with the obstreperous host of a cable news talk show, as a consultant to an advice columnist, and in several other places a long way from ancient Athens. In Goldstein’s neat finale, the pupil of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle eagerly disappears into the magnetic bowels of an fM.R.I. scanner to have his brain probed. "

Paabo was supposed to be studying viruses, but he had become secretly obsessed with a more exotic line of research: extracting DNA from Egyptian mummies. No one at the time had any idea if the desiccated flesh of pharaohs still contained any genetic material, so Paabo decided to run an experiment.

What’s on Monday,2014-04-21,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"3 P.M. (FX Movie Channel) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after people die by braiding together three story lines, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon, above), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, chooses a life of obscurity instead of exploiting his gift. In London, a solemn boy named Marcus feels the presence of his twin, Jason, whose violent death has left him adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris, Marie Lelay (Cécile de France), who nearly died in the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, is convinced that she has seen a metaphysical reality the world is determined to ignore. “Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this film, written by Peter Morgan. He added: “What does seem new — newly strange, newly beautiful — is what ‘Hereafter’ makes of the here and now. It is a curious movie in both senses of the word: an unusual experience and an open-ended inquiry into something nobody can really claim to understand. It leaves you wondering, which may be the most fitting way of saying that it’s wonderful.”"

What’s On Tuesday,2014-04-22,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (13, 49) A FIERCE GREEN FIRE (2013) At one time, it was about the dams.

Decades later, the proposed damming of the Colorado River prompted public outrage, and the environmental movement was born. Today some two million organizations worldwide work on behalf of social justice and the environment. In this Earth Day tribute, “American Masters” chronicles issues (pollution, whaling, conservation of the Amazon rain forest, climate change) within the fight and the players who made a difference (Lois Gibbs, who rallied on behalf of Love Canal; David Brower, above, the first executive director of the Sierra Club; and Paul Watson and Rex Weyler, the founders of Greenpeace). “The environmental movement is about nature versus humanity,” says Robert Redford, who with Meryl Streep, Ashley Judd, Van Jones and Isabel Allende narrates this documentary, directed by Mark Kitchell. “It arose at a time when our industrial civilization has grown so powerful it threatens the natural world on which we depend for survival.

So the list is dominated by lawmakers holding committee and subcommittee chairs, which are the gatekeepers for most bills. Of Mr. Rangel’s 41 pieces of legislation that have passed since 2003, when TrackBill started counting, only one was passed in the past three years.

This simple table summarizes our story on American living standards.,2014-04-22,article,Brief,,"['United States Economy', 'Income Inequality']",A quick look shows what has happened to incomes in recent decades.,"In 1980, the American rich and middle class and most of the poor had higher incomes than their counterparts almost anywhere in the world. But incomes for the middle class and poor in the United States have since been growing more slowly than elsewhere. Why? Among the reasons: This country has lost its once-wide lead in educational attainment. Other countries have increased their workers’ skill levels more quickly, helping create well-paying jobs. The United States also tolerates more inequality: The minimum wage is lower here. Executives make more money. The government redistributes less of it. By 2010, the poor in several other countries had pulled ahead. And Canada’s median income had reached a virtual tie with that of the United States. Since 2010, other data suggest Canada has moved ahead."

What’s On Wednesday,2014-04-23,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"5:05 P.M. (Starz Cinema) CHICKEN WITH PLUMS (2012) A celebrated but tormented violinist, Nasser-Ali (Mathieu Amalric, above), in 1958 Tehran retreats to his bed to end his life after his prized instrument is broken, in this drama from Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, based on Ms. Satrapi’s graphic novel of the same title. But in flashbacks — and flash-forwards — starring Nasser-Ali’s wife (Maria de Medeiros) and children (Mathis Bour and Enna Balland; Chiara Mastroianni and Christian Friedel portray them as adults), it soon becomes clear that his melancholy is rooted in a deeper heartache: his long-ago love, Irane (Golshifteh Farahani). “Not that ‘Chicken With Plums’ is gloomy,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Like its swooning, madly melodramatic musical score (by Olivier Bernet), the film takes an almost giddy pleasure in unhappiness, turning even pedestrian moments of boredom or discomfort into occasions for wild invention.” The result, which features a naked Sophia Loren and Edouard Baer as the Angel of Death, “is captivating, but not exactly moving.” "

These include the ability to launch herself off the playground slide into the sandbox, to make cupcakes disappear by sheer force of concentration, and to direct plants and inanimate objects to do her will by staying in one place."

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “As the title suggests, ‘Atonement’ is fundamentally about guilt and the attempt to overcome it, and about the tricky, tragically imperfect power of art to compensate for real-life crimes and misdemeanors.” The film received six more Oscar nominations, including one for best picture, and won for Dario Marianelli’s score, featuring the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and a clacking typewriter."

Nothing to Cheer About,2014-04-24,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Lacrosse']","An examination of the 2006 Duke lacrosse ordeal, and the dangerous balance between academics and college athletics.","It has become possible, these past several decades, to think of Duke as consisting of a professional basketball team to which, bizarrely, a research university has attached itself. But it is the “non­revenue” sports at Duke — and the school’s relentless, aggressive and very expensive campaign to build them into powerhouse brands — that have most radically changed the tenor of that campus. The strange centrality of the athletic program in the life of an academically excellent institution, and the many unintended consequences this situation has wrought, is the subject of William D. Cohan’s “The Price of Silence: The Duke Lacrosse Scandal, the Power of the Elite, and the Corruption of Our Great Universities.” The book is at once a masterwork of reporting and a devastating critique of a university that has lost its way.

What’s on Friday,2014-04-25,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (13) MATTHEW BOURNE’S SLEEPING BEAUTY In 1992, Mr. Bourne, the British choreographer, reinterpreted “The Nutcracker,” the first of three classic ballets set to scores by Tchaikovsky; in 1995, he unveiled his setting for “Swan Lake.” He completes the endeavor with this reimagining of the fairy tale about a princess who sleeps under a spell for 100 years, originally choreographed by Marius Petipa in 1890. Mr. Bourne’s version, taped at the Bristol Hippodrome in England, begins in that year with the birth of the heroine, Aurora (danced by Hannah Vassallo, above center, with Edwin Ray, left and Danny Reubens), who falls in love not with a prince but a gardener, Leo (Dominic North), and eventually awakens in the modern day. He also provides Leo with a rival, Caradoc (Adam Maskell), the dashingly vengeful son of the evil fairy who curses Aurora to death. “The love story that Mr. Bourne substitutes isn’t any more emotionally compelling than the original,” Brian Seibert wrote in his review of the production, presented here by Great Performances, in The New York Times. “Poetically, it’s a diminishment. The battle between good and evil is reduced to a tussle between the nice guy and the bad boy.” Still, he said, “Mr. Bourne is not an ungrateful recipient of the gift of Tchaikovsky’s score. He dedicates his ‘Sleeping Beauty’ to the composer, whose work will survive this version. It’s more than 100 years old and still likely to last as long as the undead.” "

Bruno’s group fixes on April 19 as the date for the Rapture, but as the title’s Darwinian allusion suggests, nothing divine will happen on their chosen mountain.

Certainly in this engrossing biography Miriam Pawel, a former editor and reporter with Newsday and The Los Angeles Times, is out to show both the good and bad. In the 1960s and early ’70s, Chavez did seem like a version of Gandhi. Organizing the dispossessed, our own untouchables, he fasted to the point of death, staged mass marches up and down California that resembled religious pilgrimages, and defeated growers with nationwide boycotts that even Gandhi would have found hard to duplicate. Back then, many of the best and saintliest of America’s young quit their jobs or dropped out of school to join up with Chavez and live lives of voluntary poverty. "

Inside the List,2014-04-25,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Gabrielle Zevin says her novel “The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry,” which features a cranky bookseller, is “the closest I’ll ever come to owning a bookstore.”","Behind the Counter: The protagonist of Gabrielle Zevin’s novel “The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry” — new at No. 15 on the hardcover fiction list — is a cranky bookstore owner, depressed after the death of his wife and the theft of a prized volume, who gradually perks up while caring for a baby abandoned in his shop. Book buyers, it turns out, like to read about booksellers. In the past few years, other best-selling examples include “The Marriage Bargain,” by Jennifer Probst (a billionaire proposes to a bookstore owner), “Murder of a Bookstore Babe,” by Denise Swanson (death by shelving), and “Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore,” by Robin Sloan (a web designer finds a night job at a mysterious shop). Yet Zevin recently told readers of The National Post in Canada that as appealing as the idea of running a bookstore is in theory, in reality she’s just not interested. “I think this is the pet pipe dream of many of us who love books,” she said. “I sometimes like to imagine the kind of bookstore I would run. I have, for instance, a deeply impractical idea for a performance art space/minimalist bookstore. The bookstore would only sell one title a month, and there would be a play or art installation of some kind based around that book. However, this is all just fantasy. Running a bookstore is ridiculously difficult, and the challenges bookstores face — e-books, online competition — are enormous. I suspect the closest I’ll ever come to owning a bookstore is having written ‘The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry.’ ”"

What’s on Saturday,2014-04-26,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9:40 A.M. (Starz Cinema) A WOMAN, A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP (2010) In this faithful remake of Joel and Ethan Coen’s “Blood Simple” (1984), the director Zhang Yimou moves the action from modern-day Texas to a desolate valley in northwest China in the feudal past, above, where the wife (Yan Ni) of a rich and sexually sadistic noodle-shop owner, Wang (Ni Dahong), is carrying on with one of his employees (Xiao Shenyang). Then Zhang (Sun Honglei), a detective hired by Wang to kill the adulterous couple, arrives on the scene, and all hell breaks loose. “Though it begins with some exaggerated, almost clownish business and includes a handful of clean and mordant sight gags, ‘A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop’ has a gravity that is surprising, given that it is basically the pastiche of a pastiche,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But by working through the self-conscious genre imitation that was something of a novelty in ‘Blood Simple,’ Mr. Zhang uncovers the primal, mythic intensity of the story and also changes the tone of its essential nihilism. The Coens posit a universe without order or meaning, and while Mr. Zhang does not necessarily quarrel with this view, he treats it less as a cosmic joke than as a grim folk tale.” "
