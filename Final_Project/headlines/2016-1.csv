Separating military men and women — and even the plasma in the wartime blood bank — by race, the government ratified racial apartheid in the South and introduced Jim Crow segregation into parts of the country where it had been unknown."

Rick Snyder of Michigan declared a state of emergency for the Flint area on Tuesday as concerns grew about the health effects of lead-tainted water there.

Mr. Snyder’s administration has been criticized as slow to respond to residents’ concerns about their water. Last week, he apologized and announced staffing changes at the state agency that oversees environmental quality.

Residents soon complained about rashes and strange odors from the river water, but city and state officials mostly insisted that it was safe to drink. Last year, elevated levels of lead were found in children’s blood, and in October, Flint switched back to Detroit’s water system. Mr. Snyder, a Republican, said Tuesday that the emergency declaration would allow for more state resources to be used in addressing the effects of the tainted water. "

Venezuela: New Lawmakers Defy Supreme Court,2016-01-07,article,Brief,,"['Legislatures and Parliaments', 'Constitutions']",The lawmakers swore in three three legislators who were blocked from taking their seats by the court last month.," Lawmakers on Wednesday swore in three legislators who were blocked from taking their seats by the Supreme Court last month, setting up a showdown with the president’s Socialist party. The opposition won a supermajority in the National Assembly on Dec. 6, ending the United Socialist Party’s 16-year-long grip on power. But before the new legislature could take charge, the Socialists approved 13 new Supreme Court justices, and days later, the court blocked four opposition lawmakers from taking their seats. That decision has created uncertainty about the supermajority, which the president’s rivals need to gain added powers, including the ability to remove Supreme Court justices and change the Constitution. On Wednesday, three of the four politicians were sworn in over objections of the Socialists. “What’s happening today is a flagrant violation of the Venezuelan Constitution,” said Diosdado Cabello, a Socialist lawmaker and the former leader of the Assembly. He said that the Socialists would ask the Supreme Court to find the Assembly leadership in contempt of the court order that blocked the politicians from taking their seats. "

Inside the List,2016-01-08,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Rosanna Pansino, whose “The Nerdy Nummies Cookbook” is No. 5 on the food and fitness list, is a YouTube star with more than three million subscribers to her online baking show.","Sugar and Spice: Every year around this time, when people are still recovering from the holidays and the main hardcover lists have settled into deep-freeze mode — a single new entry in the past four weeks! — it has become traditional for Inside the List to wander a little afield. Sometimes we reprint a list from years past. Sometimes we ask best-selling authors for their book-related wish lists or resolutions. This year, we bring you cookies: specifically, Rosanna Pansino’s atom cookies, from “The Nerdy Nummies Cookbook,” at No. 5 in its second month on the food and fitness list (available online). Pansino belongs to the growing club of YouTube stars who have crossed over into publishing; her online baking show, also called “Nerdy Nummies,” has more than three million subscribers who watch her take goofy delight in treats like doughnut waffles. (These are, literally, store-bought glazed doughnuts, heated and pressed in a home waffle iron. I’m not sure that qualifies as baking, but it sounds amazing.) If you suspect that Pansino’s appeal has as much to do with charm and presentation as with the actual recipes, her book probably won’t change your mind. But she is charming, in her way. Here’s how she introduces those atom cookies, which are just six-pointed sugar cookies iced and decorated to resemble a science class’s atom model, with an M&M nucleus and candy pearl electrons: “Atoms are the building blocks of every type of matter in the universe — even you! My grandfather was a nuclear physicist, my uncle followed in his footsteps, and my dad’s old high school even had an atom on its emblem. I guess you could say we have an atomic bond. I decorated my atoms green, blue and purple, but you can make your atom cookies any color you want. Just remember: Never trust an atom . . . they make up everything!”"

"‘The Sleep of the Righteous,’ by Wolfgang Hilbig",2016-01-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Stories sketch the life of an émigré dogged by his past. ,"The brutality, betrayals and deadening conformity of East Germany have provided fodder for a long list of celebrated writers. Christa Wolf won acclaim for her nuanced critiques of the now defunct Communist dictatorship, though her reputation took a beating with her admission that she had served as a ­Stasi informant. Heiner Müller’s scathing dramas challenged the authoritarian regime and earned him scorn as a “historical pessimist.” Then there was Wolfgang Hilbig, born in Saxony in 1941, who shoveled coal in a factory boiler room before discovering his true calling. Permitted to resettle in West Germany in 1985, he began attracting attention for his evocations of the East’s apocalyptic postwar landscape and the dislocations of a Cold War-era émigré who felt like an outsider in both societies.

"‘Paradise City,’ by Elizabeth Day",2016-01-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A novel sets the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case in London.,"Novels in which separate story lines collide often give the impression that even the most disparate people are somehow connected. And when that collision occurs through an act of violence, it’s sometimes assumed that other differences can be ignored — because, after all, what life has been lived without some pain and suffering? At best, such stories come across as saccharine odes to our shared humanity. But in a novel like Elizabeth Day’s tale of contemporary London, “Paradise City,” they can seem to exploit the circumstances of the less fortunate and the marginalized."

It’s a feeling supported by a common story about ­history: The anti-abortion movement began after Roe v. Wade, because conservative evangelicals were threatened by women’s newfound power over their bodies. What else could explain the movement’s swift rise in the decade following the Supreme Court’s decision, if not a widespread reaction against equal rights?"
Dave Hickey’s ‘25 Women: Essays on Their Art’,2016-01-08,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Art']",The controversial critic Dave Hickey claims the label of feminist.,"“Most of my favorite people are women,” Dave Hickey proclaims in the introduction to “25 Women.” This statement, and indeed the whole book, can be read as a response to the accusations of sexism that have followed Hickey since the culture wars of the ’90s, when he published “The Invisible Dragon,” a series of cantankerous essays attacking the academic art establishment. According to Hickey, beauty, once the handmaiden of art, had been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness by a censorious ring of tenured apparatchiks. Hickey’s antagonists fought back. For the feminist critic Amelia Jones, his “revival of an abstract notion of ‘beauty’ ” served to validate “a particular group of critics (almost all white men) as having access to the truth.” For its critics, beauty was hardly innocent or self-evident, but hampered with cultural baggage: the objectification of women, the exclusion of minorities and the meretricious seductions of the marketplace.

Norrell",2016-01-08,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Blacks', 'Black People', 'Writing and Writers']",Alex Haley brought attention to black America.,"In 1977 Alex Haley, the author of the best-selling “Autobiography of Malcolm X,” achieved world renown after ABC broadcast an eight-part version of his book “Roots,” published the previous year to great acclaim. “Roots,” which chronicled Haley’s search for his African ancestors (and in doing so created a template for the genealogical boom reflected in popular series like “Finding Your Roots,” with Henry Louis Gates Jr.), became an international phenomenon that turned the financially insecure Haley into an icon. Yet Haley’s newfound celebrity and wealth proved to be a double-edged sword. Allegations of plagiarism and historical inaccuracies scarred him, diminishing his literary reputation, and, argues the historian Robert J. Norrell in his briskly paced “Alex Haley: And the Books That Changed a Nation,” unfairly tarnished the author of “the two most influential books on African-American history in the second half of the 20th century.”"

Not so. The event itself came rather late for Mei Fong’s “One Child.” But she makes disconcertingly clear that the repercussions of population control will continue to reverberate throughout China. The policy itself remains a monument to official callousness, and Fong’s book pays moving testimony to the suffering and forbearance of its victims."

A city called Zelenograd came to life on the outskirts of Moscow and was populated with all manner of brainy Soviet engineers. The hope — naturally — was that a concentration of clever minds coupled with ample funding would result in a wellspring of innovation and help Russia keep pace with California’s electronics boom. The experiment worked as well as one might expect. Few people will read this on a Mayakovsky-branded tablet or ­smartphone."
"‘Dictator,’ by Robert Harris",2016-01-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The final volume of Harris’s Ancient Rome trilogy follows Cicero’s last years.,"Cicero, the Roman statesman whose talent for oratory was such that he remains to this day a byword for eloquence, has always divided opinion. A key player in the death agony of Rome’s traditional republican system of government, he was lauded by his admirers as a defender of constitutional propriety and dismissed by his foes as a vacillating opportunist. Posterity has proved similarly conflicted. While America’s founding fathers revered him as a model of civic duty, he was excoriated by the most formidable German classicist of the 19th century, Theodor Mommsen, as a precursor of that lowest class of writer, a “newspaper columnist.” A person’s attitude to Cicero can often be most revealing.

"Review: In Michael Bay’s ‘13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,’ Clarity Isn’t the Objective",2016-01-14,article,Review,,['Movies'],Mr. Bay has moderately scaled back his extreme-cinema approach for the story about the attack on the American diplomatic mission in 2012.,"Slipped into “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,” among the torrential bullets and convulsive mayhem, is a protracted advertisement for a Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. A dramatization of the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Libya that resulted in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, the movie is a pummeling slog — 45 minutes of setup and an eternity of relentless combat. So it’s a relief when the director Michael Bay, amid this bleak fusillade, provides a little zigzagging action-movie-style relief. You can’t help but admire how well the truck holds up with its wheels aflame, like a 21st-century chariot of fire."

They Have Not Yet Begun To Fight,2016-01-15,article,News,,"['Political Advertising', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Presidential Election of 2016']",Why I’m not yet resigned to a Trump vs. Cruz race.,"In last night’s Republican debate we finally got the Donald Trump vs. Ted Cruz clash everyone has been pining for — not on policy, of course, but on the crucial questions of Cruz’s Canuckishness and Trump’s “New York values.” Cruz came prepared on both exchanges, and like others I would say that he won the night, though he did disappear for longish stretches later on and took some strafing fire from Marco Rubio (very) late in the evening. But then I also agree with the observers who think Trump fundamentally had a good night as well: The Donald has learned a lot about debating since this show started, and even when placed on the defensive he was effective and disciplined — responding to Cruz on the Canadian issue with more puckishness than bluster and then pivoting smoothly to 9/11 on the “New York values” issue. And then there was this moment, when a question about Nikki Haley’s post-SOTU critique of the party’s “angriest voices” allowed Trump to deliver — pretty calmly and evenly — what was probably the line of the night, if not of his campaign: “She did say there was anger. I’m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.”"
"‘City of Thorns,’ by Ben Rawlence",2016-01-15,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Refugees and Displaced Persons']","An intimate look inside the world’s largest refugee settlement, on the Kenya-Somalia border.","In 2010, Ben Rawlence, then a researcher for Human Rights Watch, visited the refugee camp of Dadaab on the eastern Kenyan border, home to 300,000 people, many of whom had fled the chronic civil war in Somalia. The next year, he returned for what would be the first of seven long visits to follow the lives of nine of its inhabitants and to watch the camp grow until it became the largest refugee settlement in the world, more town than camp, with its own hospitals, cinemas and soccer teams, occupying an area the size of New Orleans. It would be good to be able to say that his story is encouraging or uplifting; but Rawlence’s “City of Thorns” is a deeply disturbing and depressing portrait of the violence, destitution, fear, sense of hopelessness and neglect in which a large number of the world’s estimated 60 million forcibly displaced people now live."

Inside the List,2016-01-15,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Alan Dean Foster’s movie novelization, new at No. 1, is the first “Force Awakens” tie-in to hit the adult hardcover list.","The List Awakens: Alan Dean Foster’s movie novelization “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” goes right to the top in its first week on the hardcover fiction list. This isn’t the only best seller to spring from Disney’s reboot — an illustrated junior novelization has spent three weeks on the middle-grade hardcover list, where it’s currently No. 2, and other titles have landed on the kids’ series list and the miscellaneous list — but it is the first “Force Awakens” tie-in to hit adult hardcover. So what, besides Chewbacca’s drunken sex scene, makes this an adult book? (I’m only kidding about Chewie — sorry! — but readers curious about the mating habits of wookies can turn to The Guardian, where an Edinburgh zookeeper reports that “I would assume they would do it pretty much the same way we do it.” If you’re like me, this will have you humming Cole Porter for days.) In fact, Foster’s novelization does contain some scenes of graphic violence missing from the movie, but the most adult thing about it may be the florid vocabulary. Here’s how it describes the villain Kylo Ren, for instance: “saturnine of aspect, lithe of build, tortured of mien and troubled of eye.” Keep the children away."

While not every teenager is a violin prodigy, Etta’s situation shares common themes with the lives of many driven young people, and right from the opening moments of “Passenger” there is much to like about her. When Etta’s elderly teacher, the most supportive figure in her life, becomes suddenly discouraging on the night of the recital, and Etta overhears an argument between her teacher and her mother as she is about to go onstage, the dramatic tension is ratcheted up, promising an engaging narrative about ambition and family.

Although media coverage of what transpired over the protests’ five chaotic days in November focused on police brutality and destruction of property, in its full reality, the “Battle in Seattle” swung from hope-filled carnival to angry riot to a moment of real change — a polyvalent, ambiguous and high-stakes drama.

Key Jr. identified the Democratic defeat as “so demoralizing and so thorough that the party could make little headway in regrouping its forces until 1916.” The scale of this Republican success — a moment that ushered in a period of Republican Party ascendance that lasted until the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 — draws the attention of the prominent political strategist Karl Rove, who also views McKinley’s victory over the charismatic William Jennings Bryan as pivotal.

The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don’t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything — a product, a service, a corporate acquisition — that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash."

The point about the past, in Hadley’s fiction, is that it’s always there to trip you up.

It was his book “The Conservative Mind” (1953) that first used the word “conservative” to classify various currents of antiprogressive dissidence that ran from the French Revolution to the 20th-century heyday of social democracy. Kirk’s book was an event. After a recommendation from Whittaker Chambers, Time magazine devoted the entire book review section to it. And Kirk had other gifts. He was a capable writer of ghost and fantasy novels. He founded and edited two prestigious journals. Not just Strauss and Chambers but also T. S. Eliot and Ray Bradbury esteemed him. In 1955, Flannery O’Connor, scarcely able to walk, traveled 340 miles in hopes of seeing him lecture in ­Tennessee."
