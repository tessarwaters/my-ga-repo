One of the oldest existing running shoes, from the 1860s, will be featured, along with 1920s Keds.

Sanders, soloists; Douglas Kinney Frost, conductor; Harlem String Quartet(Cantaloupe Music)Mysticism and entertainment make strange bedfellows. But Mr. Lang’s chamber opera, based on a one-page story by Ambrose Pierce about a slave owner who vanishes into thin air while crossing a field in pre-Civil War Alabama, manages to combine pathos, satire and meditation to strangely addictive effect. Together with the librettist Mac Wellman, Mr. Lang mines the story for all its weird urgency and wonder. The music, performed by a fine roster of singers and actors against a now sparse, now seething instrumental accompaniment shows this composer at his most inventive.

The selections include roles that have become her trademarks, including Violetta from “Traviata,” as well as parts she has yet to perform on stage, like Nedda in “Pagliacci.” In all the arias, Ms. Damrau’s impeccable technique and emotional commitment yield alluring results.

"‘The Truth and Other Lies,’ by Sascha Arango",2015-07-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A best-selling author schemes to conceal his role in murder and literary fraud.,"“You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style,” says Humbert Humbert in “Lolita.” Humbert is a pedophile and a murderer. Henry Hayden (another H.H.), the protagonist of “The Truth and Other Lies,” by Sascha Arango, is merely a murderer, though, like Humbert, a man of discernment. He’s a world-­famous, best-selling novelist, with millions of copies sold around the world, a winner of awards and a recipient of honorary degrees. He drives a Maserati, wears expensive suits and lives in splendor in a coastal town in, apparently, Germany."
"‘Book of Numbers,’ by Joshua Cohen",2015-07-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A failed novelist is tasked with producing a tech mogul’s memoirs. ,"“For last year’s words belong to last year’s language,” T.S. Eliot wrote, “and next year’s words await another voice.” It would be hard to find a more apt description of Joshua Cohen and his brilliantly exhausting fourth novel, “Book of Numbers.” On its surface, the book is about a struggling New York novelist hired as an Internet billionaire’s ghostwriter — but its breadth, the ambition of its ideas and devices, confounds standard book review responses. Trying to approach this ­demanding, overstuffed novel is a bit like hyperlinking one’s way around the Internet: It’s bigger, wilder and fuller than you imagined, and there’s always more where that came from."

Nathaniel Popper’s ‘Digital Gold’ Looks at Bitcoin,2015-07-02,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Bitcoin (Currency)']",A journalist profiles the developers and devotees who have aided the rise of cybercurrency.,"If you wanted to create an entirely new world, like that in “Star Wars,” or in Neal Stephenson’s “Cryptonomicon,” you would certainly need an entirely new form of money. As Nathaniel Popper points out in his new book, “Digital Gold,” which tracks the roller-coaster ride of the digital currency called Bitcoin, it’s not surprising that part of its appeal to its devotees is that it could enable the creation of that new world, a libertarian utopia. Bitcoins — which are created, or mined, via complex computer algorithms, and are stored in digital wallets — offer privacy: Although every transaction is recorded, the users are identified only by wallet IDs, which are difficult, if not impossible, to track back to their owners. Theoretically, Bitcoins also allow users to avoid any fees or meddling by a middleman like a bank, because buyers and sellers can deal directly with one another. At its grandest, Bitcoin promises freedom from the clunkiness of cash, from the dominance of central banks and from technology that allows us to be tracked, even by our own governments. On a more prosaic level, why shouldn’t money be as vulnerable to technological disruption as, say, music?"

How much can the writer invent without betraying the reader’s trust? And, conversely, how much must the writer invent in order to transform history, in all its messiness, into fiction with a satisfying narrative arc and fully developed characters?"

She is a cockroach. At least her mother refers to her this way, as when she castigates her posture: “Cucaracha!” she yells. “Stand up straight!” Adding insult to insecthood, a birthmark on the child’s right cornea limits her vision. In order to strengthen the extraocular muscles, she must wear a flesh-hued cloth over her good eye. She resists putting it on each morning, but once it is secured, she submits to being “a patched child” until 5 o’clock, when she is allowed to remove it."

Etgar Keret’s ‘The Seven Good Years: A Memoir’,2015-07-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An Israeli writer describes a parent’s daily life in a combat zone.,"Etgar Keret’s story collections are like good punk rock records: fast, fun and cultishly admired. And yet despite the inclusion of a few foundation-rattling standouts, even the best punk records ultimately leave the listener under the spell of undiminishing sameness. The same goes for Keret’s collections. Not that Keret is completely to blame; his genre is the parable, and if it weren’t for the demands of the market, these stories would be individually packaged rather than bound in books. The best of Keret’s stories, “Surprise Egg,” say, from his 2006 collection “The Nimrod Flipout,” explode with distortion. In the case of that particular story, there’s also an actual explosion — a suicide bomb — and the story’s power lies in the immediacy of its ending: a bomb-­widowed husband dreams of the foot of his dead wife slowly stroking his face. Keret forgoes easy moralizing and refuses to politicize the personal or to offer an obvious message. When Keret, who is Israeli and writes in Hebrew, first appeared in English, he was hailed as a savior of short stories from the dour realism of Raymond Carver, and a liberator of Israeli fiction from the big-picture density of writers like David Grossman. His stories were unapologetically absurd and libidinous, and if they weren’t all winners, then at least there was something refreshing in Keret’s imaginative conceits."

The book paints a fairly tawdry picture of Madison’s years as Hugh Hefner’s girlfriend — or, more accurately, as the “No. 1 girlfriend” in a volatile harem rife with infighting, sexual competition and petty jealousies over money and favors. (I told you it was tawdry.) Hef has accused Madison of “rewriting history,” a claim she shrugged off in a recent interview with The Associated Press: “He doesn’t have any mental or emotional power over me anymore,” she said. “He’s somebody that I look back on as somebody who treated me really poorly, who I tried to convince myself was a great person but I don’t think is. And I don’t want negative, toxic people in my life anymore.” All of this is a good excuse, if you needed one, to dig up a copy of Gloria Steinem’s 1963 exposé of the Playboy Club in New York City, where she briefly assumed a false name and went undercover in the standard satin costume, complete with ears and a rabbit tail. “A middle-­aged man in a private guard’s uniform grinned and beckoned,” Steinem wrote. “ ‘Here bunny, bunny, bunny,’ he said, and jerked his thumb toward the glass door on the left. ‘Interviews downstairs in the Playmate Bar.’ ” Madison might recognize the world Steinem was writing about, even if it had less silicone than she’s used to; evidently, the bunnies of Steinem’s era padded their bosoms with plastic dry-cleaning bags."

The cast of this Oscar nominee for best picture includes Brad Pitt, above, and Cate Blanchett as an American couple trying to move beyond the death of their infant son; Adriana Barraza as their housekeeper; Gael García Bernal as a reckless nephew; and Rinko Kikuchi as a deaf teenage girl. “On paper, very little of it makes sense, but what is on screen has an almost physical impact,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “In the end ‘Babel,’ like that tower in the Book of Genesis, is a grand wreck, an incomplete monument to its own limitless ambition.

Many went straight to their deaths, including about 870,000 Jews murdered on arrival and without registration at Auschwitz; others endured a slower annihilation, reduced to what Hannah Arendt called “ghastly marionettes with human faces.” Millions more were killed in other ways, but there were also survivors, and at the end of “KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps,” his monumental study of the SS camps, Nikolaus Wachsmann focuses on one. His name is Moritz Choinowski, a Polish-born Jew detained by the Gestapo in 1939 in the German town of Magdeburg. By the time of his liberation on April 29, 1945, Choinow­ski has survived Buchenwald, Auschwitz, a slowly growing German camp called Gross-Rosen and finally Dachau, as well as the nightmarish forms of transportation between them. “Is this possible?” he sobs in the Dachau infirmary.

"‘Among the Ten Thousand Things,’ by Julia Pierpont",2015-07-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A husband’s affair, cruelly revealed, leaves his family’s future uncertain.","In some cases, the key to the success of a longstanding marriage may not be in its well-kept secrets but in its tacit agreements. Many a promiscuous spouse has been allowed room to roam as long as his or her dalliances aren’t flaunted. I remember reading an interview with Magic Johnson’s wife, Cookie, in this very newspaper in May 1996, five years after he was told he had been infected with H.I.V. When she came to Los Angeles to visit, “he always respected me,” she said. “It’s not that I thought he was a saint. But I didn’t know what was happening, and I preferred it that way.” If a marriage is sufficiently loving (as the Johnsons’ apparently still is) or satisfying or economically advantageous, maybe it isn’t worth blowing up if the person being betrayed is given the opportunity to turn a blind eye."

What Are the Limits of ‘Religious Liberty’?,2015-07-07,article,News,,"['Freedom of Religion', 'English Language', 'Discrimination', 'Conservatism (US Politics)', 'Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships', 'Birth Control and Family Planning', 'ABORTION', 'Law and Legislation']","The law has always made room for the needs of believers, but lately doctrine is being invoked to justify intolerance.","‘‘I can’t. It’s against my religion.’’ Americans tend to handle religious objections with care, personally and politically. When a guest says, for example, that he can’t eat the food being served because it’s not kosher or halal, the host usually hastens to find an alternative. And when people resist following a law on the basis of faith, the government and the courts may try to accommodate them. It’s an American legacy that dates back to before the founding, when some of the original colonies were set up as havens for religious dissenters. Under the banner of belief, Quakers and Mennonites in the 18th century won the right not to join state militias. The first conscientious objectors were religious objectors, and from there, the category expanded to include moral opponents of war. The same pattern holds for home-schoolers. It was an Amish father, not a hippie mother, who first got the Supreme Court’s permission to take his children out of school in 1972, based on his religious commitment to ‘‘life aloof from the world,’’ as the justices respectfully put it."
Unstarched Shirt,2015-07-07,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Trademarks and Trade Names']","The polo used to be part of a preppy uniform.

In 1926, he won the United States National Championship wearing the same shirt but with its sleeves cut short: a daring evolutionary step toward an archetype of sportswear. In 1933, Lacoste went into business with a knitwear manufacturer to mass-produce la chemise Lacoste, a short-sleeved pullover with a turndown collar, three buttons on its placket and a breathable piqué-cotton body. Ads extolled its suitability not just for le tennis and le golf but also for la plage (the beach): not just for athletic exertion but for general leisure. The shirt was not rigid, but there was a rectitude to it. It promoted physical comfort while adhering to social strictures. The line from there to casual Friday runs fairly straight."

That complex and compelling opera was finally given its premiere in Santa Fe in 2010. This recording offers his 2012 vespers cantata, “Hesperus Is Phosphorus,” performed by the Philadelphia forces that commissioned it: the Crossing, the superb contemporary-music vocal ensemble, and Network for New Music. The title plays on the belief of the early Greeks that Phosphorus was the morning star, and Hesperus the evening one, before they realized that the two were one celestial body, Venus. The inventive text draws together writings by David Eagleman, Wallace Stevens, Richard Feynman, Wallace Shawn and others. Mr. Spratlan’s pungently modern language comes through continually in this intricate 65-minute score. Still, he sets words for clarity, often in long stretches of spiky block chords. A beautiful recording of a sensual and mysterious work. (ANTHONY TOMMASINI)"

In December 2011 the doors closed, most of the artifacts were shipped out and crews of workers moved in for a $10 million restoration. Strollers on the grounds have been able to sit on its big front porch or press their noses to the windows, but the house itself has been locked up tight."

On this commonality rests the hopes of the National Ballet of China’s 2008 production of “Peony Pavilion,” which itself seeks to fulfill a dream: to create a Western ballet with Chinese characteristics."

Inside the List,2015-07-10,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"“The Little Paris Bookshop,” No. 16 on the hardcover fiction list, is the first international hit for the German novelist Nina George, who has written almost 30 books in 22 years.","Best Regards: The German novelist Nina George is prolific: In the 22 years since she started her career at age 19, she has written almost 30 books, including mysteries, relationship guides and steamy romances. (“Americans get all finicky when it comes to the graphic nature of my erotic scenes,” she has said. “They prefer to leave a lot of it up to the imagination: more Barbie doll sexlessness, less Anaïs Nin eroticism.”) But with “The Little Paris Bookshop,” new at No. 16 on the hardcover fiction list, George has her first bona fide international hit, the tale of a lovelorn bookseller who peddles his wares from a barge on the Seine and sees his calling as one part matchmaker, one part witch doctor. “There are books that are suitable for a million people, others for only a hundred,” he explains. “There are even remedies — I mean books — that were written for one person only.” The novel’s success has introduced George, happily, to the world of international publishing, as she describes at some length on her website: “The captains and navigators in publishing are women! From agents to list managers, women negotiate with other women on everything from money and content to sales,” she writes. “The agents and publishers always sign their first names to their emails: Vanessa, Cecile, Mirjam. From New York to Paris, they write: ‘Best regards/Yours, Christine, Rowan, Anna, Hedda, Elise.’ They discuss money with the cold clarity of a glass of vodka. No dancing around the issue as is so often the case in Germany. What’s even more cathartic, though, is the praise I’ve received from Cecile, Rowan, Anna, Hedda and Christine. No praise for my work has ever been as profuse and sincere as the compliments I’ve received from these foreign publishers in Paris, New York, Rome, Amsterdam and Riga. First they bought my book, then they wrote me long letters explaining what they liked about it. I suspect the reluctance to compliment authors and their novels is a typically German phenomenon. What if it makes the author too expensive? Or if the accolades go to her head? Or if she becomes, somehow, too difficult to work with? Nonsense! Bring on the praise, my dear German book people! It is pure joy.”"

That model has collapsed, for now, but Ms. Clarkson remains — not quite the reliable hitmaker she was five or 10 years ago, but still one of the most technically precise executors in pop.

Niele Toroni’s Five Decades of Interval Training,2015-07-15,article,News,,"['Art', 'Museums']","The Swiss artist explains his conceptual, minimalist approach in a video premiering exclusively at T.","Switzerland’s political reputation as a global mediator may be well earned, but when it comes to the nation’s gold mine of artists, a kind of creative isolationism is still in effect — rarely do they exhibit outside of Europe. But this summer, Niele Toroni, a Swiss painter born in Muralto (the Italian-speaking border region nestled in the high peaks of Locarno), lands at the Swiss Institute for his first-ever solo institutional show in New York. At 78, Toroni has formed an everlasting bond to repetition, and abides by a pact he made in 1967 proclaiming autonomy, or painting free of representation. His “Travail-Peinture” method never wavers: He makes strokes with a number 50 paintbrush at 30-centimeter intervals. Toroni is a marquee name in the French minimalist BMPT group (Daniel Buren, Olivier Mosset, Michel Parmentier, Toroni), and his faithfulness to conceptualism is particularly Zen. The painter, who has resided in Paris since 1959, “is often asked why he is doing the same thing,” explains Clément Delépine, the assistant curator of Swiss Institute, in a video premiering exclusively here at T. “You have to understand that in his mind he’s not doing the same thing. It varies in shape, width, varies depending the pressure.” As the video slyly reveals, repetition needn’t be redundant."

Here, old-school stalwarts mingle with artsy young people, helping to create a city that serves as a canvas for the kind of urban dreams that more crowded and expensive cities can’t foster. It’s a place where abandoned buildings reveal art museums in the making, where decaying industrial sites prove ripe for urban exploration, where residential streets hide kitchens turning out remarkably fresh, local food.

What’s On TV Friday,2015-07-17,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) THE REWRITE (2015) Keith Michaels (Hugh Grant, above), a former A-list screenwriter who hasn’t had a hit since winning an Oscar in 1999, takes a last-ditch job at Binghamton University in upstate New York, choosing his students — the prettiest women, naturally — by scouring their Facebook profiles instead of their writing samples. Those who pass muster include Karen (Bella Heathcote), whom he immediately beds, and Holly (Marisa Tomei), a single mother. Then he meets his nemesis (Allison Janney), a scowling Jane Austen scholar and head of the college ethics committee. “The smart, needling dialogue” in the opening scenes “sets a high standard that the rest of the movie can’t maintain, as the story settles into a formulaic tale about a scoundrel’s redemption,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this fourth collaboration between Mr. Grant and the director and screenwriter Marc Lawrence. “That Mr. Grant can bring Keith back from the edge more or less persuasively is a testament to his ability to convey genuine humility without mawkishness, once he sees the light.”"

Meanwhile, a real-life spy story has climbed onto the hardcover nonfiction list: “The Billion Dollar Spy,” by the journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author David E. Hoffman, is new at No. 13. Hoffman’s book traces the Cold War exploits of Adolf Tolkachev, a Soviet military engineer who for years passed secrets to the C.I.A. “He put the documents in his coat,” Hoffman told NPR this month, “and he walked out of that top-secret institute at the lunch hour back to his apartment, which was a 20-minute walk, and he took out a camera and he photographed the pages and then he went back to work and put them back in the file. And he did this for years.” One way the book brings its subject to life, as Scott Shane noted in his review for The New York Times’s daily Arts section, is through the detail that Tolkachev asked his American handlers to pass along rock ’n’ roll for his teenage son, including Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Beatles. “My son, as many of his contemporaries in school, has a passion for Western music,” he explained in one letter. “I too, in spite of my age, like to listen to this music.”"

The Pope may now be expected to withdraw to Castel Gundolfi for the rest of the hot season, as was in former days the invariable custom of his predecessors. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 19, 1890"

Iraq: Toll Rises in Market Bombing,2015-07-18,article,Brief,,"['Terrorism', 'Shiite Muslims']","The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a bombing in eastern Iraq, and officials on Saturday said that the death toll had risen to 100 people, with 20 more missing."," The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a bombing in eastern Iraq, and officials on Saturday said that the death toll had risen to 100 people, with 20 more missing. The bomb tore through a marketplace on Friday in Khan Bani Saad, above, a mostly Shiite town in Diyala Province. It also wounded at least 133 people, the police said, and destroyed several buildings. Government troops and Shiite militias months ago wrested back parts of the province from the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In a statement taking responsibility for the blast, ISIS, which has often singled out Shiites as targets, declared that the attack was revenge for what it called a massacre of Sunnis in the town of Hawija farther north. The statement may have been referring to an episode in March, during a battle that eventually drove ISIS from Tikrit. Residents of Hawija reported at the time that dozens of ISIS fighters had been killed by their commanders for trying to flee the battlefield. ISIS, which follows an extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam, views Shiites as apostates and has often targeted Shiite civilians. Its statement declared that it used three tons of explosives to kill and injure more than 180 “apostates.” Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that ISIS was targeting civilians in revenge for recent government advances.

China: 2 Relatives of a Tibetan Monk Who Died in Prison Have Been Arrested,2015-07-19,article,Brief,,"['Monasteries and Monks', 'Prisons and Prisoners']",The authorities in southwest China have reportedly detained two relatives of a prominent Tibetan monk whose unexplained death in prison set off protests that left dozens injured after it was announced on Monday.," The authorities in southwest China have reportedly detained two relatives of a prominent Tibetan monk whose unexplained death in prison set off protests that left dozens injured after it was announced on Monday. According to Students for a Free Tibet, an overseas advocacy group, the police on Friday detained the sister and niece of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, 65, a widely revered monk and community leader who was serving a life sentence on terrorism and separatism charges. Human rights advocates contend that the allegations against him were politically motivated. He died in a prison near Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, under circumstances that the authorities have yet to explain. On Thursday, prison officials, brushing aside the pleas of family members and supporters, cremated his body rather than allow them to carry out traditional Buddhist funeral rites. Witnesses say the relatives, Dolkar Lhamo, 52, and her daughter, Nyima Lhamo, 25, were detained in Chengdu on Friday, according to Padma Dolma, campaigns director for Students for a Free Tibet. Dolkar Lhamo and another sister were among nearly 100 Tibetans who staged a sit-in outside the building in Chengdu where Tenzin Delek was thought to have been imprisoned for the 13 years before he died.

Inside the List,2015-07-24,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “Between the World and Me,” which enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1, is an incantatory essay about being black in America.","Not O.K.: Ta-Nehisi Coates’s new book, “Between the World and Me” — an incantatory essay about being black in America, framed as a letter to his teenage son — enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1. Like another recent best seller, Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen,” the book burns with moral intelligence about the daily humiliations and degradations confronting black people, and refuses the easy consolations of hope and uplift. Early on, Coates addresses his son’s despair over the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Mo. “I didn’t comfort you,” he writes, “because I thought it would be wrong to comfort you. I did not tell you that it would be O.K., because I have never believed it would be O.K. What I told you is what your grandparents tried to tell me: that this is your country, that this is your world, that this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it. I tell you now that the question of how one should live within a black body, within a country lost in the Dream, is the question of my life, and the pursuit of this question, I have found, ultimately answers itself.” (The “dream” at issue is of course the American dream, which Coates points out depends on a vision of innocence that willfully ignores the American sins of slavery and institutional racism.) Some commentators have taken Coates to task for emphasizing social and historical frameworks more than personal choice and responsibility, but a recent profile in New York magazine leaves no question where he stands on that debate. “Coates noticed the good people on the wrong side of history,” the reporter Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes, “suggesting that individual virtue was a weak counter­weight to the pathologies of states. Had he been alive and had means, he tweeted, ‘I would have owned slaves too.’ ”"

They’d rather hand carry a refrigerator than make the plunge, but Jean could do it blindfolded.”"

Should We Fear the Political ‘Crazies’?,2015-07-27,article,News,,"['United States Politics and Government', 'English Language', 'Presidential Election of 2016']","When John McCain referred to people who attended an anti-immigration rally as ""crazies,” he was trying to marginalize supporters of Donald Trump. But is the political status quo any saner?","The melee began, as they often do in politics, with simple umbrage. ‘‘This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,’’ Senator John McCain told Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker. He was referring to a massive rally that Donald Trump held a few days earlier in July to protest illegal immigration. McCain then followed with the kill shot. ‘‘What he did,’’ he said of Trump, ‘‘was he fired up the crazies.’’ In the annals of political deprecation, McCain’s charge of rallying the ‘‘crazies’’ was not terribly inspired. It was a far cry from, say, Teddy Roosevelt’s remark that William McKinley ‘‘has the backbone of a chocolate éclair’’ or Winston Churchill’s description of Clement Attlee, the British prime minister, as ‘‘a sheep in sheep’s clothing.’’ This was not even a Top 5 effort by McCain, who will sometimes refer to reporters as ‘‘Trotskyites’’ (often with affection) and last year dismissed protesters who interrupted a Senate hearing as ‘‘lowlife scum’’ (without affection). McCain is not so much a put-down artist as he is gifted at caricaturing entire sectors and viewpoints by way of dismissing them — in this case the border hawks who turned out for Trump."

"‘The Complete Stories,’ by Clarice Lispector",2015-07-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Clarice Lispector’s “Complete Stories” is proof that she was one of the true originals of Latin American literature.,"There’s a whiff of madness in the fiction of Clarice Lispector. The “Complete Stories” of the great Brazilian writer, edited by Benjamin Moser and sensitively translated by Katrina Dodson, is a dangerous book to read quickly or casually because it’s so consistently delirious. Sentence by sentence, page by page, Lispector is exhilaratingly, arrestingly strange, but her perceptions come so fast, veer so wildly between the mundane and the metaphysical, that after a while you don’t know where you are, either in the book or in the world. “Coherence, I don’t want it anymore,” a character in one of her stories thinks. “Coherence is mutilation. I want disorder.” That character, a 37-year-old woman in melancholy flight from her husband or lover, has this revelation too: “It was a lie to say you could only have one thought at a time: She had many thoughts that intersected and were multiple.” Especially in the 1970s, in the last decade of Lispector’s life, when that story (“The Departure of the Train”) and two of her best, most challenging novels — “Água Viva” and “The Hour of the Star” — were written, she was trying to get all her own intersecting, helplessly multiplying thoughts on the page. She failed, of course, but failed beautifully. Her willed disorder is heroic."

What’s on TV Wednesday,2015-07-29,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"3 P.M. (FX Movie Channel) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after people die by braiding together three stories, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, chooses a life of obscurity instead of exploiting his gift. In London, a boy feels the presence of his twin, whose death has left him adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris, Marie Lelay (Cécile de France), who nearly died in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, is convinced she has seen a metaphysical reality the world is determined to ignore. “Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “What does seem new — newly strange, newly beautiful — is what ‘Hereafter’ makes of the here and now. It is a curious movie in both senses of the word: an unusual experience and an open-ended inquiry into something nobody can really claim to understand. It leaves you wondering, which may be the most fitting way of saying that it’s wonderful.”"

Wilder’s delicate, profound work follows the story of an American family over 90 years through periodic visits to Christmas dinners at the household table. Wilder, an astute music lover, readily adapted his play into a libretto for Hindemith, cutting the text considerably and providing some new rhymed lyrics for extended vocal pieces. Though well received, Hindemith’s opera, completed in 1961, has become a rarity. The conductor Leon Botstein came to the rescue in 2014 when he conducted a fine cast and the American Symphony Orchestra in a beguiling staged production at Alice Tully Hall. (This fascinating program preceded the opera with a performance of the Wilder play by a strong cast of actors, using the same set.) Bridge Records has now released a live recording of the performance. We hear the highs and lows of the Bayard family discussed over Christmas dinners, starting from the first at the family’s new house, when the matriarchal Mother Bayard beams as her son, who runs the family firm, slices turkey alongside his cheerful wife. Cousins come and go; children are born and have children of their own; one son dies in war; a child dies in infancy; an unmarried cousin comes to live; social mores and customs change. It’s a special opera, and this performance sounds as good as I remembered it to be. (Anthony Tommasini)"

Who Runs the Streets of New Orleans?,2015-07-30,article,News,,"['Police', 'Crime and Criminals', 'Mobile Applications']",How a rich entrepreneur persuaded the city to let him create his own high-tech police force.,"On the morning of Sunday, March 29, Sidney Torres was sipping an espresso in the kitchen of his mansion on the edge of the French Quarter when a jarring notification lit up his iPad and two iPhones. Pimps fighting with drug dealers and johns. Man has gun. Hurry. The message came from a neighbor 10 blocks away, on St. Louis Street, and was sent through a venture Torres started four days earlier: a private police patrol that could be summoned via mobile app. Torres, who made a vast fortune as the founder of SDT Waste & Debris Services, a sanitation company that cleaned up much of New Orleans in the years following Hurricane Katrina, spent $380,000 to fund the enterprise after a crime wave put Quarter residents on edge for the better part of a year. Between November and January, there were more than 60 robberies in the neighborhood, and the crimes became increasingly brazen, including a vicious stabbing and a spate of random beatings. It became a personal issue for Torres on Dec. 17, when his 8,000-square-foot home was burglarized; three weeks later, the bar next door was held up by two masked gunmen. Torres’s crowdsourcing approach to crime, conceived throughout February and March, was the impulsive byproduct of his belief that the New Orleans Police Department, which has shrunk by around 500 officers since Hurricane Katrina, was no longer able to protect even the neighborhood less than a square mile in size that contained the city’s most valuable real estate."

What’s On TV Friday,2015-07-31,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9 P.M.

Mark Ruffalo plays Mark’s brother, Dave, himself a gifted wrestler, who is disinclined to join the crusade. Vanessa Redgrave is John’s disapproving mother, who finds the sport beneath the family’s station. “Beautifully acted and impeccably mounted, it is light on historical details and heavy on atmosphere, character and chintz,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this drama, which earned Oscar nominations for Mr. Carell, Mr. Ruffalo and Mr. Miller; its screenwriters, E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman; and Bill Corso and Dennis Liddiard, the men behind Mr. Carell’s large prosthetic nose. “Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the brothers, including an early one in which they train in their old gym, hitting and grasping in a pantomime of aggression and affection, the crowns of their heads touching like the antlers of young stags testing each other,” Mr. Scott added. “It’s rare to see such physical male intimacy on screen, especially among men not bonded by war. And it’s in the depictions of this intimacy, in its tangle of bodies and desires — the images of John squirming on top of and below other men say more than any of his pitiful speeches — that ‘Foxcatcher’ rises to the occasion of real tragedy.”"

Caught up in the mass hysteria, I too bought a copy.

Inside the List,2015-07-31,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"William Finnegan, who has written several sober examinations of the world’s hot spots, has his first best seller with the surfing memoir “Barbarian Days,” No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list.","The Waves: As a war reporter and international correspondent for The New Yorker, William Finnegan has long been celebrated for his sober examinations of the world’s hot spots — going back to 1986, all of his books have been “editors’ choice” picks in the Book Review, including dispatches from apartheid-era South Africa, civil-war-torn Mozambique and poverty-stricken America. None of those books became best sellers. But his latest, the surfing memoir “Barbarian Days,” ends Finnegan’s dry spell at last, landing on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 5. “I was kind of nervous about coming out of the closet as a surfer,” Finnegan told The National Post in Canada last month. “I mean, I was a political reporter and writing a lot of political opinion pieces for The New Yorker, and I had a kind of reluctance to expose this part of my life and have a bunch of people say, ‘What do you know? You’re just a dumb surfer.’ ” Once he started, though, he couldn’t stop. “It’s easy for me to write about the act of surfing. I find it endlessly interesting,” he said. “The trick is to make it interesting to readers who couldn’t care less.” This columnist might be the kind of reader he means — I’m not a surfer, dumb or otherwise, although friends in California once coaxed me onto a board for 20 seconds. But I do kayak, and I recognize the giddy obsession Finnegan brings to his sport. In that sense, “Barbarian Days” offers the same heedless pleasure as any addiction memoir before the reckoning; it is, as Alice Gregory writes in The New York Review of Books, “an utterly convincing study in the joy of treating seriously an unserious thing.”"

The minimalist décor — layered cedar wood and painted burlap — muffles the sound to allow conversation amid the vegetable-rich small plates. On Tuesday night, the 37 seats filled up and stayed full. No one seemed to be stalking the rock star partner."

Review: ‘Dapline!’ Demonstrates Gesture as Communication and Dance,2015-07-31,article,Review,,['Dancing'],This dance by Renegade Performance Group had no accompanying music: The sound came from the contact of hands and feet.,"“Dapping” could be defined as elaborate handshaking, but that would only begin to describe this kind of greeting, developed by and still largely associated with African-American men. Yes, hands clasp and shake, but they also slide and slap and snap. Something between a punch and an embrace, dapping is communication through touch, a dialect direct in its wordlessness but still rich in emotional nuance and gestural beauty — like dance. All of these facets are illuminated by “Dapline!,” a powerful dance that Renegade Performance Group debuted on Thursday in University Settlement’s Speyer Hall on the Lower East Side. Choreographed by André M. Zachery with the artist LaMont Hamilton, this work for six men has no sound accompaniment but is hardly silent. Skin hits skin. Feet and fists pound the floor."
