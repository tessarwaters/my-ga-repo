Add to that her four-decade career writing brilliant and often despairing novels about the black experience in America, and it’s no wonder interviewers frequently want her to proclaim about race relations or the latest tragedy playing out on the nation’s television screens. Morrison — whose new novel, “God Help the Child,” hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 5 — sometimes obliges them. “People keep saying, ‘We need to have a conversation about race,’ ” she told The Telegraph last month. “This is the conversation. I want to see a cop shoot a white unarmed teenager in the back. And I want to see a white man convicted for raping a black woman. Then when you ask me, ‘Is it over?,’ I will say yes.” (Almost 20 years ago, I heard Morrison read from an early draft of her novel “Paradise,” and when an audience member asked if the gains of the civil rights movement might herald an imminent end to racism, Morrison paused and slowly shook her head. “I am not optimistic,” she said.) But there is a less foreboding, more playful side to Morrison as well: The critic John Leonard once reported that she liked to chat with Fran Lebowitz about Court TV, and she told The Telegraph that Marlon Brando used to call just to recite her work: “I still have his number in my iPhone! How could I erase that?”"

Emerging from an emergency session of the Council, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, said Yemen was running out of food and medicine and sharply suggested that the United States, which supports the bombings, is responsible for their humanitarian consequences.

In a statement, an American official said Washington supported the idea of a humanitarian pause and was working with its Saudi allies to facilitate the delivery of aid. "

Premiering exclusively on T, the trailer for the film “Troublemakers” reveals an intersecting group of artists in the late ’60s and early ’70s, united equally by their communion with the elements and their anti-authoritarian attitudes. Often shirtless and shot in grainy black-and-white footage, some of which has never before been shown, the literal groundbreakers profiled — such as Michael Heizer, Walter de Maria and Robert Smithson — do little to undercut their mythologies as “difficult or headstrong or rebellious,” Crump says. But “troublemaking can also mean instigation or stirring up the waters, and it implies critique,” he adds, noting that land art emerged at the same time Americans were confronting images of bombed-out landscapes from the Vietnam War and of the cratered surface of the moon. “There was an urgency to make the work,” Crump says — even if the artworks, like the open vistas that animated them, defied collecting as “an investable asset class.”"

In 1964, she was one of just a handful of women in Yale’s M.F.A. program; but rather than let the boys intimidate her, she befriended them. When pals like the playwrights John Guare and Kenneth Brown secreted her into the men’s room so she could see the graffiti there, she treated the experiences as material, and based her first major series of works — Vietnam War protest paintings emblazoned with lewd language — on them. In the decades since, her work has been unapologetically feminist, sexual, sometimes profane, often vividly colorful — and incontestably influential for generations of younger female artists. In the final stages of preparation for “Voyeur,” a new solo show, the exuberant artist invited T into her Chinatown studio."

Currently on display at Danziger Gallery, the photo collages emerged from his paintings of nudes that he deemed not up to par. “I had a lot in storage and I thought, ‘What do I do with these?'” he says. “So, I started to add abstractions, like ‘little Calders,’ and each turned out to be a better painting” — and to play with censorship, plenty of which Perez has encountered on Instagram. (“You have no idea how many posts of mine have been taken down because they don’t meet the community standards,” he says.) He then decided to pull pictures of women from their social media accounts and apply the same principle, both an organic extension of his practice and a response to the age of digital sharing. “And,” Perez continues, “I like covering certain parts because people’s imaginations complete the job.”"

As the ringleader of a crew of dirty cops stationed at the 75th Precinct in East New York, he padded his income by stealing money, guns and drugs from dealers. He eventually graduated to working for drug rings, one of which put him on retainer so he could provide information about narcotic operations. “The Seven Five” has been called “the cop version of ‘GoodFellas,’ ” which may explain why Sony has plans to produce a fictional remake. Here’s hoping that version uses a better moral compass. "

The dudes in these movies tend to observe a ritualistic narrative proximity (they get close, but not too close) that’s echoed in the physical protocols of the typical bro-hug. In these familiar ceremonial interactions, the bros lean in toward each other for some upper-body contact even as they simultaneously maintain scrupulous, observable genital distance.

Shirley Jackson’s ‘Life Among the Savages’ and ‘Raising Demons’ Reissued,2015-05-08,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",Two reissued memoirs showcase Shirley Jackson’s lighter side.,"When “Life Among the Savages,” a collection of warm and funny magazine pieces chronicling the ups and downs of Shirley Jackson’s household, was first published in 1953, Jackson was already a well-known writer — of a rather different kind. She had made headlines five years earlier with “The Lottery,” which attracted attention not only for its shocking content, but also for the vehemence of the response it provoked. Many were unsure whether this tale of ritual stoning in an American village was fact or fiction; some railed at The New Yorker for printing such barbarism; others just wanted to know what on earth it meant. Jackson, who had already published the novel “The Road Through the Wall” (1948), about murder and suicide in a small California town, sealed her macabre reputation with her next two books: “The Lottery” (1949), a collection of often suspenseful short stories, and “Hangsaman” (1951), a coming-of-age novel about a college student who suffers a mental breakdown."

Phillips was born on the island of St. Kitts in 1958, but as an infant he left with his parents during the mass migration of people from the Caribbean islands — still colonial subjects ­­— to Britain in the 1950s. Immigration has been a key topic in Phillips’s work from his very first novel, “The Final Passage” (1985). His first two novels were fairly straightforward in style and structure, but with his third, “Higher Ground” (1989), Phillips introduced the more ambitious and unconventional approach he has used ever since. Rather than tell one linear story, these later novels bring together several independent narratives set at different places on the globe and at different moments in time. The stories are linked by theme and situation as opposed to setting and plot. "

Walter Dean Myers’s 1988 novel “Fallen Angels” explored the costs borne by American soldiers sent to Vietnam with little knowledge about where they were and less about why they were there. The book deglorified war, exposing the sharp irony of sending young men, not yet old enough to vote and often marginalized by race or socioeconomic status, to defend ideals of democracy.

This installment takes the characters from 1953 through 1986, introducing a new generation and letting them contend with milestones like the Vietnam War, Jim Jones’s seductive Peoples Temple and the early days of the AIDS crisis. In some hands the conceit could have felt gimmicky or forced, a kissing cousin to “Forrest Gump” or Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” But reviewers so far have been largely impressed, comparing Smiley to the giants of 19th-century literature. (“America’s Tolstoy,” ruled Christobel Kent in The Guardian.) Smiley also keeps an eye on her forebears, if more humbly. “Trollope would sneer,” she told one interviewer last year, after announcing she was about done with the trilogy’s 1,300 pages. In the same profile, she remembered with approval the motivational note — “Nobody asked you to write this novel” — that a former classmate kept taped to her typewriter. “What we do as writers is voluntary, so don’t complain,” Smiley said, recalling how inspired she was by an exhibit of hand-­corrected page proofs at the Balzac museum in Paris. “It’s good to see what it meant to be a popular author in the middle of the 19th century,” she said. “When you see how hard Balzac worked, you’ll never complain again.”"

Rooney Mara, above, in an Oscar-nominated performance, is Lisbeth Salander, the vulnerable yet ruthlessly competent computer hacker who helps him solve the mystery. “She is a marvelous pop-culture character, stranger and more complex than the average superhero and more intriguing than the usual boy wizards and vampire brides,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It has been her fate, unfortunately, to make her furious, uninspiring way through a series of plodding and ungainly stories.” And “despite the slick intensity of Mr. Fincher’s style, his movie is not immune to the same lumbering proceduralism,” Mr. Scott said.

Ryan Coogler’s feature directorial debut reconstructs the final 24 hours in the life of Mr. Grant (played by Michael B. Jordan, above with Ariana Neal) who, after two stints in prison, had returned to selling drugs after losing his job at a supermarket because of chronic lateness. Octavia Spencer plays his mother and Melonie Diaz the mother of his daughter, with whom he’s trying to stay. Mr. Coogler’s “main intention — and his great achievement, as well as Mr. Jordan’s — is to make Oscar a fully human presence, to pay him the respect of acknowledging his complexities and contradictions,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The radicalism of ‘Fruitvale Station’ lies precisely here, in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol. Nearly every black man, whether or not he is president, tends to be flattened out by popular culture and the psychopathology of everyday American life, rendered as an innocent victim, a noble warrior or a menace to society. There is a dehumanizing violence in this habit, a willed, toxic blindness that ‘Fruitvale Station’ at once exposes and resists.”"

What’s On TV Tuesday,2015-05-12,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"4:10 P.M. (Cinemax) THE PLAYER (1992) In this Oscar-nominated movie by Robert Altman, Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), who manages production at a Hollywood studio, tries to figure out who is writing him poison-pen postcards while he fends off a young genius (Peter Gallagher) rumored to be his replacement. When the author of the hate mail — a screenwriter (Vincent D’Onofrio) Griffin failed to get back to — turns up dead, Griffin becomes a suspect, partly for having fallen in love with the writer’s girlfriend (Greta Scacchi, above with Mr. Robbins). Whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Lovett play the detectives who make Griffin squirm. “As a satire, ‘The Player’ tickles,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “It doesn’t draw blood.” Mr. Altman’s most subversive message, he added, “is not that it’s possible to get away with murder in Hollywood, but that the most grievous sin, in Hollywood terms anyway, is to make a film that flops.”"

Studying the trend he’d seen in the previous few years, Moore predicted that every year we’d double the number of transistors that could fit on a single chip of silicon so you’d get twice as much computing power for only slightly more money. When that came true, in 1975, he modified his prediction to a doubling roughly every two years. “Moore’s Law” has essentially held up ever since — and, despite the skeptics, keeps chugging along, making it probably the most remarkable example ever of sustained exponential growth of a technology."

What’s on TV Thursday,2015-05-14,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9:40 A.M. (TMC) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Mr. Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric; Emmanuelle Seigner is Céline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josée Croze is a speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. “The phrase ‘triumph of the human spirit’ hovers over ‘The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,’ along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind” — among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration — Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) “Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual,” he added, noting that Mr. Schnabel demonstrated this with “imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.”"

The cheery young Dutchman, who sees himself “as a sculptor, mainly,” has stirred lots of attention for his “Nimbus” series of atmospheric creations, in which he plays weatherman and creates clouds indoors. For centuries, humans have tried to control the atmosphere, and Smilde, who is “not particularly scientific — I have a Lego background,” he says, has managed to hack nature. “Moisture is the main factor, and if it’s cold, that really helps,” he explains. “Other than that, I’m using all kinds of means to create an image and idea.” Mostly, that entails fog machines and squirt bottles filled with water — and “shutting down the fire alarms,” he laughs, “otherwise everybody will get very wet!”"

Neither film was given much chance of earning a prize, but each in its way had considerable power. In the case of the Egyptian film ‘‘El Haram’’ (The Sin), it was a virtuoso performance by Fatem Hamama as a farm worker falsely accused of murdering an unwanted child. The Bulgarian entry, ‘‘Gorechto Plande’’ (Torrid Summer), gave a touching account of a community’s efforts to rescue a boy whose hand has got stuck in a hole in a bridge. — New York Herald Tribune, European edition, May 15, 1965"

What’s on TV Friday,2015-05-15,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"11:45 P.M. (Starz Cinema) FOR NO GOOD REASON (2014) “I really thought what I would do, if I ever learned to draw properly, was I would try to change the world,” the British artist Ralph Steadman explains in Charlie Paul’s documentary about him. So in 1970, Mr. Steadman jetted to New York, where he planned to take a thousand photographs that would inspire the illustrations he couldn’t seem to get quite right. “There was an arrogance missing, there was a wildness missing, there was a rawness missing,” he says of that early work. “It lacked that bite I needed, that real ferocious bite, the thing that would make it noticeable.” Then he received instructions to meet Hunter S. Thompson, not long after his infiltration of the Hells Angels. The weekend became a vicious, drunken nightmare, and he and Thompson went to pieces. Thus, gonzo journalism — in which the writer (and in this decadent collaboration, the illustrator) becomes the story — was born. What would Thompson’s “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” be without Mr. Steadman’s ink-speckled and splotched drawings, Mr. Steadman argues. “There is a formal discipline and thematic coherence to Mr. Steadman’s images that his friend’s writing sometimes lacked,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Steadman has frequently aimed to shock, and almost always with good reason.”"

Haruki Murakami’s ‘Strange Library’ and ‘Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage’,2015-05-15,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Audiobooks']","Two novels offer a deadpan mix of comedy, menace and the just plain odd.","What’s so beguiling about Haruki Murakami? It’s a question asked by admirers and detractors alike. As with few other authors, the charms of Murakami’s books are difficult to pin down, so completely and gracefully does his work slip past the usual benchmarks of enjoyable literature. His plots are full of interesting incidents, but they build slowly, or not at all, or in a way that’s completely off kilter, rather than following any real discernible arc. Regular readers of Murakami will find him reusing his favorite devices — cats, missing girls, obscure works of music — making them less startling and/or more enduring, depending on one’s point of view. Structurally, his work appears to proceed by instinct rather than by strategy; his use of the third person in “1Q84,” for instance, feels exactly like his vast, samey array of first-person narrators. Murakami’s work brushes up against some grand themes but doesn’t quite tackle them; his best novel, “The Wind‑Up Bird Chronicle,” explores the horrors of World War II, but nobody would describe the book as making a major statement about war. As for his language — well, most of us New York Times readers are receiving Murakami in translation, but even so there’s little to indicate we’re missing some grand linguistics in the original. His language is accessible, plain-spoken, even banal, perhaps purposefully so."

Toward an Oral Art,2015-05-15,article,Review,,"['Poetry and Poets', 'Audiobooks', 'Books and Literature']",Shouldn’t it be easier to listen to poetry?,"“I love it when you read to me,” Stephin Merritt croons in “The Book of Love,” that mainstay of moderately alternative bride-and-groom dances.

But until relatively recently, the car and the kitchen weren’t standard venues for listening to a story, poem or novel. That has changed with the well-documented rise of the audiobook, a format in which, as The New York Times has previously noted, publishers “released nearly 36,000 titles in 2013, up from 6,200 in 2010, according to the Audio Publishers Association.” The Wall Street Journal calls audiobooks a “rare bright spot” in the publishing industry, and pins the total market for them at well over a billion dollars."

The subject is vast and — you wince at the thought — it’s only “Volume 1.” Since this first installment has been 40 years on the way, the older reader’s chances of getting to the end aren’t guaranteed.

"‘The Dig,’ a Novel by Cynan Jones",2015-05-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The fates of two men — a badger baiter and a grieving sheep farmer — converge in rural Wales.,"The first word we hear in Cynan Jones’s intense and remarkably compressed third novel, “The Dig,” is “bitch.” It is said of a dead badger sow on the road, as an unnamed man tries to cover up the evidence that she had been tethered during an illegal fight with dogs. “Then he ground his foot down on the leg,” Jones writes, “and stamped over and over, smashing the thin precise line of the wire out of the raw flesh.” The echo of that violent exclamation resonates throughout this powerful book. We move between two strands — one the unnamed badger baiter known as “the big man” and the other, Daniel, a Welsh farmer grieving for his recently dead wife and trying to keep her memory alive as well as their lambs. Thus the novel becomes a kind of diptych about violence, loss and the different ways one can be trapped."
‘After the Tall Timber’ Collects Renata Adler’s Nonfiction,2015-05-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Over three decades of Renata Adler’s essays, criticism and long-form journalism. ","In the first essay in this new collection of nonfiction, Renata Adler writes about the cultural role of her generation. Adler was born in 1938, coming of age after the heroism of World War II and before the antics of baby boomers. “In college, under Eisenhower, we were known for nothing, or for our apathy,” she wrote in 1969. “We are unnoticed even as we spread clear across what people call, without taking account of us, the generation gap.” Neither here nor there, she went on to explain, “we cut across,” and in this function her generation found its purpose: “At a moment of polarization, and other clichés that drain the language of meaning, the continuity of the American story seems to rest just now in us.”"
"‘Odysseus Abroad,’ by Amit Chaudhuri",2015-05-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Strolling in London with his uncle offers a student an escape from loneliness.,"The title of Amit Chaudhuri’s sixth novel may use the Greek form of the ancient hero’s name, but the predecessor he’s got in mind for this story of two Bengalis wandering around London isn’t so much the “Odyssey” as it is “Ulysses.” Still, both Homer and Joyce begin the same way: with a young and callow man setting out in search of an absent father. Call him Telemachus, call him Stephen Dedalus. Or call him Ananda Sen, who in 1985 is studying English literature in Britain’s capital and making a bad thing of it. He wants to be a poet, he likes Ted Hughes and Philip Larkin, and he has begun to learn that Shakespeare’s language isn’t so much universal as rooted in English particulars. In a country with India’s weather, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day” sounds like an “insult”; in England, it’s a compliment."

A New Dance by Rebecca Patek at Chocolate Factory,2015-05-15,article,News,,['Dancing'],"In her latest work, Ms. Patek, who often takes on disturbing subjects, mixes her family history with material from the famous murder trial.","The title of Rebecca Patek’s new performance piece is a mouthful: “The Future Was Looking Better in the Past: My Family Herstory: or from religious persecution to american greed to murderous infamy to denial, repression and the slow dissolution into moral confusion, financial ruin and karmic retribution.” In the work, Ms. Patek, a choreographer and performance artist who often confronts disturbing subject matter — her last show involved rape — explores facets of violence, both buried within herself and out in the world. In her premiere, presented by the Chocolate Factory and Abrons Arts Center, she finds inspiration in the vicious 1924 murder of Bobby Franks by Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb. Performed by John Hoobyar, Sam Roeck and Chris Tyler, the work blends material from the murder trial, Patek’s family history and her own imagination: Who were Leopold and Loeb? What were their psychological complexities? What leads to acts of horror? For Ms. Patek, armed with a wry, twisted sense of humor, the answers float somewhere in the subconscious. "

Dan Pope’s second ­novel, “Housebreaking,” embraces this clash: “All the white houses and green lawns,” one character muses, “the children’s toys lying unattended in driveways.

The book (written with Benjy Eisen) opens with an anecdote from the late 1980s, when the band finally broke through to mainstream success: Its only Top 40 hit, “Touch of Grey,” reached No. 9 on the Billboard chart; the video was in constant rotation on MTV; and the band sold out a five-night run at Madison Square Garden. The attention, Kreutzmann acknowledges, was a little overwhelming. “We decided to celebrate by getting as far away from it all as possible,” he writes, explaining how he and Jerry Garcia, the singer and lead guitarist, ended up scuba diving in Hawaii one day with their roadie Steve Parish. “It was as psychedelic and far-out as anything we had seen during the Acid Tests, or at Woodstock, or during our strange days wandering around San Francisco during the Summer of Love. And yet, we were sober for this one. After years of persistent pot smoking, psychedelic excesses, alcohol benders, cocaine binges and heroin abuse, scuba diving was going to be our new drug.” It was, eventually — Kreutzmann and Garcia dived together many times over the years, as the rest of the book makes clear. But that first trip didn’t take them as far from fame as they had hoped: Underwater, a scuba instructor swam up to Garcia with a waterproof notepad and asked for his autograph. “Twenty feet below the surface!” Kreutzmann writes. “I nearly spat out my regulator from laughing so hard.”"

"Review: ‘Don Quixote’ Ballet Unites Lovers, Dryads and Toreadors",2015-05-15,article,Review,,['Dancing'],The Gelsey Kirkland Ballet has mounted this full-length 19th-century story ballet with a cast of 100.,"Don Quixote, viewing the world through the lens of his fantasies, mistakes a windmill for a giant and has visions of what isn’t actually there. But during the vision scene of “Don Quixote,” which Gelsey Kirkland Ballet presented at the Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University on Thursday, the ranks of classically trained dancers that crowded onto the stage were real. Mounting a full-length 19th-century story ballet with a cast of 100 might have seemed a quixotic goal for a troupe only two years old, but this one already has a “Nutcracker” and a “Sleeping Beauty” under its belt. “Don Quixote” is less a leap than a sensible next step.

Frieze New York’s Big Red Riding Hoods,2015-05-15,article,News,,"['Art', 'Frieze Art Fair']",A recurring motif at this year’s fair is the depiction of crimson cloaks.,"After combing through thousands of works of art culled from multiple time zones on view at Frieze New York this weekend, you might ask yourself, where does the May 2015 contemporary art zeitgeist converge? The answer to this question is irreducibly clear: on marsala-colored cloaks! Is it a Pantone conspiracy that the design authority’s official color of the year has been tracked not once but three times on Randall’s Island — in cape form? At the booth of the Bogotá gallery Instituto de visión, a scroll of wine-colored fabric terminating in a poncho is emblazoned with the words “PIA FOR SALE,” advertising a performative action by the Mexican artist Pia Camil. Meanwhile, a not dissimilar garment has been committed to canvas by the Brazilian artist Edoardo Berliner at the booth held by the São Paulo gallery Casa Triângulo. Titled “Sapatos” (“Shoes”), the headless, matadoresque draping calls attention to the glossy black footwear beneath it. Perhaps the most striking of maroon gowns on display, however, is the chromed sculpture at Parisian dealer Jocelyn Wolff’s stand. As part of an elegant solo presentation by the French artist Guillame Leblon, this merlot mantle without a wearer is an homage to Giacometti that triggers a theme consistent throughout Leblon’s work, the spectral absence of the body. Enjoy these fine reds!"

There is much open space in these performances, much insight and mystery, a settling into a zone between direction and indirection. Apart from Mr. Shorter’s stature as a small-group composer in jazz — the best, pretty much — the alert and unscripted way the quartet operates has for many listeners represented a current ideal for how jazz works and what it can contain: immediacy, collectivity, discipline, freedom."

We begin with an anomaly: an ancient farming community in northwest India where locals and leopards have lived in peaceful harmony for hundreds of years. The novelist Hari Kunzru sets up camp to experience the potentially precarious phenomenon firsthand. In Joshua Tree, we visit a far-out house, designed by the visionary architect Kendrick Bangs Kellogg, that is nearly as awe-inspiring as the landscape itself. We also stop by one of the world’s great inns — La Colombe d’Or in Provence — where a century’s worth of famous artists toting their own works have helped create an environment that is as much a world-class gallery as it is a hotel. And because summer is coming, we sent the photographer Karim Sadli to Hawaii, where he shot the model Julia Bergshoeff in the season’s best bikini bottoms and lightweight knits. Elsewhere, female artists in their 80s and 90s get their long-awaited due; the finance journalist Felix Salmon shines a light on conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where the parties are usurping the panels for all-important networking (and Spring Break-style fun); Jody Rosen cracks the spine on street lit, the hard-boiled, sexed-up book genre whose greatest practitioners may just be the most successful literary couple in America; and tattoos, which have grown increasingly idiosyncratic in recent years, leave their mark on the minds (and bodies) of the creative world’s most stylish.

1915: New Portuguese Premier Shot On Reaching Lisbon,2015-05-17,article,News,,"['Assassinations and Attempted Assassinations', 'Politics and Government']",From the International Herald Tribune archives: The new Portuguese prime minister is shot in Lisbon.,"LONDON — Just when peace and calm had apparently been restored in Portugal, a grave event has occurred that will probably  have a disastrous effect on the situation. A telegram from Lisbon received this evening [May 17] states that Senhor Chagas, the new Prime Minister, was shot at and seriously wounded by Senator João José de Freitas. Senhor Chagas had just arrived at the Entroncamento railway station, coming from Oporto to take possession of  the Premiership. A large gathering was on the platform to meet him, and while shaking hands with and receiving the congratulations of his friends, Senhor Freitas broke through and fired several revolver shots at the new Premier. A struggle ensued and gendarmes fired on the assassin who was killed on the spot. Senhor Chagas was taken to hospital in a dying condition. It is feared, as  a result of this tragedy, that the trouble may recommence. There are already signs of a fresh outbreak. — The New York Herald, European Edition, May 18, 1915Correction: June 4, 2015An article in the “In Our Pages” column on May 18, recalling the shooting of the Portuguese primes minister in 1915, misspelled the name of the senator who shot Senhor Chagas.

So were all-encompassing drones, hip-hop tracks that had been sped up or melted down, thoroughly warped glimmers of pop and the sounds of barking dogs and breaking glass.

What’s on TV Monday,2015-05-18,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"4:15 P.M. (Starz Cinema) LOVE IS STRANGE (2014) Alfred Molina and John Lithgow (above right, with Mr. Molina) portray Ben and George, a couple for 39 years who are forced to live apart after their marriage results in the loss of George’s job at a Roman Catholic school and a mortgage they can no longer afford. So Ben moves into the Brooklyn apartment of his nephew (Darren Burrows), his nephew’s wife (Marisa Tomei) and their son (Charlie Tahan). And George takes a spot on the living room couch of his former neighbors (Cheyenne Jackson and Manny Perez), two New York City police officers. Awkwardness ensues. The film’s director, Ira Sachs, “is an especially careful student of the odd rhythms and quiet intensities of couplehood, both gay and straight,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Lithgow and Mr. Molina, seasoned and subtle actors, beautifully capture the small pleasures and petty irritations Ben and George live through, and also their pride at having survived, together, for so long.” Mr. Sachs, he added, “casts an occasional discreet glance backward at the post-Stonewall history of gay men in New York, a complicated chronicle of tragedy, resilience, struggle and fun. But that history nonetheless feels implicit in every frame, infusing what might otherwise be a touching anecdote about real estate troubles and houseguest etiquette with gravity and grace.”"

Myers Jr. in October, a shooting that renewed tensions with law enforcement weeks after Michael Brown was killed by an officer in nearby Ferguson. In a report released Monday, Jennifer M. Joyce, the circuit attorney for St. Louis, found that Mr. Myers “produced a gun” during the encounter with the officer, Jason Flanery, who was working an off-duty security detail for a private company. Police had said Mr. Myers, 18, who was black, shot a stolen handgun before Officer Flanery, who is white, returned fire.

"‘Man in Profile: Joseph Mitchell of The New Yorker,’ by Thomas Kunkel",2015-05-19,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",A biography of Joseph Mitchell attempts to explain one of literary history’s “greatest disappearing acts.”,"In his salad days as an uncommonly dapper reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and The World-Telegram, Joseph Mitchell wrote about celebrities, crimes and the quotidian disasters of city life during the Depression: He covered the Lindbergh kidnapping trial (“a mess”), witnessed the electrocution of six men, and watched a woman who had been stabbed in the neck bleed to death while he tried to make her lie still. He might have gone on like that and had a productive if ultimately forgettable career, were it not for a newspaper series he wrote on the anthropologist Franz Boas that became, for Mitchell, “a kind of graduate-level seminar”: “Don’t take anything for granted,” Boas told him, among other things. The advice helped transform Mitchell from a competent beat reporter with a graceful prose style into, arguably, our greatest literary journalist — a man who wrote about freaks, barkeeps, street preachers, grandiose hobos and other singular specimens of humanity with compassion and deep, hard-earned understanding, and above all with a novelist’s eyes and ears. “When the New Journalists came ashore,” John McPhee observed, “Joe Mitchell was there on the beach to greet them.”"

My parents divorced when I was 4, and I was raised mostly by my black mom, in a black neighborhood of Philadelphia, during the Black Power movement.

The Ann Coulter Critique of American Christianity,2015-05-19,article,News,,"['Christians and Christianity', 'Evangelical Movement', 'Missionaries']",Should American churches be doing more domestic missionary work?,"My Sunday column discussed recent remarks from President Obama and the sociologist Robert Putnam on American churches and the fight against poverty, in which both men suggested that culture-war fixations have sidelined American Christianity’s mission to the poor. Given the sums raised and man-hours invested by religious groups in charitable work, this is not a particular compelling argument; in fact, it’s pretty dumb, as a number of writers had already pointed out by the time I got around to the subject. So I added my voice to their chorus, but I also tried to raise one possible way in which you could argue that the churches are failing poorer Americans: Not in their charitable works, but in the actual business of soul-winning itself, as evidenced by the fact that downscale Americans are both less likely than the affluent to attend church and less likely to attend, period, than in the recent past. And I noted that you don’t even have to believe in the soul to see this as a failure: Since the social benefits of religion seem to flow through participation and belonging, even from a purely secular perspective (well, if such a thing exists) America’s churches would probably be doing more for the poor than charity alone can offer if they were keeping more people in the pews."

Inside BarChef, his Modernist cocktail laboratory on Toronto’s Queen Street West, multisensory presentations evoke the flavors of the season — not just in the glass, but surrounding it, too. Solarik’s Spring Thaw is served in a cool, perfumed fog of cedar, lilac and grapefruit, billowing from a bed of wet moss that nestles a glass of vanilla Campari granita swimming in chamomile gin and sparkling wine. That drink’s a showstopper, wafting in all directions across the bar; a perennial Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan (the preference of the rappers Jay-Z and Drake) is more self-contained, infused tableside under one of two antique glass domes. If those drinks appear daunting to replicate, Solarik’s Canadian bestseller bar manual “The Bar Chef: A Modern Approach to Cocktails” ($30, Harper) is released today in the United States. And if the drinks recall the culinary artistry of Grant Achatz’s Alinea, it will come as no surprise that the Chicago chef penned the book’s foreword. “Grant came into BarChef in 2009 when we first opened, and his incorporation of aromatics and theater changed my life,” Solarik recalls of the research trip Achatz took prior to opening The Aviary."

They were exploring, even now, the way his songs are awash in clashing impulses: rebellion, isolation, anger, uncertainty, yearning, fear, lust, frustration, brawling, searching. Three of Mr. Townshend’s many self-questioning manifestos — “I Can’t Explain,” “The Seeker” and “Who Are You” — started a set full of the Who’s surefire material. "

CNBC Looks at Costs of Liars and Cheats,2015-05-22,article,News,,['Television'],“(Dis)Honesty: The Truth About Lies” mixes accounts of people who have been caught lying or cheating with studies on how widespread the practices are.,"Lying is a crucial element of lots of scripted TV — false-identity dramas like “Revenge,” for instance. It’s pivotal in some game shows, like GSN’s “Lie Detectors.” So why not a documentary? On Thursday at 10 p.m., CNBC obliges with “(Dis)Honesty: The Truth About Lies,” an illuminating look at the whys, hows and how-oftens of the ancient practice. The program juxtaposes stories of people who have lied — two men from an inside-trader scheme; a woman who used a website that facilitates adulterous hookups; an N.B.A. referee caught in a betting scandal, and more — with studies on the nuts and bolts of lying. That research has produced counterintuitive findings. The high-stakes liars who make headlines, for instance, might draw a disproportionate amount of scorn. “Yes, there are some big cheaters out there,” says Dan Ariely, a professor at Duke University, “but they are very rare, and because of that their overall economic impact is relatively low. On the other hand, we have a ton of little cheaters, and because there are so many of us, the economic impact of small cheating is actually incredibly, incredibly high.”"

The narration, recorded by the British actor Trevor Howard in 1985 from the original 1945 script, sounds very strange to 21st-century ears.

The bill, which is considered one of the most drastic in Britain’s long Parliamentary history, makes Prime Minister Winston Churchill a virtual dictator and grants his War cabinet absolute control over private property, industry, labor, the banks, and, more important still, the rights of the individual. The powers are extended for two years and apply equally to North Ireland. In a solemn House, Mr. Attlee gave the bill its second reading and emphasized the gravity of the hour with the declaration that ‘‘everything for which we stand is in jeopardy.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, May 23, 1940"

Inside the List,2015-05-22,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"Jessica Knoll’s novel “Luckiest Girl Alive,” which is No. 12 on the hardcover fiction list, is the latest best seller with a mean girl for a protagonist.","Mean Girls: A couple of years ago, when the subject of “likable” characters in fiction resurfaced courtesy of Claire Messud’s “The Woman Upstairs,” the debate touched not only on gender — nobody complains about bad boys, Messud noted — but on genre, with some commentators suggesting unlikable heroines are automatically seen as more “literary.” But of course pop fiction has long embraced difficult women: Consider Gillian Flynn’s “Gone Girl,” which blithely ruled the best-seller list even as the likability argument raged around it. Now there’s another mean girl in the clique: Ani FaNelli, the protagonist of Jessica Knoll’s “Luckiest Girl Alive,” new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 12. Ani writes a sex column for a women’s magazine and schemes to land a trophy husband; some reviewers have called her the mirror image of Amy Dunne in “Gone Girl,” since Ani seems purely manipulative at the start but becomes more human as the book reveals its secrets. Knoll, a former editor at Cosmopolitan and Self, told me there’s a feminist case to be made for unlikable women. “Men who are ruthless and aggressive in pursuit of their goals are acting within their culturally sanctioned bounds,” she said via email, “and we admire them for that. Women who do the same are punished because that hard-nosed behavior is counter to how we believe women should be, which is kind, nurturing and selfless. The knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss Ani as vain and vapid. But when we reward women for showing their full range of humanity, warts and all, when we give their struggles weight, we allow for the possibility that their flaws and stories can endear, inspire and move us, just like those of men.” A little spice is O.K., in other words, but please hold the sugar."

What it does is jammy, fuzzed-out and discursive, full of soul vocals and twin-guitar arrangements; it brings together elements of cumbia, bolero, vallenato and the Brazilian pop experimentalists of the late ’60s and early ’70s. The band members play in ruffled, powder-blue tuxedo shirts and deliver party music from top to bottom, with stylish attention to tube amps and analog warmth.

Her biggest cause, in which she enlisted every environmentalist, journalist and ordinary citizen she could buttonhole, was to restore the full meaning and scope of the 1972 Clean Water Act, whose protections, she believed, had been fatally weakened by the courts and by politicians in thrall to special interests — mainly developers, industrial and municipal polluters, and big farmers.

But across the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin County, the upright-walking chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his team have built their own civilization, complete with distinctive wooden architecture, domesticated horses, a sophisticated sign language and an education system overseen by the orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval). But when the humans ask to encroach on their territory to build a hydroelectric station, the alarms are sounded — and schisms formed. “It’s a satisfying movie and an example — a dispiritingly rare one these days — of what mainstream Hollywood filmmaking can still achieve,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Matt Reeves’s Oscar nominee for best achievement in visual effects. “That we have progressed from ‘Rise’ only as far as ‘Dawn’ suggests many future sequels, which may, in this case, be a source of hope as well as dread, provided that civilization doesn’t collapse in the meantime.”"

The contemporary refectory in the heart of the city’s under-resourced Greco neighborhood will host a coterie of Bottura’s most charitable colleagues, beginning with Eleven Madison Park’s Daniel Humm and former Chez Panise chef Seen Lippert, eager to make a feast of the exposition’s transported food waste for those most in need by performing culinary alchemy twice daily in a glass-enclosed stage. “At lunchtime, there are going to be students there; and the very best chefs in the world, the rock ‘n’ roll stars, will be cooking scraps for them,” says Bottura of the facility’s secondary mission. “It’s like the Pope washing the feet of the people in the street.” While Bottura’s inspiration for the project draws on local influences including the Italian cinematic fantasia “Miracle in Milan” and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper,” his greatest motivator has been Pope Francis, whose spontaneous utterance of “Buon pranzo!” (“Good lunch!”) five days into his papacy inspired a renewed sense of faith within the chef. “Introducing himself with those words reminds everyone to start each day with humility, and humility is the most important thing,” Bottura says, “because from there others are going to follow you.”"

Horror,2015-05-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The season’s horror books include Clive Barker’s “The Scarlet Gospels” and Andrew Pyper’s “The Damned.”,"Thank God for evil. Without it, horror fiction would be a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick or, perhaps, a ragged, bloody, roughly handled zombie action figure for gullible children. That, of course, is what contemporary horror actually is, most of the time. For some writers, though, the damned soul does sometimes clap its hands and sing. Clive Barker knows the tune, and in his new novel, THE SCARLET GOSPELS (St. Martin’s, $26.99), he belts it out as rapturously as an Irish tenor crooning “Danny Boy.” Better than half the action of “The Scarlet Gospels” takes place in hell, where Barker is clearly very much at home. His descriptions of the underworld often recall the grotesque tableaus of Hieronymus Bosch, but are at other times weirdly hushed and lyrical: “The sky contained neither sun, nor stars, which was predictable enough, but what it did contain was a stone the size of a small planet. The stone reached high above the immense landscape that spread out below, and it threw off fissures like lightning bolts, through which brightness poured. The effect upon the vast panorama was uncanny.” In Barker’s work, beauty and evil are an old married couple, living together comfortably, even serenely, with no secrets left from one another."

Or consider this story, one told to me 20 years ago by a member of the Rock Bottom Remainders, the writer-rock band. (Now that might be an oxymoron.) The band stopped for breakfast at a small-town truck stop before the sun was up. This was pre-smartphone, pre-social media, practically pre-Internet.

The police estimate that there are as many as 10,000 gang members in Stanislaus County, where Modesto is, most either Norteños and Sureños, two of California’s most notorious Latino street gangs.

National Gallery Buys George Caleb Bingham’s ‘The Jolly Flatboatmen’,2015-05-28,article,News,,['Art'],"The painting has hung in the museum for decades, but was privately owned.","In its pre-Instagram, pretelevision, all-but-pre-photography day, George Caleb Bingham’s “The Jolly Flatboatmen” (1846) was a viral image, a joyous genre painting of America’s westward expansion that became wildly popular through mezzotints and lithographs. The work itself, considered one of the most important American paintings of its kind, has hung in the National Gallery of Art in Washington for so many decades — regularly since 1956 — that it long ago came to seem like a part of the museum’s fabric. But the painting was privately owned, for many years by the Pell family and then by the Detroit collector Richard Manoogian, who bought it in 1986 for $6 million, at the time the most ever paid privately or at auction for an American painting. Now, the National Gallery has brought the boatmen fully into the fold, acquiring the painting from the Richard and Jane Manoogian Foundation for an undisclosed price."

Review: ‘Results’ Tracks Exertions in Matters of the Cardio,2015-05-28,article,Review,,['Movies'],"In Andrew Bujalski’s romantic comedy, a personal trainer and her boss find their badinage interrupted by an out-of-shape heir.","“Results” is something of a paradox: a straightforward movie that reveals itself by stealth and indirection. Tracing the awkward interactions of three Austin, Tex., residents — a personal trainer, her boss and an out-of-shape client — the film seems to wander amiably, almost aimlessly through daily routines and low-key surprises. Only toward the end do you realize that the characters have been arranged into a pleasing and familiar romantic-comedy triangle and that you’ve been watching a beautifully played game of underhand slow-pitch screwball.

Among the works in this “Great Performances” presentation, taped in September, are Wagner’s “Tannhäuser” overture, which Mr. Nelsons has credited with inspiring him at the age of 5 to pursue a life in music. “As he walked to the podium on Saturday he was greeted with a long, rousing ovation; many people were on their feet,” Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times in his review of that concert. “But the best indication that Mr. Nelsons was a strong choice for the job was the superb playing of the musicians of this great orchestra, especially in, of all things, Respighi’s familiar 1924 symphonic poem, ‘Pines of Rome.’ If you are going to conclude an important inaugural concert with a shameless showpiece, well, picking this skillfully written, dazzlingly orchestrated and colorful score was the way to go.

"‘Burning Down George Orwell’s House,’ by Andrew Ervin",2015-05-29,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this debut novel, a burnt-out advertising worker in Chicago moves to an isle in Scotland to refresh his soul.","In this debut novel, Andrew Ervin works familiar ground: the burnt-out protagonist who gives up a comfortable but spiritually toxic life in order to refresh his soul and seek redemption in a far-off — or, in current parlance, “off the grid” — place, which according to the formula will inevitably be populated by locals for whom the appropriate collective noun is “menagerie.” One approaches the scenario braced for cliché. But Ervin pulls it off, and then some. “Burning Down George Orwell’s House” is a sweet book full of delights. Since many of its best passages are rhapsodies on single malt whiskies, one is tempted to call it a wee bonny dram of a tale."

"‘The Brethren,’ by Robert Merle",2015-05-29,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"“The Brethren,"" published in France in 1977, is the first of 13 volumes detailing more than a century of French history and known as “Fortunes of France.”","Historical fiction plays a delicate trick, honoring the factual record even as it embroiders it. Where to adjust the register without straying beyond the fixed range? One of the many delights vouchsafed by Robert ­Merle’s “The Brethren” is the sense that the author is astonished that what he’s writing about actually happened — that 450 years ago France consisted of a batch of tenuously ­allied provinces, with Catholics and Protestants locked in holy and civil war; that 14-year-old ­nobles were joined in ­marriage; that kings died in jousting ­matches; that Gypsies haunted untamed forests; that castles were ­defended with blunderbusses and cutlasses. Where Merle teases this history is through his invented Huguenot family, headed by two Jeans, the exemplary Baron Jean de Siorac and his austere best friend, Jean de Sauveterre — the “brethren” of the novel’s title, united by war and joint masters of Mespech, a castle in ­southern Périgord."

"‘Daughters of the Samurai,’ by Janice P. Nimura",2015-05-29,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The daughters of samurai families were “volunteered” for a decade of study abroad.,"For college students today, junior year is considered the optimal occasion for study abroad, a time when they have “transitioned” from the comforts of home, declared a major and acquired a smattering of a foreign language. For three Japanese girls in 1871 — Sutematsu Yamakawa, age 11; Shige Nagai, 10; and Ume Tsuda, 6 — study abroad began much earlier and lasted for 10 long years. They were transformed in the process, as was the country they left behind. “Though they were, each of them, purebred daughters of the samurai,” Janice P. Nimura remarks in this beautifully written book, “they became hybrid by nurture,” at home neither in their adopted country nor in their homeland."

Handy titillated the nation with “Beale Street Blues,” his song about a true-life Sodom and Gomorrah in downtown Memphis. “If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk,” he wrote, “married men would have to take their beds and walk.” Fats Waller, Lena Horne and the former Beale resident Alberta Hunter all went on to sing it, but probably few people today know about that post-Civil War nirvana for liberated slaves. On Beale Street, freedom ran raucously, dangerously amok. Races cohabited and brothels thrived; heated games of dice-rolling often ended with the flash of switchblades. Cocaine was sold over the counter. The anarchy was set to a soundtrack of early jazz, much of it provided by Handy, the bandleader and composer of “St. Louis Blues.”"

The writer and artist first got noticed for a teenage superhero series, “Zot!” (1984-91), then broke through with “Understanding Comics” (1993), an exegesis, in comics form, of comics form. McCloud drew himself as a friendly, bespectacled guide, demonstrating why “cartoony,” stylized faces (as in “Peanuts”) help us identify with characters; and how comics can tell many sorts of stories, whether or not there are superpowers or family traumas involved. “Reinventing Comics” (2000) predicted broad uses for digital platforms; “Making Comics” (2006) showed potential creators how to use the pen-and-ink and electronic tools we have."

Inside the List,2015-05-29,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Dan Santat was stunned when his picture book “The Adventures of Beekle” won the Caldecott Medal in February: “I crumpled to the floor and started crying.”,"Feeling Lucky: To anybody who’s known a toddler, it might seem counterintuitive that the children’s picture book list at the moment is so stable and calm — seven of this week’s 10 entries have been on the list for six months or longer. (In some cases much longer: Hervé Tullet’s “Press Here” is coming up on four years.) That means that Dan Santat’s sweet story “The Adventures of Beekle,” about an imaginary friend in search of his human, is a relative newcomer: It’s No. 7 after 13 weeks. Santat’s book got a bump when it won the Caldecott Medal in February, setting it apart as last year’s “most distinguished American picture book.” The award caught Santat off guard, he told Publishers Weekly at the time. “I never really thought that I had a chance,” he said. “When I got the call, I hate to admit it, but I started crying. I crumpled to the floor and started crying.” Santat has illustrated other people’s books for a long time (he previously hit the list as the illustrator for Ahmet Zappa’s “Because I’m Your Dad,” in 2013), but “The Adventures of Beekle” is just the second story he’s written on his own. He almost chose not to, he told Publishers Weekly: Five years ago he had a chance to join Google, drawing doodles for the home page. “Should I take this job and make money to support my family,” he asked himself, “or should I chase my dream?” Turning Google down, he continued, “motivated me to use the other side of my creative brain, to write more.” It paid off. Among the highlights of Santat’s February, according to his Tumblr account, was outselling “50 Shades of Grey” (“for a brief moment”) and receiving the following Valentine’s “newsletter” from his 9-year-old son, Alek: “Dan Santat has just won his amazing Caldecott award. Many people think that Dan is known around the world.”"

He collaborated with the foundation on the master plan for its sprawling outpost in Beacon, N.Y., shaping even the parking lot.

The installation represents the return of “Excursus” to public view almost 17 years after its premiere at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea, where it became a kind of touchstone of Mr. Irwin’s working methods.

"Review: ‘The Sleeping Beauty,’ Reawakened by American Ballet Theater",2015-05-31,article,Review,,['Dancing'],Alexei Ratmansky’s production is the climactic event of American Ballet Theater’s 75th-anniversary season.,"The ballet of “The Sleeping Beauty” — new in St. Petersburg in 1890 — addresses tradition, renewal and diverse aspects of dance theater.

Its classicism showed, as Stravinsky wrote in his “An Autobiography,” “the triumph of rule over the arbitrary” and “the perfect expression of the Apollonian principle.”"
