(“Frankenstein” author Mary Shelley is said to have been inspired by golem as well, although she never said so herself.) The mild-mannered scientist Bruce Banner turns into a raging behemoth as the Incredible Hulk, an echo of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Some heroes have powers that are outright demonic in nature, from Etrigan the Demon to the flaming-skull cyclist, Ghost Rider. “Blade,” the 1998 film about a vampiric hunter of the undead was the key precursor to the modern era of superheroic pop-culture hegemony."

Charles Masson, one of the city’s rare guardians of classic French cuisine and service, will run the restaurant.

It celebrates British cinema of the late 1950s and ’60s, not least the era’s kitchen-sink dramas. Such movies introduced the likes of the directors Karel Reisz, John Schlesinger and Tony Richardson, whose unflinching focus on the urban working class, depicted with a dignity and honesty, has fresh relevance amid contemporary America’s economic chasm. Friday has the singular “A Taste of Honey” (1961), from Shelagh Delaney’s pungent 1958 play. Jo (Rita Tushingham, a 19-year-old newcomer then) is encumbered by her slattern mother (Dora Bryan). When Jo’s romance with a sailor results in pregnancy, a gay textile designer (Murray Melvin) helps out. Shot by the cinematographer Walter Lassally, often in the smokestack-laden precincts of Greater Manchester, “Honey” could inspire 1,000 album covers for the Smiths. It runs with Richardson’s “The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner” (1962). (filmforum.org)"

Celebrating New York’s Pioneer of Preservation,2017-03-21,article,News,,['Documentary Films and Programs'],A new documentary from Matt Tyrnauer explores Jane Jacobs’s urban activism.,"A year after what would have been her 100th birthday, Jane Jacobs is as relevant as ever. This September marked the publication of “Eyes on the Street,” Robert Kanigel’s biography of the urban activist, and next month, the director Matt Tyrnauer (“Valentino: The Last Emperor”) joins the conversation with the wide release of “Citizen Jane: Battle for the City,” a documentary that establishes Jacobs as a forerunner of today’s ground-up social movements. Through never-before-seen footage and interviews with her friends and admirers, the film revisits Jacobs’s midcentury battle with New York City planner Robert Moses. Where Moses privileged governmental power (and his own), Jacobs favored preservation and the natural order of neighborhood life. In perhaps her greatest victory, she and her followers protested — singing a song Bob Dylan co-wrote for the cause — and ultimately halted Moses’s proposed construction of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have cut through SoHo and Little Italy and altered New York as we know it."

A two-level restaurant serving Mexican food in a shiny new office building is hardly cookie-cutter Midtown, but Mr. Stupak is counting on his approach to the cuisine, filled unapologetically with American and other influences — he makes no claim to authenticity — appealing to the Midtown set. “Everyone told me that I had to have a shrimp cocktail in Midtown,” he said. “I didn’t think so.” Instead, his freewheeling menu offers starters like crab nachos with sea urchin, chopped cabbage salad with toasted dried fava bean dressing, and nine different tacos, including a falafel one and another with spit-roasted beef that is a take on al pastor. “We’re using tacos as a gateway drug to get people to try other stuff,” he said. Some larger plates, including roasted red prawns with chipotle, and fajitas with black pepper mole, round out the choices. The design for the 150-seat space, by Glen Coben in collaboration with Mr. Stupak, is airy and bright, with a big bar area and a more intimate dining room and open kitchen beyond. Upstairs, there are tables on the overhanging balcony and several private rooms. All are adorned with Mexican art pieces.

Not just because you likely haven’t heard of it, but because there isn’t anywhere to stay. But it now comes highly recommended by locals for its growing food scene and small-town vibes despite steady gentrification. It’s home to more than a few hipster and creative types, and on one quiet corner sits a charming restaurant to rival any Brooklyn eatery: Wm. Mulherin’s Sons, which gets its name from the 19th-century whisky bottling and blending company that once occupied the space. Nearly every ingredient on its menu is made in-house, right down to the flour blends for the homemade pizza crusts. (Bon Appétit named it one of the 50 best restaurants to open in 2016.) And now, you can sleep upstairs — in one of the four chic rooms Wm. Mulherin’s Sons just opened as a hotel. They’re uniquely designed (and stocked with things like Kinfolk magazine and Aesop toiletries), and perfectly sized for longer stays (with full kitchens and even washing machines). The rooms are conveniently located above Wm. Mulherin’s Sons (for nightcaps) and around the corner from the La Colombe flagship (for morning coffee.) The most exciting part of your stay might just be checking in: Like at any old seaside pub, keys are simply doled out by anyone working the bar, so you can grab a pint before heading up to your room.

"As Baseball Considers Change, It Should Look to Its Past",2017-03-28,article,News,,['Baseball'],"In the game’s infancy, different leagues played by different rules — and that cacophony encouraged creativity.","In 1857, 14 baseball clubs met at Smith’s Hotel on Broome Street in Manhattan to draft a new set of rules and regulations. In an effort to make the game more manly and scientific, members of the Knickerbocker Club, New York’s most influential team, proposed that “the ball must weigh not less than 6 nor more than 6¼ ounces avoirdupois” and that “no person shall be permitted to approach or to speak with the referee, umpires or players, or in any manner to interrupt or interfere during the progress of the game.” Most significant was the rule that changed the terms of victory. The winner was no longer the first team to score 21 runs, but the one that accrued the most runs after the end of nine innings. The reasoning behind the change was simple and logical: Fielding, which had been a stone-handed disaster during baseball’s earliest days, had improved rapidly, making it hard for any one team to reach 21 before the sun went down. The modern nine-inning game was one of the first official attempts to make baseball games go faster."

5 Brands Creating Streetwear for Women,2017-03-28,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Women and Girls']","From a line consisting entirely of leather to one from a Supreme vet, a handful of emerging names to know. ","The brothers Jacob and Axel Hagg moved to Los Angeles from New York in 2012 — and a year later, they launched their brand, Brashy Studios. “There was and is a creative opportunity in creating a new women’s streetwear line not present in the men’s market,” says Jacob, who first moved from Stockholm to New York to intern for a creative agency before decamping to the West Coast. The brothers draw inspiration from the deep corners of the internet — as well as from people they find on Instagram, like the musical artist Tommy Genesis, an underground female rapper known for her rebellious attitude and lyrics. Though Brashy is geared toward female customers, some pieces in the collection — such as oversize hoodies, boxy jackets and roomy trousers — are intentionally gender-fluid. “For us, streetwear should incorporate something of an anti-establishment ethos; establishment can of course be freely interpreted,” Jacob says. The brand’s spring/summer 2017 collection — which is available now at Colette in Paris and on the Brashy Studios website — consists of a fluorescent-pink vinyl jacket and pants, a tearaway tracksuit and pieces emblazoned with the word “GIRLS.” "
