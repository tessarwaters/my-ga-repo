(TCM) BABY PEGGY, THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM (2012) Peggy-Jean Montgomery, left, a daughter of a professional cowboy turned stuntman who moved his family to Hollywood, was 19 months old when she captured the attention of the director Fred Fishbach. Impressed by her plucky demeanor and good behavior, he cast her in some of Century Studios’ comedy shorts, sometimes opposite Brownie the Wonder Dog. As the third great child star of the silent era, after Baby Marie and Jackie Coogan, Peggy made about 150 shorts in all, working eight-hour days, six days a week, and performing stunts like being held underwater and escaping a burning building. In 1923 she earned the nickname Million-Dollar Baby when Universal lured her away from Century with the chance to make feature films for $1.5 million annually. But soon her father and the producer Sol Lesser argued about her salary, and Lesser not only fired her but also blackballed her in Hollywood. By the age of 11 Baby Peggy was a has-been. When she reached adulthood, she discovered that her family had spent her earnings — more than $2 million. Calling herself Diana Serra Cary, Peggy became an author and film historian as well as an advocate for laws protecting child actors. This tribute begins with Vera Iwerebor’s documentary, filmed shortly before the actress’s 90th birthday in 2008. It is followed by “Captain January” (1924), a silent feature about a lighthouse keeper (Hobart Bosworth) who raises a child found washed ashore in a ship’s wreckage, at 9; and three of her few remaining shorts: “Carmen, Jr.” (1923), a spoof on Bizet’s “Carmen” and the tango, at 10:15; “Such Is Life” (1924), loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen’s “Little Match Girl,” at 10:30; and “Peg o’ the Mounted” (1924), about a pint-size Mountie who hunts down a gang of moonshiners, led by a giant of a man played by Jack Earle, who stood roughly 7 feet 7 inches."

Mars Rover Finds No Signs of Life in Dirt,2012-12-04,article,Brief,,"['Mars (Planet)', 'Space', 'Curiosity (Mars Rover)']","NASA said Monday that its Mars rover Curiosity had analyzed a Martian sand drift, but — alas — had not found signs of the building blocks of life.","NASA said Monday that its Mars rover Curiosity had analyzed a Martian sand drift, but — alas — had not found signs of the building blocks of life. At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, scientists said the mineralogical composition was similar to what was found by the earlier Spirit and Opportunity rovers elsewhere on Mars. An instrument, Sample Analysis at Mars, or Sam for short, looked at the gases that escaped as it heated the dirt to nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The most common gases were water vapor and carbon dioxide. The Sam instrument also detected chlorinated methane — a small, simple compound that falls in the category of organics, which are the building blocks of life. But the scientists said it was too early to say that the soil itself contained organics. The carbon could be vestiges of molecules that the spacecraft brought from Earth, and the organics could have been generated by chemical reactions as the dirt was heated. Whether the carbon could point to anything biological, “that’s well down the road for us to get to,” said John P. Grotzinger, the mission’s project scientist. "

The spacecraft, which is more than 11 billion miles from Earth, has entered a “magnetic highway,” a new region of crisscrossing charged particles, some from the Sun and some from interstellar space. But researchers, speaking at a news briefing in Pasadena, Calif., said there was no indication of a change in the magnetic field that would indicate that Voyager had entered interstellar space itself. Edward Stone, a Voyager project scientist, said this new region may be the last layer before interstellar space, but it could take the spacecraft another two or three years to cross it. Voyager 1 is traveling about 11 miles a second; a companion craft, Voyager 2, is not quite as far from the Sun and is traveling slower, less than 10 miles a second. "

(Sundance) THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY (2001) Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, above, wrote, directed and starred in this drama about a Los Angeles couple’s sixth-anniversary party, and official reunion after a separation, which runs amok. She, Sally, is a 30-something movie star who may soon be washed up; he, Joe, is a British writer whose novel about their troubled marriage is about to be made into a film. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the $4-million-a-movie actress who is supposed to play a character based on Sally and brings along a batch of Ecstasy to the festivities. Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates, Jane Adams, John C. Reilly, John Benjamin Hickey and Parker Posey fill out the cast. “An articulate, acutely observant film like ‘The Anniversary Party’ makes you realize how starved Hollywood movies are for great ensemble acting,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “In probing its characters’ souls, ‘The Anniversary Party’ goes only so far. This isn’t Chekhov, by any stretch of the imagination. The empathy the film extends to its characters may be evenly distributed, but it isn’t all-embracing. Yet despite its shortcomings, this smart, caustic movie is easily the most incisive and realistic comedy of manners to emerge from Hollywood in quite a while, and that’s saying a lot.” "

(Cinemax) WANDERLUST (2012) Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, above, star as Linda and George, out-of-work Manhattanites unable to sell their “microloft” in the West Village. They stumble onto Elysium, an “intentional community” in rural Georgia, where good vibrations — and not a little smoke — fill the air, and the only blackberries grow on trees. Established decades earlier by Carvin (Alan Alda), now in a wheelchair and battling memory loss, and his hippie friends, the commune is home to a touchy-feely, guitar-strumming collage led by Seth (Justin Theroux), a creepy Lothario. The group includes another New York dropout (Malin Akerman) and a novelist and nudist (Joe Lo Truglio) who wears the occasional sanitary pouch (like a hairnet, but lower) when he’s crushing grapes for homemade wine. “Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this “mostly funny comedy” from David Wain. “Linda and George don’t burn with the yearning to travel that the title suggests, yet like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back, they want off the road, at least for a while. There’s something touching about this desire, though Mr. Wain doesn’t let Linda and George fly their freak flags for long.” Instead, she said, “the filmmakers prefer penis jokes and, with Mr. Lo Truglio and Mr. Rudd’s help, they provide plenty. Ms. Aniston and the other women (including Michaela Watkins as a desperate housewife) try to keep up, but ‘Bridesmaids’ notwithstanding, the women’s liberation movement in comedy has yet to arrive on the big screen.” "

It’s as colorful as the flock of parrots that inexplicably flies through Millet’s suburbs. Amid all the misery, a certain innate good nature — and a desire to survive — shine through. A three-legged dog that stumps through the novel could serve as a mascot for Millet’s grim but grinning vision: tail wagging, the maimed dog just keeps on keepin’ on."

Unnatural Disaster,2012-12-07,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Famine']","The Chinese famine of the mid-20th century is a monument to Maoist tyranny, a journalist argues.","In the summer of 1962, China’s president, Liu Shaoqi, warned Mao Zedong that “history will record the role you and I played in the starvation of so many people, and the cannibalism will also be memorialized!” Liu had visited Hunan, his home province as well as Mao’s, where almost a million people died of hunger. Some of the survivors had eaten dead bodies or had killed and eaten their comrades. In “Tombstone,” an eye-­opening study of the worst famine in history, Yang Jisheng concludes that 36 million Chinese starved to death in the years between 1958 and 1962, while 40 million others failed to be born, which means that “China’s total population loss during the Great Famine then comes to 76 million.”"

Marshall, the United States Army’s steely chief of staff during World War II, was ruthless in relieving subordinates who didn’t measure up to his exacting standards. Between the time he assumed office in September 1939 and America’s entry into the war on Dec. 8, 1941, he cashiered at least 600 officers — and he wasn’t done yet. Numerous others, including generals, would lose their jobs when they didn’t perform well enough in the caldron of combat. As the veteran military correspondent Thomas E. Ricks notes in his new book, “The Generals,” “Sixteen Army division commanders were relieved for cause, out of a total of 155 officers who commanded Army divisions in combat during the war. At least five corps commanders also were relieved for cause.”"

You were mad for their music: a mash-up of crooning vocals, atmospheric synthesizers, blistering electric guitar and a driving, dance-or-die backbeat. You were hooked on their videos: slick mini-features depicting the band in glamorous settings with exotic vixens. You worshiped their fashion sense: natty, rainbow-colored suits accessorized with rakish fedoras and jazz shoes. But above all, you were desperately, passionately enamored of one of the band’s five members: Simon, Nick, John, Roger, Andy. Like the Beatles before them, these handsome bearers of British pop were a generation’s heartthrobs; wherever their jazz shoes touched (planet) earth, hysteria inevitably followed. "

An inattentive step or two and already we have traveled too far. The door has disappeared. Our place in the world has become irrecoverable. The past half-decade of American letters has seen the translation or publication of a little pack of kindred novels intended to reproduce this sensation, nearly all of them fascinating. Call it the literature of the ontological wrong turn.

Good design was hailed as a solution to consumer inertia: “The appeal of efficiency alone is nearly ended,” the adman Earnest Elmo Calkins wrote in a 1927 essay, “Beauty the New Business Tool.” “Beauty is the natural and logical next step.” He advocated a practice called “styling the goods” or style “engineering,” making familiar products look new, and desirable. A generation of designers working in architecture, advertising, packaging, interior design, graphic and scenic design came to believe that commonplace goods and appliances, from automobiles to pencil sharpeners, could benefit from contemporary veneers — and some serious retooling. This philosophy underscored the advent of a new field of industrial designers, the white knights of American industry."

What’s On Saturday,2012-12-08,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Showtime) WAR HORSE (2011) Steven Spielberg’s sweeping adaptation of the popular stage spectacle follows Joey, a fleet-footed headstrong half-thoroughbred who has formed an unbreakable bond with a strapping lad, Albert (Jeremy Irvine, above), on his parents’ tenant farm in England. Across the English Channel, on the battlefields and in the trenches of Flanders and France, Joey and Albert endure parallel experiences, including harrowing escapes, the loss of friends, terror and deprivation. Peter Mullan and Emily Watson play Albert’s parents, and David Thewlis is their landlord in this story written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, based on the novel by Michael Morpurgo. “Like most movies with an antiwar message, ‘War Horse’ cannot help but be enthralled by the epic scale and transformative power of military conflict,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “  ‘The war has taken everything from everyone’ — the truth of this reckoning, uttered more than once by characters on screen, is self-evident, but it is complicated by the visceral charge and cathartic relief that an effective war movie gives to its audience.” Still, “The extreme violence of the slaughter in World War I is implied rather than graphically depicted,” he added. “Mr. Spielberg steps back from the bloody, chaotic naturalism of ‘Saving Private Ryan’ — this is an animal fable for children, after all, with echoes of ‘E. T.’ and Carroll Ballard’s ‘Black Stallion’ — but his ability to infuse action sequences with emotional gravity has hardly diminished.” "

As politicians left and right try to hammer out a plan to keep the country afloat, the Parthenon still crowns the Acropolis like, in the words of an ancient Turkish traveler, “some impregnable fortress not made by human agency.” And if there is more commotion in Syntagma Square than usual, overall Athens is noisily going about being Athens — cafes are full, night life is roaring and at a recent concert by the singer Anna Vissi fans were flinging 10-euro trays of carnations at the star by the hundreds.

Simplifying the Fiscal Cliff Debate,2012-12-13,article,News,,[],Why the inevitability of an $800 billion tax hike makes a bigger compromise unlikely.,"There are a lot of potential moving parts in the fiscal cliff negotiations, and thus a lot of potential ways that matters could be negotiated and settled, postponed or left half-resolved. But sometimes simplification helps, and the best place to start when thinking about how things are likely to play out is with the following brute fact: No matter what Congressional Republicans offer the president and what they’re willing to concede, taxes on the wealthiest Americans are going to rise by at least $800 billion over the next decade. This is not a possibility, not a likely scenario, not a maybe or a might be; it’s just reality, conceded even by the notorious RINO Jim DeMint. Which means that it’s useful for analytic purposes to treat that $800 billion as a baseline, rather than as a live point of give and take in the negotiations, and recognize that any bigger deal John Boehner and Barack Obama are able to cut should be judged as much on how it balances spending cuts and tax increases beyond that baseline as on what it looks like overall."

She visits him soon after the story opens, dropping by the foster home where he lives and that, with its tidy lawn and swing set, looks pretty as a picture. It’s a snapshot of the American dream that seems out of her reach and that will bring her and the second girl trouble. "

Now the former spy thinks someone is out to kill her, which is why she’s buying a rifle and ammunition strong enough to take down a charging elephant. “We all have secrets,” she admonishes her disbelieving daughter. “No one even knows half the truth about someone else.” Rufus Sewell and Michael Gambon share the role of Lucas Romer, a spymaster and Sally’s former lover, who may be the only one who can save her. “Devout fans of the British espionage thriller or the British cozy mystery may find themselves perfectly happy with ‘Restless,’ ” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Boyd’s understated script is free of hackneyed dialogue or florid emotion (no surprise), and there are niceties of language — strategically repeated phrases, Ruth’s wavering forms of address to her mother — that you don’t expect in a mini-series.

At the Panel’s Edge,2012-12-14,article,Review,,"['Comic Books and Strips', 'Books and Literature']","In “Marbles,” Ellen Forney documents her struggles with bipolar disorder and her wobbly progress toward stability.","Ellen Forney’s greatest strength as a cartoonist is her gift for explanation — getting information across with vigor, wit and visual inventiveness. That inspiration may have come at an awful cost, she suggests in MARBLES: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo, and Me (Gotham, paper, $20), a memoir of her long tango, or wrestling match, with bipolar disorder. As she explains, her frantic, volatile high moods seemed to fuel her art; her crushing lows made it nearly impossible for her to make it, or do anything else; and the desperately inexact science of medication, she once feared, might rob her of the creativity she cherished. The bulk of “Marbles” documents her wobbly progress toward stability, with interpolated drawings from her journals and occasional side trips into the history of “crazy artists.” It’s not exactly focused, but it’s mostly delightful: Forney switches up the style and layout of her artwork every page or two, and she’s got enough perspective on herself to find some kind of comedy even in painful experiences."

Three years after Blitzstein’s death from what was evidently a gay-­bashing in Martinique in 1964, Cop­land said, “It is disheartening to realize how little the present generation knows who he was or what he accomplished,” and Leonard Bernstein expressed dismay in 1976 at “the rapidity with which his name’s been forgotten,” calling him “the greatest master of the setting of the American language to music.”"

The festive cocktail and dinner napkins, place mats and table runners are made from unprocessed linen hand-embroidered in India with folkloric motifs for a look that’s at once rustic and refined.

The proposed changes included a clause that suggested Instagram would share users’ data — like their favorite places, bands, restaurants and hobbies — with Facebook and its advertisers to direct ads more precisely.

Back From Madness,2012-12-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A journalist describes her remarkable recovery from a rare and mysterious illness.,"In the vast and growing literature of ­affliction there is essentially one ­story: how the writer and her loved ones made it through. From a literary point of view, everything depends on the sensibility of the narrator, her comportment both as the teller and as the main character in her own tale. The reader’s resistance to these stories can be strong. Severe illness, by its nature, narrows the focus; the palette of experience both intensifies and shrinks; we crawl into the bush, figuratively speaking, and wait out our fate, fighting to survive. There is little suspense: the existence of the memoir is testament to the fact that the author has lived to tell the tale. But what hard-won nugget of wisdom has she brought back from her brief descent into a hell that most of us, for now, have been lucky enough to avoid? Can she give her ordeal meaning beyond the brute fact of the thing itself? "

Fraternity of Men,2012-12-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"George Howe Colt looks at famous brothers throughout history, and reflects on how his own brothers have shaped his life.","The intricate challenge that brothers pose for each other, aptly characterized by the playwright Athol Fugard as a “blood knot,” is right up there with the most intense, frustrating, rewarding and self-defining of social bonds. If I speak from experience, having one brother, think how much more is George Howe Colt, with three — an older, Harry, and two younger, Ned and Mark — authorized to expatiate on the subject. Anyone who’s had the pleasure of reading Colt’s previous, National Book Award-­nominated work, “The Big House” (2003), will know his delicate, detailed, ironically self-­mocking way with prose, and his lucid, affectionate fair-­mindedness. That book dealt mainly with the generational fortunes of his Boston/Cape Cod WASP clan; the present one, “Brothers,” is more a meditation on himself and his contemporaries, seen through the fraternal lens."

Whitney examines America’s long relationship with guns.,"Despite the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., in July — to say nothing of “smaller” mass shootings elsewhere in the United States this year — the issue of gun control was conspicuously absent from the 2012 presidential campaign. It wasn’t until mid-October that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney felt compelled to address the problem of gun violence — and then only because an undecided voter asked them about it at the town-hall presidential debate. As Stephen Colbert joked afterward: “Now is not the time to discuss gun control. We haven’t had a mass shooting in almost 49 days.” A mere four days after Colbert’s quip, another mass shooting left three people dead and four injured at a Wisconsin day spa. Which, of course, did nothing to inject the issue of gun control into the presidential race."

I love the idea of taking back that easy, modern spirit that designers like Claire McCardell and Geoffrey Beene and Perry Ellis had.” Friends & Associates, named for what Edelstein considers the collaborative spirit of creative ventures, does just that, focusing on bright, polished pieces that make getting dressed in the morning a breeze. The resort collection, which is available beginning today on the Friends & Associates Web site, features lots of crisp cottons and an oversize polka dot print in what Edelstein calls “candy store” colors; spring offerings, pictured here, are a continuation of the same athletic-inspired theme with a buffalo check thrown into the mix."

As we are gathered here today, let us consider one of the most oddly faithful of all fiction writers, Fyodor Dostoevsky. More specifically, I’d like focus pretty intensely on what some consider to be the key moment in his greatest novel — arguably one of the greatest of all time — “The Brothers Karamazov.” (Elie himself notes the 1880 masterpiece as an example of the truly faith-engaged fiction of yore.) I speak in particular of the “Grand Inquisitor” scene, a sort of fiction within a fiction that draws on something powerful from the New Testament — Jesus’s refusal of Satan’s three temptations — and in doing so digs at the meaning of faith, freedom, happiness and the diabolic satisfaction of our desires.

A Kesha Reversal On ‘Die Young’ Lyrics,2012-12-23,article,Brief,,"['Newtown, Conn, Shooting (2012)', 'Music']",Program directors at pop stations in Connecticut and around the country took the song out of their rotations in the days after the Dec. 14 shootings.,"The Newtown, Conn., school shootings have had reverberations in the radio world, as lyrics that seemed within the bounds of good taste two weeks ago are suddenly hitting a flat note. A case in point is Kesha’s recent hit “Die Young,” a lightweight party tune about living for the moment. Though the theme of the song is carpe diem, it contains the chorus: “Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young/We’re gonna die young/We’re gonna die young.” Program directors at pop stations in Connecticut and around the country took the song out of their rotations in the days after the Dec. 14 shootings. Another song receiving very few spins these days is “Pumped Up Kicks,” last year’s Foster the People hit, which tells the story of a student shooting his classmates. The airplay for Kesha’s song dropped 19 percent on the Billboard Radio Songs chart this week, and the song has dipped to No. 4 from No. 3 on the Hot 100 single chart. Several program directors said the drop-off in airplay would be temporary, Billboard reported. In a string of Twitter posts last week, Kesha, below, apologized and asserted that she had objected to the lyrics but was “forced” to sing them. “I did NOT want to sing those lyrics and I was FORCED TO,” she wrote, in a post that was later taken down. She later posted a message on her Web site trying to clarify: “After such a tragic event I was feeling a lot of emotion and sadness when I said I was forced to sing some of the lyrics to ‘Die Young.’ Forced is not the right word. I did have some concerns about the phrase ‘die young’ in the chorus when we were writing the lyrics especially because so many of my fans are young and that’s one reason why I wrote so many versions of this song. But the point of the song is the importance of living every day to the fullest and staying young at heart, and these are things I truly believe.” Kesha is one of several songwriters on “Die Young.” The list includes Lukasz Gottwald (known as Dr. Luke), Benny Blanco, Cirkut and the group Fun.’s frontman, Nate Ruess."

Because these solos deal purely with steps and movements, with no evident characterization or narrative gesture, it’s easy to miss the ways in which they operate as drama. Alone, a Cunningham dancer investigates movement, space and time with a quality of contemplation that often turns dance into a stream-of-consciousness soliloquy. A dancer may return to a step like a default position or a habit of thought; may suddenly — and frequently — change direction and tempo as if changing the subject; may change position in midair as if meeting a challenge. The focus of the eyes plays a crucial role."

Bond Vigilantes and the Power of Three,2012-12-24,article,News,,[],No way to get us to the Greek outcome.,"Matthew Yglesias picks up on a point I’ve tried to make at some length recently: the popular story about how an attack by bond vigilantes can cause an interest rate spike and turn America into Greece, Greece I tell you, is incoherent. (Here’s a 2010 example from Alan Greenspan — the piece in which he declares it “regrettable” that the vigilantes haven’t yet attacked, but grudgingly concedes that low rates might persist “well into next year”, that is, into 2011. So what has he learned from the failure of his prophecy? Nothing, of course). It’s not just that there have so far been no signs of the bond vigilantes; it’s that even if for some reason the vigilantes did attack, it’s very hard to see how they could cause a recession in a country that retains its own currency and doesn’t have large amounts of debt denominated in foreign currency."

So-called Miniature chests, designed for Herman Miller by George Nelson, were introduced in 1954. The dainty pieces, which rest on aluminum bases, stayed in production until 1963 — a time when the company was abandoning residential furniture to focus on its office business. Miller has twice tried to revive the Japanese-inspired goods: once in 1994, when it reintroduced its home collection (they failed to sell), and again in 2005 (the chests were made in Asia, and the poor quality of the craftsmanship ultimately doomed the project). Bringing the chests back “is one of my favorite examples of doing the right thing,” said Ben Watson, creative director of Herman Miller, who is resurrecting a number of forgotten items from the company’s archives. This time around, the chests are made in the United States and have the same hand-fitted drawers as the originals. They are available in a wide range of solid woods with white or black metal pulls. The six-drawer chest is $2,809, the nine-drawer chest, $3,192; the optional base, $418. Information: hermanmiller.com/collection or (616) 654-3000. "

But how can her mother not feed her, when she and her husband feel that food is “made of love, and love . . . made of food”? How can these parents deny Edie life-giving nourishment when Edie’s father, a Jewish immigrant from Ukraine, nearly starved on his journey to Chicago and has never been able to get enough to eat since? Even though it’s clear that young Edie suffers under her own weight — she huffs and puffs up the stairs “like someone’s gassy old uncle after a meal” — her mother can’t refuse her the liverwurst and rye bread she loves. This is a Jewish mother after all, and those of us who’ve had one know that the message, when it comes to food, is always have a little more.

The rules, which come with much greater legal force than earlier regulations, require Internet users to provide their real names to service providers, while assigning Internet companies greater responsibility for monitoring what appears online. The government also included a mandate for businesses in China to be more cautious in gathering and protecting electronic data."

Crimes Without Punishment,2012-12-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"José Saramago’s first major novel, about several generations of a Portuguese family, has finally been translated into English.","It might seem surprising that only now — 14 years after José Saramago won the Nobel Prize in Literature and two years after his death — is this major novel, first published in Portugal in 1980, appearing in English translation. Then again, politically radical fiction is often a tough sell in our market. While Saramago was an outspoken member of his country’s Communist Party (“Marx was never so right as now,” he remarked at the outset of the recent global financial crisis), in his best-known work his politics are embedded in allegory or fantasy, allowing readers to view them as loosely humanist or to overlook them entirely. Not so with “Raised From the Ground.” Still, what’s apt to strike readers of this book is not so much that it’s radical but that it’s topical. “What kind of world,” it asks, “divides into those who make a profession of idleness and those who want work but can’t get it”? The novel even ends with descriptions of a kind of Occupy movement — though one with higher stakes — as peasants take over farm estates whose owners have relocated rather than pay their workers a living wage."

Coming of Age in Rochester,2012-12-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this debut novel, a group of friends in the late 1990s roam their dying city.","In his first novel, “Maverick Jetpants in the City of Quality,” the Rochester native Bill Peters depicts his hometown as a city in decay, haunted by past glories and racked by vandalism. The narrator, Nate, is about to turn 21. He lives with his mother and her current squeeze, “Fake Dad No. 3.” Mostly, he drifts and looks for work in a somewhat desultory fashion. His ambition, such as it is, is to join his best friend, Necro (né Andrea: “Everyone in Rochester is Italians”), at Kodak, the firm that made Rochester famous. But it’s 1999, and the prospects are bleak for old-fashioned companies like Kodak and for Rust Belt cities like Rochester, whose nickname hasn’t been “City of Quality” since the 1960s."
Stage Manager,2012-12-28,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Theater']","A biography of Thornton Wilder, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and novelist.","Writing in his memoirs, Tennessee Williams remembers paying a visit to Thornton Wilder after the New Haven opening of “A Streetcar Named Desire” (1947). Wilder — then at the height of his eminence, having won Pulitzers for both “Our Town” (1938) and “The Skin of Our Teeth” (1942) — dismissed Williams’s latest effort with the air of one “delivering a papal bull,” as Williams put it. A “lady” like Stella, Wilder declared, would never marry a “vulgarian” like Stanley Kowalski. “This character,” Williams reflected of his colleague at the time, “has never had a good lay.” With the perspicacity that would lead him to become, arguably, our greatest postwar playwright, Williams had pretty much hit the nail on the head."

We all sense that encircling the planet is — or was — quite a feat. But a feat of what, exactly? Today it’s possible to book a round-the-world air ticket simply by tapping a smartphone. After Magellan’s expedition did it the first time, one wonders if there’s any sense in recording all those who came after."
Soviet Dreams,2012-12-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An orphaned heroine is an emblem of 1930s Moscow.,"A superstitious tradition, meant to protect children from vengeful spirits, persists in Spanish-­speaking countries — naming babies for the opposite qualities that benevolent parents might be expected to wish upon their offspring. Parents who want their daughters to lead joyful lives might name them Dolores (“sorrows,” “pain”) or Soledad (“loneliness”). A boy might be called Tristán (“the sad one”). But Andrey Platonov, the beleaguered Soviet writer who died in 1951 of tuberculosis (contracted from his son, who had been infected in Stalin’s gulag), seems to have pursued the reverse strategy when, in the mid-1930s, he began work on an allegorical novella entitled “Happy Moscow,” to see whether it was “objectively impossible” to write a bona fide “Soviet” work of fiction."
Rogues’ Gallery,2012-12-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This novel’s heroine gets entangled in the world of art forgery.,"Isabella Stewart Gardner was decidedly eccentric. She walked lions, not dogs; drank beer, not sherry; and bathed opposite improving maxims rather than wallpaper patterns. (Some were more ominous than others: “Secret of two, secret of God; secret of three, secret of all.”) Such behavior made her reputation, though it was her magnificent art collection, assembled with the help of the young Bernard Berenson, that won her lasting fame. In 1903, Gardner opened her Venetian-style gallery — then called Fenway Court — to the city of Boston, enriching generations to come."

In their place we have just a smattering of Titian’s business correspondence and a few official statements. His friendship with the ferocious satirist and pornographer Pietro Aretino is the stuff of speculation. So too are his relations with the models and companions who appear in masterpieces like the “Venus of Urbino,” which transforms one of Venice’s highest-priced courtesans into a goddess of love, taunting us with her half-smile while resting her hand in a forbidden realm."
