It attracted scientists, the news industry and entertainers. It generated its own forms of commerce, wealth and celebrity and, for a while, inspired its own architecture, the luxurious movie palace. It was itself the focus of constant innovation, from the advent of sound, color and 3-D, to digitalization, which let smartphones and other devices incorporate both filmless cameras and small screens — hand-held movie palaces. And from the very beginning, creative people of all types grasped the cinema as an artistic outlet that would transform traditional storytelling and popular culture while giving a new focus to the international avant-garde. That group soon set about taking liberties with all aspects of the miracle: the camera, film and projector and the ways they could be manipulated to alter experiences of time, light, space and self."

A Very Good Shot.,2016-12-01,article,Review,,['Movies'],"In this Aleksey Mizgirev film set in 1860 St. Petersburg, an ex-nobleman makes his living as a proxy in honor matches of shooting skill.","The Russian-born author Vladimir Nabokov more than once complained about the conventions of depicting Russian duels in non-Russian works of art — noblemen with their backs turned to each other, walking 10 paces ahead, and so on. Not how it was done, the great writer insisted. “The Duelist,” a Russian-made picture about a former nobleman making his living as a proxy in honor-restoring matches of shooting skill, never shows such a duel. In this movie, directed by Aleksey Mizgirev and set in 1860 St. Petersburg, the fighters meet at close range, sometimes stand separated by a screen, and face off in other visually interesting ways. I still don’t think Nabokov would have approved — he had better taste in movies."

Here’s part of the biographical note from his latest novel, “The Spy,” new at No. 18 on the extended hardcover fiction list: “He has flirted with death, escaped madness, dallied with drugs, withstood torture, experimented with magic and alchemy, studied philosophy and religion, read voraciously, lost and recovered his faith, and experienced the pain and pleasure of love. In searching for his own place in the world, he has discovered answers for the challenges that everyone faces.” If this isn’t meant at least 50 percent in jest — again, it helps to append “in bed” to each item — then Coelho’s pharmacological dalliance may not be entirely a thing of the past."

The exhibition “Syria: A Living History,” at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, is here to remind us of that past. The show features just 48 objects, but it encompasses centuries, and much of the work is choice. The earliest piece, a stone sculpture that looks abstract except for two pairs of staring eyes, dates from around 3200 B.C. An exquisitely carved ivory lion’s head from the eighth or ninth century B.C. has roots in Near Eastern visual traditions shared with Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Christian, Jewish and Islamic influences also came into play and mingled. Throughout all of this, there were periods of murderous struggle. More remarkable, there were even longer stretches of multicultural peace. By closing with contemporary Syrian works, the show suggests that, against all present evidence, there could be peace again.

(It’s currently No. 14.) Abrams, who conceived and helped write the book, is taking some liberties here in the name of comedy — he actually identifies as secular despite his Jewish roots, and the participants really met not in a bar but in the Dalai Lama’s residence in Dharamsala, India, over the course of a week last year. But when the subject is joy, a little humor is allowed. “See if you can chuckle at your problem, at your shortcomings, at your frailties,” the book advises toward the end. “Even if it is a very grave or serious situation, there is often some humor that can be found. The human drama is often a comedy, and laughter is the saving grace.” (O.K., so those sentences are themselves strikingly earnest and humorless. But do as they say, not as they do.)"

It is not good (even Rollin nuts rate it low), but I checked it out again to see if there was some Christmas or holiday theme I’d missed before. No dice. There’s a brief winter battle scene, atrociously cut into a narrative that takes place largely when trees are in bloom, but that’s it."

The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,2016-12-30,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"John Grisham, whose “The Whistler” is No. 1 on the hardcover fiction list, says: “I still pull for the underdog. I still like the little guy.”","Star Power: This week’s lists reflect book sales for the period ending Dec. 24, which means you’ll find lots of famous novelists on the fiction side of the ledger: In publishing as in home electronics, brand names sell well for the holidays. They know it, too. Here’s John Grisham — whose thriller “The Whistler” remains No. 1 in its ninth week on the hardcover fiction list — describing his target audience in a November interview with Slate: “First of all, she’s female, because two-thirds of all books are bought by women. She’s going to buy it during the Christmas season, because 35 percent of all books are sold during the Christmas season. I would guess she’s probably going to be over 40, because they buy more books than under 40. And that kind of narrows it down. That’s probably my typical reader.” In the same interview, Grisham said he often writes from a sense of injustice about a given subject — don’t be surprised if he tackles student debt in a future thriller — and he gave vent, just a bit, to his political views. The short version: He doesn’t think much of Donald Trump. The slightly longer, more diplomatic version: “I still pull for the underdog. I still like the little guy, especially when the little guy is getting screwed by the big guy: the government, a corporation, an issue, whatever. . . . But you’ve got to be careful with your audience, because they don’t always share my politics. You can’t be intrusive with your politics in popular fiction, when you’re trying to entertain people. I really have to watch that, and I do watch it. I don’t feel a responsibility to write a book next year that might change something. My responsibility next year is to write a book that will entertain.”"
