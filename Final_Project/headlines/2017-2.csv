Westbrook’s pull-up is one of modern basketball’s most recognizable weapons — if not yet quite on the level of Kareem’s skyhook or Jordan’s turnaround or Dirk’s one-legged fadeaway, then at least at the edge of that territory. The move is a surprise attack. Westbrook is unreasonably fast and aggressive, a flying, screaming whirlwind of ferocious highlight dunks, and he charges the hoop with so much raging menace that defenders have no choice but to scramble backward to try to stop him. That’s when he hits them with the pull-up: He stops instantly and — while the defender’s momentum continues to drag him backward — leaps perfectly straight into the air, like a fighter pilot ejecting from his cockpit to escape an explosion, except that Russell Westbrook is the explosion: He is the explosion and the control all at once. The whole thing seems to defy the laws of motion. Growing up in Los Angeles, Westbrook practiced this move so many tens of thousands of times on the playground that he and his father referred to it as “the cotton shot,” because they always expected it to go through the net."

How to Walk on Hand Rails,2017-02-03,article,News,,['Parkour (Sport)'],Keep feet parallel to rail.

Make sure it’s sturdy and stable. Wear shoes with thin soles or go barefoot. “That gives you a more tactile feel and allows your feet to interact with the rail,” Graves says. Being on a rail is similar to being on a balance beam, but because the former is thinner and usually round, your whole foot cannot be on top of the rail at once. “That makes balance one of the biggest challenges,” Graves says."

While investigating genes for early-onset Alzheimer’s, we invented a gene-transfer method that stopped the brain damage and restored cognitive function. Eureka! Sadly, my doctor has just given me a diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer’s. Given that no truly effective treatment is out there yet, can I try dosing myself with our potential cure? Do I have the right, given that I will otherwise die of dementia before a clinical trial could even begin? I plan to do this alone. None of my people will know about it. It’s something like a high-altitude, low-opening jump. It is not reversible and may be dangerous. But is it wrong? Name Withheld"
Willie J. Parker Changed His Mind About Abortion,2017-02-08,article,News,,['ABORTION'],The Christian obstetrician on the “religious conversion” that led him to become an abortion provider.,"Your book, “Life’s Work,” is rooted in the fact that you have a moral and spiritual argument in favor of abortion rights, and you talk about your shift from someone who, for religious reasons, didn’t want to provide abortion to someone who, for religious reasons, did. Why did you consider that a “conversion”? I had to come to a crisis moment regarding a religious understanding that left me unable to help women when I felt deeply for their situation. So I needed to convert from a religious understanding that left me paralyzed to act on my deepest sense of connection to one that empowered me to do what I felt to be the right thing. It felt as life-altering for me to move from being unable to do abortions to being able to do them as it did to move from being a nonbeliever to becoming a believer."

Four New Magazines to Know,2017-02-08,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Magazines', 'Photography']","In an increasingly digital world, three new magazines are leading the charge of a renaissance in print.","If print is dead, nobody told Francesca Burns and Christopher Simmonds, whose new biannual magazine, PRINT, launched late last year. “For us, PRINT was always about a love of magazines, a love of image making; and a desire to create something beautiful, honest and optimistic without an agenda beyond that,” says Burns, a contributing editor for British Vogue who met Simmonds (previously the creative director of Dazed and Confused and now an art director for Gucci among others) working on advertising campaigns. The magazine launched in December at Dover Street Market and 10 Corso Como — and sold so quickly it became, according to Angela Hill of the bookseller IDEA, the fastest selling independent magazine launch in the history of their store. The first issue of the oversized magazine comes packaged in a cardboard box with posters, prints and badges. “We wanted to create something timeless, that people could come back to and rediscover,” Simmonds says. Inside are intimate portfolios from photographers and stylists like Jamie Hawkesworth, Colin Dodgson, Joe McKenna and David Sims — and there’s even a photo essay from the singer Frank Ocean. According to Burns, the brief to contributors was simple: “to do something personal — to do something that truly inspires the artist and to take time over it.” In fact, this is a mantra that Burns and Simmonds took to heart: They pushed the planned release date of the magazine back by a few months. “We could take our time, digest it, revisit it and add to it,” Simmonds says. “The only people we had to answer to were each other. We could do what we felt was right.”"

If the narrative begins in a room with those items, you’re more likely to be haunted by that space.” Material detail is powerful, because ghost stories are often about objects. “People become possessed by possessions,” Robbins says."

Should Athletes Stick to Sports?,2017-02-14,article,News,,"['Police Brutality, Misconduct and Shootings', 'Politics and Government']","How the current moment has changed the pressures on players, coaches and other to speak out or be silent.","For the past few months, the sports media has been embroiled in a fight over “stick to sports.” The phrase comes from a common online rebuke directed at sportswriters and pundits and players and coaches and anyone in the world of sports, really, who takes a political stance on anything that doesn’t occur on a field or a court or in a locker room or front office. The dividing line is predictable: Many jocks and traditionalists argue for a separation of church and state; many young fans say that sports, just like everything else, is politics. But as the sports media critic Bryan Curtis has pointed out in The Ringer, the debate is mostly moot now: Trump’s presidency, with its daily explosions, has made it impossible to cover pro sports, even in the simplest box-score ways, without detouring onto the White House lawn. This comes, in part, from the way basic sports coverage works. Reporters ask questions before and after every game, and when the only thing anyone wants to talk about is Trump, some of those questions will be about the president."

The year 2016 was the hottest ever recorded, surpassing the previous record in 2015, which had in turn exceeded that of the previous hottest year ever recorded, 2014. Just as the world seemed poised to embark on a collective effort to wean itself off dependency on fossil fuels, its leading power elected as president a man who has claimed that global warming is a conspiracy invented by the Chinese and who went on to select as his secretary of state the chairman of Exxon Mobil.

(The book makes its debut on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 12.)

There was a start-up atmosphere, so everyone got to do a bit of everything. And the fund manager just sort of took a liking to me. She told me: ‘Look, your boyfriend is a filmmaker. One of you should make some money. I’m giving you an opportunity to learn the business and make some dough to keep living in New York City.’ So I took a crash course in financial analysis and investing. It was like learning a new language.”"

Patients are in treatment for their own needs and should not be required to consider the therapist’s other actual or prospective patients. (Psychotherapy isn’t a simple commercial transaction.)

Its “shoulder” was mounted to a waist-high pedestal on wheels. If it were to hail someone across the room, its “elbow” would reach eye level. Below its “wrist,” which was triple-jointed for extra dexterity, there were sockets for various attachments. McGillivray, not sure yet if he wanted to keep the contraption, stuck a piece of clear tape to the wrist and drew a happy face on it, which made the arm look a bit as if it were putting on a puppet show.

"George Saunders, Famous for Futuristic Short Stories, Hits No. 1 With a Historical Novel",2017-02-24,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"“Lincoln in the Bardo,” about the president mourning his young son, goes straight to the top of the hardcover fiction list.","Mourning in America: Could Joe Biden have been the next Abraham Lincoln? That thought came to mind recently thanks to George Saunders’s debut novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo” (new at No. 1 in hardcover fiction), which centers on Lincoln’s sorrow over the death of his young son. Biden, you may remember, opted not to run for president shortly after his son Beau died of cancer in 2015 — a wrenching and understandable decision, of course, but one cast in retrospective relief by the suggestion in Saunders’s novel that private grief made Lincoln a better public servant. “What moved me about Lincoln’s arc during his presidency,” Saunders told me via email, “was the way that the burdens of the office — the floundering war effort, intense public criticism, the mistakes he made that were costing so many lives, the death of his son — beat him down and made him sorrowful, but also, almost causally, seemed to expand the reach of his empathy, so that, by the end, it included soldiers on both sides and the millions of Americans being enslaved by other Americans. It seemed to me that the empathy was somehow a byproduct of the sorrow — a burning-away of his hopes and dreams that resulted in a kind of naked seeing of things as they really were. For me, the book was about that terrible conundrum: We seem to be born to love, but everything we love comes to an end. What do we do with that? How can we keep going and live positive lives under that shadow? I came to understand Lincoln as someone so beat down by sadness and loss that he developed a sort of crazy wisdom — as if, in sadness, all of the comforting bromides that normally keep us from the harsher truths were denied him. Empathy might even thrive best in this state, where the easy comforts are denied us. Conversely, empathy doesn’t do well in a climate of fear or anxiety, when one forgets the particular and individual and, in a panic, begins theorizing about whole groups of people without knowing many of them.”"
