It is regarded as fortunate to have a French test case, since there are no issues between France and the United States, while there are issues between Great Britain and the United States. Germany misses an opportunity of twisting the Lion’s tail over this incident.’’ The feeling among the public is that this is the only satisfactory outcome possible of the Dacia case, in view of the extremely friendly feelings which exist between this country and France. On every side I hear admiration expressed of the extreme wisdom shown by the French nation in resisting the temptation to imitate Germany and some of the neutrals in sending propagandists here to meddle in American international affairs, since the public sentiment here is still fighting capably for the Allies. — The New York Herald, European Edition, March 2, 1915"

This November, the “Parks and Recreation” alumnus Nick Offerman will star in the world premiere production of “A Confederacy of Dunces” with the Huntington Theater Company in Boston. The play is being adapted by Jeffrey Hatcher (“Stage Beauty”) from the beloved 1980 novel of the same name by John Kennedy Toole. Alan Friedman called the novel a “masterwork of comedy” in his review for The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Toole was awarded the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for the novel posthumously; he committed suicide in 1969. Many efforts have been made to adapt the novel. John Belushi, Will Ferrell and Jack Black were among those attached to various film projects that never fully developed. Mr. Offerman will be the first lead in the role, and will move from one outlandish egotist (on “Parks”) to another. “I am simply tumescent at the prospect of assaying the beloved character of Ignatius J. Reilly with our team of magnificent and weird artistic champions,” Mr. Offerman said in a statement. “It seems only fitting that I should follow seven seasons of Ron Swanson’s beef with the pudding of Toole’s corpulent fop.” David Esbjornson will direct. Performances are scheduled to run Nov. 11 through Dec. 13."

But three people have died because of Harry’s work, and now he’s worried that two more may soon die.

It’s bothersome because Mr. Coppola, the writer as well as the director, has nearly succeeded in making a great film but has, instead, made one that is merely very good.” "

What’s on TV Tuesday,2015-03-03,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"8 P.M.

Then Peppy insists that Valentin star in her next movie. This film, written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, also won for best director and best picture. “Though its protagonist mourns the arrival of sound, ‘The Artist’ itself is more interested in celebrating the range and power of a medium that can sparkle, swoon and suffer so beautifully that it doesn’t really need to have anything to say,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, choosing the film as a critics’ pick. And because of the expressiveness and dexterity of Mr. Dujardin and Ms. Bejo — “they dance beautifully and also portray emotion with just the right blend of naturalism and melodramatic exaggeration — ‘The Artist’ is more than a clever pastiche of antique amusements,” he wrote. “It may be something less than a great movie, but it is an irresistible reminder of nearly everything that makes the movies great.”"

It’s an essay that I suspect will be dismissed unread by a number of conservatives as just the latest iteration of the “America the ungovernable”/”the system has failed the president” genre popular among liberal writers in the waning days of struggling Democratic administrations. (Well, Jimmy Carter’s, in particular.) But Yglesias’s argument, to his credit, isn’t a lament for brilliant liberal reforms thwarted by filibustering bad guys and Madisonian mistakes; instead, he argues that President Obama has found ways to govern in the face of gridlock, mostly by the creative/Caesarist application of executive power to domestic policy, and that the next president, Republican or Democratic, will probably find ways to do the same. His point is that governance is increasing happening outside constitutional norms, not that it isn’t happening at all, and that it’s happening that way for reasons that are independent of particular chief executives and whose influence neither political party is likely to soon roll back."

Pecheux, for his part, was feeling more Chrissie Hynde and less David Bowie with the tattoo-looking designs he created under one of each of the models’ eyes. Inspired by the clothes, he drew the shape of a star out of the corner of the eye — “but we have seen that before,” he says. So he began erasing the star’s lines until he arrived at a more subtle geometric touch.

"The 17th Armory Show, New as Ever",2015-03-03,article,News,,"['ARMORY SHOW, THE INTERNATIONAL FAIR OF NEW ART (NYC)', 'Art', 'Collectors and Collections']","The annual international art fair, helmed by the young director Noah Horowitz, has evolved to meet the art market’s continually changing demands.","What’s that old adage about New York real estate? Location, location, location. So how is it that the Armory Show, which opens its 17th iteration this week, absolutely thrives on Piers 92 and 94 — which sit on the West Side Highway at 55th Street, otherwise known as Manhattan’s Siberia? The secret: its director, Noah Horowitz, who swooped in four years ago to save the fair from what was widely regarded as its hemorrhaging status. At the age of 35, Horowitz, who penned the art-market manual “Art of the Deal” and is a faculty member at Sotheby’s Institute of Art, commands expert status in the ways of the contemporary scene, and has made the fair his own. “Overall, I think the feeling is of renewed strength to the fair. We’ve made a huge emphasis on quality, in the stature of the galleries themselves — and I don’t mean just blue-chip galleries, but also young and mid-career ones, too,” he explains of his strategy. Since finding its foothold in 1999, the Armory Show, which draws its namesake from the Park Avenue Armory and its inspiration from the 1913 exposition accredited with bringing “shock of the new” modernism to America, has always emphasized, well, evolution. “One of the challenges in the market we operate in these days is things have become very flat, and a lot of things start looking the same,” says Horowitz, who stresses his investment in new artists and galleries.

That’s one reason Michael Rothbard, the president of Sleep Studio, created Newton Rest, a mattress company that does away with springs and foam. Its mattresses are made with a zip-off casing containing Wovenaire, a spongy, porous block of food-grade polymer developed in Japan. Once unzipped, the casing can be washed, and the Wovenaire can be hosed in the shower. The mattresses are recyclable (the company plans to accept used-mattress returns) and highly breathable. “Air passes easily through it,” Mr. Rothbard said. “Any body heat or perspiration you have during the night dissipates.” A crib mattress ($295) is to be introduced in mid-April; adult mattresses ($1,350 to $2,450), a month later; 212-679-6679, newton.rest or newtonbaby.rest."

What’s on TV Thursday,2015-03-05,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"6:35 P.M. (Starz Cinema) FAREWELL, MY QUEEN (2012) Sidonie Laborde (Léa Seydoux), the reader to Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger) at Versailles, watches as the French monarchy falls in this drama directed by Benoît Jacquot from a novel by Chantal Thomas. Noémie Lvovsky portrays the queen’s lady-in-waiting; Virginie Ledoyen is the woman rumored to be the queen’s lover. “If the rules and the players of this continuing, increasingly dangerous court intrigue remain obscure, it’s because ‘Farewell, My Queen’ is told through Sidonie’s eyes,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Tapping her palace sources, notably an archivist (Michel Robin) and a dressmaker (Anne Benoît), Sidonie learns of news known only to the nobility and their trusted stewards: that the Bastille has been seized.” Mr. Jacquot, she added, “has always been a sensitive director of actresses, his sympathies evident in his caressing, sometimes ogling camerawork and the time and space he gives women and their stories. That sympathy is evident here too, though crucially, while he doesn’t demonize Marie Antoinette, he doesn’t turn her into a spurious feminist martyr.” In French, with English subtitles."

Lusitania as sport divers returned triumphantly to the surface. When they came aboard, the gleeful explorers, part of a marine archaeology expedition sanctioned by the Irish government, produced a piece of history — a plastic container holding a handful of .303 rounds they’d found inside the plankton-­hazed ruins, rounds that had been manufactured in America and bought by the British to kill Germans during World War I. One of the divers peeled back the lid, and the corroded ammunition greeted fresh air for the first time in 93 years. “There’s thousands of cases of ammo down in that hole!” one of the Irish ­divers cried out. “You could just scoop the stuff up!” But then he turned somber.

Review: ‘The Art Show’ at the Park Avenue Armory Covers the Creative Map,2015-03-05,article,Review,,['Art'],The annual fair of the Art Dealers Association of America is showing 39 single-artist and 33 theme exhibitions at the Park Avenue Armory.,"What you see on entering “The Art Show,” the annual fair of the Art Dealers Association of America, is yourself and other visitors reflected in a giant mirror. Displayed in Luhring Augustine’s booth, “Cords,” by the veteran Italian conceptualist Michelangelo Pistoletto, consists of four mirrored panels with a cutout, photographic rendering of stanchions connected by fat ropes. The ropes evoke the atmosphere of exclusivity fostered by high-end galleries like the 72 convened here. On the other hand, the mirror inclusively reflects viewers themselves and, by extension, the broader public they belong to. In art, the public might find reflections of itself and its own, ever-evolving cultural identity."

It had a cool guerrilla buzz. In the former Dia headquarters on West 22nd Street in Chelsea, it was tiny compared with the cattle-call Armory Show. More rebelliously, admission was free. And the look was new. Instead of booths the size of stockyard stalls, there were wide-open prairies of exhibition space on all three floors. Within these democratic vistas, you could hardly tell where one gallery ended and another began."

Senate Will Postpone Debate on Iran,2015-03-06,article,Brief,,['Nuclear Weapons'],"Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, will postpone consideration of a bill giving Congress the authority to review any deal President Obama reaches with Iran on its nuclear program."," Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, will postpone consideration of a bill giving Congress the authority to review any deal President Obama reaches with Iran on its nuclear program, bowing to opposition from Democrats who charged that he was rushing the measure. Mr. McConnell, who this week set the stage for a procedural vote on the legislation on Tuesday, decided on Thursday that he would wait to bring up the bipartisan measure. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said that would give Democrats time to “decide whether or not they believe they and Congress as a whole should be able to review and vote on any deal the president cuts with the leaders of Iran.” The decision merely delays what promises to be an intense debate in Congress over whether Mr. Obama should be able to seal a deal with Iran aimed at blocking it from acquiring nuclear weapons and under what terms. A growing bipartisan coalition of lawmakers believes Congress must have a say over any such accord, and they are moving to lay out tough requirements for Mr. Obama that could shape any deal. "

What’s on TV Friday,2015-03-06,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Starz) MALEFICENT (2014) In this live-action back story to the 1959 Disney animated musical “Sleeping Beauty,” a happy young fairy (in a role shared by Isobelle Molloy and Ella Purnell) living in the moors becomes friends — and then something a bit more, involving a kiss — with a human farmhand (played by Michael Higgins and Jackson Bews). But eventually the boy grows into a man (Sharlto Copley) and helps wage war against the mossy wonderland of the fairy (now Angelina Jolie), whose wings are literally clipped. Now in an eternally foul mood, she retreats into a dark place, where years later she plots against his child, Aurora (Elle Fanning), who is destined to fall into a deep sleep after pricking her finger on a spindle. Ms. Jolie “makes a fabulous monster” as “she breezes through the movie, part superstar, part superfreak,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Consciously or not, coherently or not, ‘Maleficent’ tells a new kind of story about how we live now, not once upon another time. And it does so by suggesting, among other things, that budding girls and older women are not natural foes, even if that’s what fairy tales, Hollywood and the world like to tell us. And while that may sound drippy, it’s exactly the kind of hokey that, movie by movie, may finally make a real difference.”"

Indeed, for the contemporary Chinese artist Zhang Huan, whose restaging of Handel’s 18th-century operatic version of the myth opens for its first U.S. run this week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the constant of any opera “is found in the attention it pays to the human desire.” Speaking via an interpreter from his Shanghai studio a few days before the curtain was set to raise, Zhang freely admitted that he initially lacked interest in opera as an art form. Known for large-scale bronze statues of disembodied Buddhas and performance pieces entailing body suits made of raw meat, Zhang’s appointment to direct Handel’s opera in 2009, for the Brussels-based opera house La Monnaie, raised the eyes of both opera and art-world aficionados. “I had hoped people not only saw an opera, but also performance art,” Zhang says. “‘Semele,'” he quickly adds, “was my very first opera, and it will be my very last.”"

What’s on TV Saturday,2015-03-07,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Showtime) INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS (2013) Oscar Isaac portrays Llewyn, an aspiring folk singer mourning the death of his musical partner (the voice of Marcus Mumford) and leaving mayhem — a crying hostess, a pregnant woman, an escaped cat — in his wake as he bounces from couch to couch in Greenwich Village during a single week in 1961. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Stark Sands and Adam Driver round out the cast as Llewyn’s fellow folk singers; John Goodman is a drug-addicted jazzman; and Garrett Hedlund is a Beat poet. And while Llewyn’s background and antics were inspired by the life of Dave Van Ronk, “this is not a biopic, it’s a Coen brothers movie, which is to say a brilliant magpie’s nest of surrealism, period detail and pop-culture scholarship,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Isaac, a versatile character actor here ascending to the highest levels of his craft, refuses the easy road of charm.” One of the film’s lessons, as Mr. Scott sees it, is: “We are, as a species, ridiculous: vain, ugly, selfish and self-deluding. But somehow, some of our attempts to take stock of this condition — our songs and stories and moving pictures, old and new — manage to be beautiful, even sublime.”"

"1965: Marines Land in Vietnam by Sea, Air",2015-03-08,article,News,,['Vietnam War'],From the International Herald Tribune archives: first American Marines land in Vietnam in 1965.,"DA NANG, South Vietnam — Two battalions of U.S. marines today [March 8] landed by sea and air in South Vietnam to guard the strategic Da Nang air base, about 80 miles from the North Vietnamese border. Viet Cong guerrillas fired at the U.S. transport planes carrying many of the troops, but apparently the only result was a bullet hole in the wing of a C130 aircraft. No Marines were hurt. South Vietnamese government troops had spent the weekend flushing out Viet Cong guerrillas in the area to make the region around Da Nang as safe as possible for the 3,500-man Marine force to land. But the Marine deployment around the air base could soon lead to the first ground fighting between U.S. combat units and Communist guerrillas in Vietnam. U.S military men have been serving as advisers to South Vietnamese Army and Marine outfits in the field. But until now, there have been no American ground combat formations in South Vietnam. Spokesmen for the U.S military mission in Saigon said the Marines would remain under U.S. control, but their duties would be assigned after consultation with South Vietnamese military officers. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, March 9, 1965"

What’s On TV Monday,2015-03-09,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9:10 A.M.

Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave play Briony at different times in her life. “The main casualty of the film’s long, murky middle and end sections is the big moral theme — and also the ingenious formal gimmick — that provides the book with some of its intensity and much of its cachet,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “As the title suggests, ‘Atonement’ is fundamentally about guilt and the attempt to overcome it, and about the tricky, tragically imperfect power of art to compensate for real-life crimes and misdemeanors.” The film received six more Oscar nominations, including one for best picture, and won for Dario Marianelli’s score, featuring the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and a clacking typewriter."

(In many instances, the outfits — Ginsberg’s stained shirt, Megan’s “Zou Bisou Bisou” dress — almost feel like characters themselves.) Now, a new exhibition opening March 14 at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, “Matthew Weiner’s Mad Men,” brings the show’s wardrobe, and the rest of its creative process, to life. More than 25 of the ensembles developed by the show’s costume designer, Janie Bryant, will appear alongside props, advertisements and other ephemera from the show’s production department, giving fans the chance to see such garments as Joan’s blood-stained dress from the lawn-mower episode and Sally’s first minidress up close. Bryant worked closely with the museum’s curators to assemble the collection, even going so far as to track down clothing that had since disappeared into Hollywood costume houses. “To see a costume in full action on screen and then see it standing still,” she says, “is a whole different kind of visual experience.”"

The plan earned generally favorable comments from Yuval Levin, Ramesh Ponnuru and James Pethokoukis, all writers associated with the tendency we’re calling reform conservatism, but the addition of tax cuts on the business side drew praise from a wider range of conservative and libertarian policy writers and economists as well. The reformist interest in reorienting Republican tax policy toward middle-class families has created tensions with the party’s supply-side wing, but because it reforms the corporate/business code the Rubio-Lee plan clearly has the potential to be a politically-unifying vision, marrying pro-family and pro-growth policy while putting the era of “9-9-9″ and Fair Tax-style unicorns in the rearview mirror."

What’s On TV Wednesday,2015-03-11,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (BBC America) BROADCHURCH After learning that her husband, Joe (Matthew Gravelle), murdered Danny Latimer, Detective Sgt. Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman, above) returns to Broadchurch to hear what she assumes will be his guilty plea. But then he declares his innocence, forcing a courtroom battle that will re-examine the case. Detective Alec Hardy (David Tennant), meanwhile, finds himself embroiled in an unsolved murder and disappearance from his past. “Season 2 is, from the start, an entirely messier, more contingent affair, enjoyable in a different and, to me, more appealing way,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Having Joe plead not guilty enables Chris Chibnall, the show’s creator and writer, “to keep all the central characters of Season 1 around without the usual implausibility of plunging the town into a new mystery. It’s also a device to get Ms. Colman’s Ellie Miller back into the center of the story” — where she once again steals the show. “She’s a wonderful comic actress, and now even more than before Mr. Tennant is her straight man — Miller has had it, and Hardy has to absorb all of her (amusing) petulance and disgust.”"

For nearly 70 years, her classic bedtime story “Goodnight Moon” has lulled children to sleep with a picture of the warm comforts of home.

The room’s curious props include a comb, a brush and a bowl full of mush. Its most memorable line, “Goodnight nobody,” could have been written by Samuel Beckett. It is a brilliant children’s book, but its brilliance lies in its dreamlike oddity. Like a good witch, Brown weaves a kindly spell, and children succumb."

A third, the teenager Tony Gutiérrez (Johnny Ortiz), is placed is juvenile detention, while the fourth, Hector Tontz (Richard Cabral), is told that he will be extradited to Mexico. “This series is at heart a murder mystery — someone has been killed, and the show withholds who did it,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times about this limited series, created by John Ridley, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of “12 Years a Slave.” “But solving the crime isn’t the point.” What matters “is not just what is said but also the prickly sting of what is left unstated,” she added. “Miscommunication, misunderstandings and, on occasion, a stab of ice-cold reality are all part of the bereavement and also the investigation. ‘American Crime’ is a depressing story told so skillfully that it’s almost impossible not to be happy to see it unfold.”"

Mario Vargas Llosa’s ‘Discreet Hero’,2015-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Characters from previous Mario Vargas Llosa novels return in this tale of privilege, extortion and greed. ","When I think of the writers I adored in my 20s, during the 1970s and ’80s, it almost makes me think that winning the Nobel Prize in Literature must not be so hard, because nearly every one of them has won it: García Márquez, Bellow, Morrison, Coetzee, Naipaul, Grass and, in 2010, the youngest and only surviving member of the Latin American “boom,” Mario Vargas Llosa. I mention this not to pitch myself as a reliable Nobel handicapper but to point out the futility of ascribing any politically correct left-wing bias to the Swedish Academy, since at least three of those favorites — Bellow, Naipaul and Vargas Llosa — are about as politically correct as Margaret Thatcher. All three have been identified with the cultural and political right, none more so than Vargas Llosa, who ran seriously for the presidency of Peru and who to this day is probably, partly through the opinion columns he publishes in Spain’s El País, the Spanish language’s most prominent conservative intellectual."
"‘The Illuminations,’ by Andrew O’Hagan",2015-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A war-scarred man finds comfort in unraveling secrets from his grandmother’s past.,"The literature of war is by its very nature political. If a writer’s sentences are ­personal — what else, really, can they be? — and a writer has trained his lens on a bloody battleground, in reading him we will come to know where he stands, where his passions lie. When it comes to fiction, this passion can often result in ­rhetoric-spouting characters whose sole purpose is to service the author’s ideas. But in “The Illuminations,” the Scottish novelist and critic Andrew O’Hagan has created a story that is both a howl against the war in Afghanistan and the societies that have blindly abetted it, and a multilayered, deeply felt tale of family, loss, memory, art, loyalty, secrecy and forgiveness."

Reif Larsen’s ‘I Am Radar’,2015-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Reif Larsen’s novel takes on race and self-reinvention.,"Set aside for the moment the black baby born to white parents, the avant-­garde puppeteers and the quantum physics that swirl around the whole kit and caboodle. The most interesting facet of Reif Lar­sen’s 600-plus-page novel, “I Am Radar,” is that it reads like something far more compact than its bulk might suggest. There are maps, diagrams and pictures (e.g., an elephant plummeting from a bridge, a Cambodian prisoner of the Khmer Rouge) that remind one of the ­visual arrangements in W. G. Sebald’s novels. Then there is a deeply patterned narrative that darts easily from small-bore domestic dramas to sweeping historical catastrophes with just the right fillip of silliness and levity to keep the whole text eminently ­approachable."
Inside the List,2015-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Joseph Kanon, whose “Leaving Berlin” is No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list, spent 30 years “in the service of other people’s books” before writing his own.","The Insider: Joseph Kanon’s seventh historical thriller, “Leaving Berlin,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 11. Kanon first cracked the list with his debut novel, “Los Alamos,” in 1997 — but he was already well known in the book business before then, having spent some 30 years as an editor and publishing executive, including a stint as president of Dutton. During that long first act, Kanon worked with fiction writers including Muriel Spark, Louis Auchincloss, Frank Conroy and Jayne Anne Phillips. But he never dreamed of writing a novel himself, he told an Australian newspaper in 2009. “I didn’t have manuscripts secretly in the bottom drawer,” he said. “Honestly, I didn’t. I was happy in publishing. I was in the service of other people’s books. The last thing you want is to be in competition with your writers.” That all changed after Kanon left the industry in the mid-1990s, when he vacationed in New Mexico and was struck by the idea for a crime novel set during the Manhattan Project. “I never told anyone I was doing it,” he said. “I didn’t even tell my wife. I didn’t know if I could do it. What could be more embarrassing than a publisher who couldn’t write?”"
Mary Helen Specht’s ‘Migratory Animals’,2015-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Adulthood hasn’t come easy for the 30-somethings in this novel.,"Tales of naïve Americans abroad may have defined our national fiction around the turn of the last century, but the literature of the early 21st abounds with an entirely more sophisticated sort of traveler, perfectly exemplified by Flannery, the hard-as-nails heroine of Mary Helen Specht’s delightfully ambitious first novel, “Migratory Animals.” A far cry from Henry James’s Isabel Archer, Flannery — like many of her generation and station — is “on the lam” from both her middle-class, middlebrow roots and the lifestyle-driven superficiality carefully honed by her onetime college friends. She has settled in Nigeria less because her work as a climate-change scientist has repercussions for local farmers and more because it’s a few continents away from her sister, Molly, “an emotional tar pit” for whom Flannery served as a surrogate mother during the years when the girls’ actual mother was slowly, grotesquely deteriorating from Huntington’s disease."

"‘In Every Way,’ by Nic Brown",2015-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this novel, a woman takes a job as nanny to the baby she gave up for adoption.","It sounds impossible: Give up your baby for adoption and still spend every day with her. But Maria, the 19-year-old protagonist of Nic Brown’s novel “In Every Way,” does just that, becoming the full-time nanny of the daughter she gave away. This is an ingenious feat, considering Maria opted for a mostly closed adoption. That the reunion is nonetheless entirely believable is a credit to Brown’s gift for realism, and evidence that there is no anonymity in the digital age."
"‘The Death of Caesar,’ by Barry Strauss",2015-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Barry Strauss examines the assassination of Julius Caesar and its aftermath.,"Among the most poignant objects that survive from the era of the Ides of March — March 15, 44 B.C., the day Julius Caesar fell to the knives of Brutus, Cassius and perhaps 21 other senators — is a dime-size silver denarius, minted by Brutus a year or two after the murder. One side of this rare coin shows ­military-style daggers flanking a felt pileus cap, a symbol of freedom from slavery, and the abbreviation EID MAR. On the other side, remarkably, Brutus had his own portrait stamped. Before this, Caesar was the only Roman who had dared put himself on a coin, for to do so was to assume the stature of a monarch — or a god."
"‘The Rebellion of Miss Lucy Ann Lobdell,’ by William Klaber",2015-03-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This historical novel’s protagonist lived as a man.,"There are only two basic plots in fiction, writers occasionally say: “Somebody goes on a journey” and, the other side of the coin, “A stranger comes to town.” Brilliantly, William Klaber has managed to combine them. In this deeply satisfying historical novel, he recreates the voice of Lucy Ann Lobdell, a real mid-19th-­century New York woman who abandoned her young daughter and set out — dressed and passing as a man — to find the independence (and money) denied her as a woman. After many years of wandering as Joseph Lobdell, she married another woman and eventually found herself locked away as a lunatic."

Leading their unruly brood is Prince Liam (William Moseley, above center, with Ms. Hurley and Mr. Regan), the heir apparent after his older brother dies, who angers his mother by sleeping with the daughter (Merritt Patterson) of the queen’s head of security. Princess Eleanor (Alexandra Park), meanwhile, likes to drink, take drugs, seduce servants and bodyguards, and party in Paris nightclubs without any underwear. “The Royals” “should be a hoot, but it actually gets old, and dull, very quickly,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “It turns out that campy faux queens and princes can’t keep up with the real-life Elizabeth II and her progeny — or with reality show royals.” The Season 10 opener of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” — in which Kim and her husband, Kanye West, have sex in a bathroom, and family members act as if nothing were going on with Bruce Jenner, despite his ponytail and changing face — leads in at 9. Of the two series, “the Kardashians are better at keeping up appearances,” Ms. Stanley added. “The monarchy has survived in Britain for so many centuries partly because it protects its mystique and doesn’t bend to reality. The Kardashians have held onto their perch on cable television for 10 seasons for much the same reason.” "

Responding, in part, to the critics of my colleague David Brooks’s earlier column on morals and the social fabric, I made the case that there just hasn’t been the kind of significant increase in privation (or the kind of cuts to welfare programs; quite the reverse) that some writers on the left invoke as an explanation for why today’s poor and working class Americans are so much less likely than in prior eras to have children within wedlock and stay married when they do. Instead, notwithstanding all the burdens they bear and challenges they face, downscale Americans have somewhat more income and a much stronger safety net than their grandparents and great-grandparents did. So as much as economic burdens clearly play a role in family instability, and would be plausible explanations for the existence of a persistent rich-poor family-structure gap, they seem like weaker explanations for why out-of-wedlock birth rates have gone up so rapidly over the last half-century, not only among the underclass but increasingly in Middle America as well."

The Brooklyn-Born-Raised-and-Based Artist Who Dripped Her Way to Chanel Sneakers and Car Service,2015-03-18,article,News,,['Art'],"Joyce Pensato, a 70-something-old breath of fresh air whose current and fourth solo show is currently on view at Petzel Gallery, explains her slow rise to painterly fame.","The biggest change in Joyce Pensato’s life since her recent ascent to painterly panacea? “Oh, I only take car services now,” she giddily boasts. That’s also discounting the Chanel high-tops she splurged for recently at Barneys, but hey, she only bought them because they were comfortable. “Well, I got two pairs,” she confesses. In fact, that Uber is Pensato’s greatest quotidian extravagance at the age of 70 — or somewhere in that ballpark, a lady never tells — is revealing of a painter who not only remained in the New York art scene’s periphery until recently, but, like many women, took years to find the confidence to really be herself. “I was really isolated, I wasn’t connected to any scene, I felt so alone,” she says. It could be easy to lump Pensato into the art world’s growing trend of “discovering” artists in their golden years. But her big, brash, bold canvases of Batman, Bart Simpson and other pop-cultural totems, which have become instantly recognizable, actually are not simply the byproduct of some advanced-style fad. In fact, her current and fourth solo at New York’s Petzel Gallery, open until March 28, features the caricature motifs she’s been working in since as long as she can remember (as well a surrealist Pop-culture series of photographs she’s just beginning to explore). Though Pensato has been drawing her whole lifetime, her tale is one of a personal journey of self-expression and finding her own unbeaten path — even if “I never got off the L train,” she jokes."

Following them through long takes and static shots accompanied by abundant silence and sparse dialogue and music, the viewer feels the weight of time.

Review: ‘Richard Estes: Painting New York City’ Features Works in Abstract Realism,2015-03-19,article,Review,,['Art'],"This exhibition at the Museum of Arts and Design features the artist’s own photographs, cut up and pieced together to create his compositions.","Painting used to be as much a craft as an art. That began to change in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as artists like van Gogh, Picasso and countless others shifted the focus from technical virtuosity to the expression of individual sensibility and intellect. Bravura skills with the brush, like those of Bouguereau and other academicians, became anathema for the early Modernists. "

The rhythm of the editing is similarly deliberate: The camera looks at one person, then another, and patiently surveys a landscape or the interior of an old and magnificent building. This graceful, unhurried style, with its blend of austerity and artifice and its roots in classical French theatrical traditions, is Mr. Green’s signature. American by birth and ardently European by residence and vocation, he elevates formal decorum to a moral principle. “La Sapienza,” quiet and conversational as it seems, is a passionate defense of — and perhaps also an elegy for — an old and dignified ideal of civilization."

During seven days centered on Benjamin Franklin’s Jan. 17 birthday, thrift advocates taught people how to open savings accounts, buy insurance, purchase homes, pay bills promptly and share with others. By the early 1920s, Thrift Week was observed by more than a thousand cities in the United States, and still more around the globe. Thrift was put forward as the antidote to many of the nation’s perceived ills: working-class radicalism, urban poverty, squandering of natural resources and excessive consumerism."

"‘The Opposite of Spoiled,’ by Ron Lieber",2015-03-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],How to talk with children about money.,"I’m one of those people who are overcome with a strange combination of discomfort and ennui whenever they think about their children and money. Each time my husband brings up the topic of allowance, I wriggle out of the conversation, all but “la la la”-ing with my hands over my ears. Now I find I’m not alone. In his new book, “The Opposite of Spoiled,” Ron Lieber suggests that our unease about money prevents us from raising fiscally responsible kids. Open dialogue, he suggests, is the answer. Ask your children questions; listen to their answers. So I tried it. My husband and I waylaid our 16-year-old daughter, Lucy, as she headed out the door. “How much do you think we earn every year?” we asked. Lucy, who’s a pretty smart, sophisticated kid, replied after a moment’s thought: “Maybe around $10,000?” I don’t need to have an open dialogue with you, dear reader, but I will confess that’s not quite our income. I began to see how in the dark I have kept my children about our finances."
"‘The Great Beanie Baby Bubble,’ by Zac Bissonnette",2015-03-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A history of the Beanie Baby phenomenon.,"Beanie Babies, the small stuffed animals that retailed for $5, were introduced in 1993 and soon languished with mediocre sales. Then, a handful of neighbors in the Chicago suburbs discovered that each had a small collection and started trading with one another. They established some informal rules: Two Tabasco the Bull Beanies were equivalent to one of the rarer Kiwi the Toucan Beanies. Their trading spread and, eventually, went national. There were articles and TV segments about moms and dads who traded a $5 toy for thousands of dollars. Peggy Gallagher, an early trader, discovered that the Beanie craze hadn’t hit Germany yet and placed an order with a distributor in Nuremberg. She paid $2,000, including shipping, for a box of the toys that, back in the United States, had a value of $300,000, a return of nearly 15,000 percent. If she were a hedge fund trader with those numbers, she’d be the talk of Wall Street for generations. Instead, she was the talk of countless parents, who came to believe they, too, could fund their kids’ college education or an early retirement if they just got their hands on the right Beanies. The frenzy coincided with the start of eBay and the rise of home Internet use. Early on, Beanie Babies represented 10 percent of eBay’s sales. "

Our favorite board game, of course, is Monopoly, which has also gone global, and for similar reasons.

The game is sufficiently redolent of capitalism that in 1959 Fidel Castro ordered the ­destruction of every Monopoly set in Cuba, while these days Vladimir Putin seems to be its ultimate aficionado."
Karen E. Bender’s ‘Refund’,2015-03-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Money (who has it, who doesn’t) is the dark heart of these tales.","Money is ostensibly the fuel that powers Karen E. Bender’s new collection, “Refund.” In the title story, a couple falsely advertises a TriBeCa sublet just before 9/11 to pay for a fancy nursery school. In “Reunion,” a woman impulsively buys an unseen plot of land on credit. Smaller risks prove to be, if not turning points, then those moments remembered in relief as emblematic of the Before — splurging on beef Wellington for supper, say, or setting up a kids’ lemonade stand — by those now living in the After. The theme works as an organizing tenet, but Bender’s subtler preoccupation is the eroding effect of emotional want."

"‘God’s Bankers,’ by Gerald Posner",2015-03-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Gerald Posner offers a financial history of the Roman Catholic Church.,"Ask a devout, theologically literate ­Roman Catholic to describe the institution of the church, and you’re likely to be told that it was founded by Jesus Christ at the moment he gave his disciple ­Peter the “keys to the kingdom of heaven” and vowed that “whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven.” This made ­Peter the head of the universal church, ­empowered to administer the sacraments, spread the Gospel, save souls and forgive sins until Christ’s return, as well as to pronounce with infallible authority on ­matters of Christian faith and morals. Christ also promised Peter that “the gates of hell shall not prevail” against the church — meaning that no matter how corrupt the institution might appear at any given moment of history, it will never be so consumed by evil that it ceases to be capable of fulfilling its God-appointed tasks.

Lehane remains closely identified with his native Boston, but this historical thriller — which continues a series about the fictional gangster Joe Coughlin — is set mostly in Florida and Cuba, while Lehane himself moved to Southern California a year and a half ago. He recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he was sorry to miss his hometown’s record snowfall this winter. “Bostonians, for better or worse, tend to like hard things,” he said. “You don’t really feel like something is fully worthwhile unless it’s hard-earned. It’s that sense of working-class pride, which, yeah, can be kind of annoying but can be really cool. So when I saw my friends emailing about getting the snow record, I thought, ‘What a bunch of sick bastards,’ but I really dig it. I’m jealous I’m not there, in a way.” Lehane added that his pleasure reading these days is confined to children’s books. “The go-to guy is Mo Willems,” he said. “Anyone outside of the children’s world has no idea who Mo Willems is. I didn’t. But anyone who has kids, he literally takes you from the very first book to all these great books I’m reading with my 5-year-old. He’s the Dr. Seuss of our time.”"

Over 35 minutes, it traces Knight’s childhood as the son of two illustrators, the creation of Eloise, his creative tussles with the “Eloise” writer Kay Thompson and a post-Eloise career that’s included work for Vanity Fair, the publication of his own books and the illustration of posters for Broadway shows like “Gypsy.” Most compelling are the scenes of Hilary moving through his magically curated home, decorated with staged bird nests, an underwater-themed bathroom and countless pieces of his parents’ work, dressing up in a full gorilla suit or directing a short musical film in his backyard."

What’s on TV Tuesday,2015-03-24,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"12:30 P.M. (AMC) AMERICAN GANGSTER (2007) Ridley Scott directs this Oscar-nominated crime drama set in the 1970s. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) is a gangster in Harlem who finds that he can get the best heroin cheap from Southeast Asia, smuggled to the United States in the coffins of American soldiers sent from Vietnam. He calls the heroin Blue Magic and takes over the market. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is an obnoxiously honest New Jersey detective. When his partner (John Ortiz) dies from an overdose of Blue Magic, Richie is asked to lead a drug trafficking task force. A corrupt New York detective named Trupo (Josh Brolin) bridges the gap between the two lead characters. “You can almost feel Mr. Scott trying to coax the material away from its generic trappings toward something rarefied, something like Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 definitive American story, ‘The Godfather,’ ” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “He comes closest to that goal with the suggestion that the lethal pursuit of the American dream is not restricted to one or two families — the Corleones, say, or the Sopranos — but located in a network of warring tribes that help to obscure the larger war of all against all.”"

The foundation also predicted that 45 percent of households that received subsidies will probably get a refund, because their 2014 income was lower than what they estimated when they applied for coverage. Under the law, people can receive subsidies to help cover the cost of insurance purchased through online marketplaces if they earn between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Taxpayers generally receive subsidies in advance, with the amount based on their projected household income for the year the insurance policy will be in effect. But they must then reconcile the estimate with their actual income when filing federal taxes. Kaiser estimated that subsidy recipients who underestimated their incomes will owe $794 on average, while those who overestimated will receive average refunds of $773. "

Only after tying the knot with her guest does Rosa Lee learn that he used to be Mac Sledge, a country singer who drank his career to death. This drama — directed by Bruce Beresford and written by Horton Foote, who won an Oscar for best screenplay — follows Mac’s relationships with his ex-wife (Betty Buckley), his daughter (Ellen Barkin), his new bride and her son, “weaving them into a sadly contemporary vision of family life and heading toward a final note of affirmation,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals with all of these things in equal measure. Still, the absence of a single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively small price to pay for the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined.”"

The 16-mile-long island of extravagant mansions, tony retailers and fanciful landscaping is rich in history and significant landmarks, from the magnificent Mar-a-Lago estate (completed in 1927 for Marjorie Merriweather Post, now Donald Trump’s private club) and the Paramount Theater (a former movie palace that houses a trove of vintage screen star photos) to St. Edward’s church (where the Kennedys worshiped) and Green’s Pharmacy (where John F. Kennedy enjoyed burgers in the luncheonette). But Palm Beach is also a small gem offering simple pleasures. You can ride a bike anywhere or linger over coffee at a lunch counter and never be more than a block or two from the beach. Even the new Orange Line trolley that shuttles riders between arts destinations in Palm Beach and neighboring West Palm Beach adds a down-to-earth touch to this high-rolling town (and it’s free!). When the season ends after Easter, parking spots and dinner reservations are readily available once again (not to mention discounted restaurant and hotel prices), making this perhaps the best time of all to visit."

Ms. Hershman Leeson began her career in the San Francisco Bay Area in the culturally roiling early 1960s. Like many young artists then, she identified as a painter, but one with multimedia extensions and futuristic ambitions. Almost from the start she was also working in sculpture that had a cyborglike dimension.

Hayv Kahraman: ‘How Iraqi Are You?’,2015-03-26,article,Review,,['Art'],The artist builds on the refined figuration of Persian miniatures that are part of her cultural background as an Iraqi.,"Reviving once great artistic styles can be a fraught pursuit, whether or not they are part of an artist’s cultural heritage. Such styles must be transformed into something personal and contemporary that ideally also survives comparison with its inspiration. In her second solo show at this gallery, subtitled “How Iraqi Are You?” Hayv Kahraman largely pulls off this difficult feat, building on the refined figuration of Persian miniatures that are part of her Iraqi background. In Ms. Kahraman’s hands the delicacy and stylization of the source are writ large and on raw linen — evoking the pages of a Persian album — and complicated with allusions to other times, places and styles. The paintings depict pairs and groups of nearly identical women who may or may not be in a harem. Shown in conversation or listening to one of their number, these women have pale skin, gestures and becalmed features that recall both the female subjects of Renaissance painting and the powdered geisha of Japanese woodblocks. Their articulated hands seem puppetlike. Their largely strapless gowns and black bouffants seem of recent American vintage even as the fabric patterns of their gowns elaborate a veritable lexicon of Arabic geometric decoration. Ms. Kahraman has devised several stylizations of her own, especially in the ways the fabrics drape and overlap while remaining flat, and in details like eyebrows and those dark bouffants (which, for viewers of a certain age may recall Lady Bird Johnson’s hairdos)."

Aptly called “Unidentified Suspended Objects” (USOs), they consist of flat, geometric wooden elements assembled into angular, planar volumes with their outer surfaces clad in all kinds of inexpensive materials, including rubber, fake fur, leather and colored plastics. He painted their interiors, visible through skewed openings, with fluorescent colors so that they seemed to glow from within. This exhibition presents eight pieces.

What’s on TV Friday,2015-03-27,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"12 A.M. (Comedy Central) PINEAPPLE EXPRESS (2008) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (“Superbad”) wrote this comic stoner caper directed by David Gordon Green. Mr. Rogen stars as Dale Denton, a process server who loves to smoke weed to escape the tedium of his life. He witnesses a murder while smoking a joint of rare marijuana and throws it out the window of his car in a rush to flee the scene. He goes to see his dealer, Saul (James Franco), and they become paranoid that the killer (Gary Cole) will be able to identify him as the witness because of the distinct pot he had been carrying. Off they run, without confirming that they are being pursued. Danny McBride plays an eccentric, backstabbing, midlevel drug dealer, and Rosie Perez portrays a crooked cop conspiring with the murderer. And a strain of pot is named “Spanish trampoline.” Writing about the film in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said, “In the tradition of Cheech and Chong, Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, Ricky and Lucy, Martin and Lewis, Rowan and Martin, Smothers and Smothers, Sanford and son, Spicoli and Hand, Bert and Ernie, Riggs and Murtaugh, cops and robbers, dumb and dumber, right brain and left, peanut butter and jelly, bong hit, roach clip and Snoop Doggy Dogg comes ‘Pineapple Express,’ a stoner comedy that partakes of a gentle indie vibe before hitting the hard stuff for a major Shane Black-style blowup and meltdown.”"

The crew members, who had been held in prison three months, were accused of mutiny after they refused to sail for France from a South American port on the first day of the war. ‘‘The case was born of an excited imagination,’’ said M. de Moro-Giafferi. ‘‘The crew has been imprisoned and slandered when all that the men wanted was an equitable judgment. The sailors maintained that they had not mutinied, but had refused to leave port under their captain, whom they considered irresponsible. Several testified they had heard the captain threaten to ‘‘run his ship aground and demolish it.’’ Politics or war conditions had nothing to do with the refusal, according to the crew. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, March 28, 1940 "

Inside T’s Design Issue,2015-03-27,article,News,,[],Our latest issue looks backward to the aesthetics of the hedonistic ’70s and oddly alluring po-mo ’80s.,"T’s latest issue examines the current state of design by looking backward — namely, to the hedonistic ’70s and oddly alluring po-mo ’80s. The onetime California home of Gerald and Betty Ford is a perfect example of this revival; its new owners have kept many of the house’s original charms (including a giant portrait of the former First Lady), while adding their own contemporary touches, to create a space that’s anything but conservative. Likewise, the purist Mark Haddawy — the co-founder of the retailer Resurrection Vintage and restorer of Modernist houses — has doubled down on his version of ’70s California cool by doing very little to his own home in Big Sur. And the fashion reporter and insider Mary Russell, who for many years was as likely to cavort among (and occasionally hop in bed with) her stylish subjects as she was to photograph them, reminisces about Europe in the freewheeling ’60s and ’70s. Elsewhere, Nicola Del Roscio, the longtime close companion of Cy Twombly, remembers the late painter while creating his own Eden in the hills of Gaeta, Italy; Sarah Lucas, the former rude girl of British art, discusses how she grew up without losing her nerve; Ricky Gervais and Zaha Hadid say yes to sriracha-flavored ketchup and a floor-cleaning robot while lounging in a giant bird’s nest; the New York magazine co-founder and “I Heart NY” creator Milton Glaser gets the By the Numbers treatment; and a handful of authors with new books out this year pay tribute to the spaces where they write.

He’s arguably among the most polarizing jurists of his stature in American history, and inarguably the most combative justice currently on the court.

What’s on TV Saturday,2015-03-28,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"6:45 P.M. (Sundance) SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) Shaun (Simon Pegg) and his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), are having problems because of Shaun’s insistence on always doing the same thing. He likes to hang out at the pub with his friend Ed (Nick Frost) and has yet to meet Liz’s mother. After Liz dumps Shaun, he continues in his habits. Shaun and Ed are so complacent that it takes them an astonishingly long time to realize that the odd events increasing in frequency around them are the result of a zombie outbreak. Shaun and Ed find themselves in a comedic fight for survival in which zombies are fought with bad records and clumsy luck in this film directed by Edgar Wright (“Hot Fuzz,” “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World”). “There is something intrinsically ridiculous about zombie movies,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The British horror comedy ‘Shaun of the Dead’ skillfully plays off that ridiculousness by implying that Britain may already be populated with the living dead, metaphorically speaking.”"

Pigeons scatter. He slumps, closes his eyes, loses sight of the London skyline, loses consciousness. He has done something wrong in the restaurant downstairs — though as the scene plays out, this transgression is revealed to be little more than drunkenness.

In this filmed version of Christopher Reid’s narrative poem “The Song of Lunch,” the slumping man is played by Alan Rickman. Emma Thompson is the woman who’s been looking across the table at him with disdain. She’s gone by the time he descends. "
