Scavengers with a nine-and-a-half-foot wingspan, condors are sacred in Yurok cosmology, but it has been more than 100 years since they soared over the tribe’s ancestral territory, in northwestern California. Next spring, Williams-Claussen and her team, along with state and federal government partners, hope to release six juvenile birds born in captivity.

In fact, a thread of nostalgia runs through all of Ahluwalia’s designs: In addition to drawing from the aesthetics prominent during her own childhood, she pays homage to those of other cultural epochs, as well as to her family’s Nigerian, Indian and Jamaican heritage and the broader immigrant experience in the United Kingdom."

During their five years in the desert, Kamara and her father, a mining engineer, traveled frequently into the nearby mountains, where they visited caves rich with neolithic paintings and polished stone, remnants of a time when the area was green and populated by nomads. “This open archaeological site really gave me a sense of what my region is about,” says Kamara, 41, who splits her time between Providence, R.I., where her husband is a professor of computer science at Brown University, and Niamey, where her firm, Atelier Masomi, has operated since 2014. “It’s not the story we’re fed about Africa being this place with no history.”"

A bride sat onstage in a traditional white lace gown before a banquet of Persian pastries and urns overflowing with pastel-colored roses and baby’s breath. The groom, seated next to her, wore a paisley-printed ski jacket, its high, mouth-covering neck pre-empting the protective masks of the pandemic.

This was a deliberate move on Farzaneh’s part intended to highlight the power imbalance she feels in her industry — where a woman truly at the helm of her own brand is still something of a rarity — and was typical of the subtle gestures toward the tensions of our present moment that are embedded in her line. At the end of the ceremony, the groom rose and strode down the aisle, followed by a procession of young men dressed in looks from the fall 2020 collection of Farzaneh’s namesake line, which combined the swagger and oversize silhouettes of streetwear with the understated, earthy palette of hand-printed Iranian textiles."

Later — though some years earlier in the looped chronology of Michael Almereyda’s new film — Tesla and Thomas Alva Edison, his rival and erstwhile employer, attack each other with ice cream cones. At another point, our narrator, Anne Morgan (daughter of the mighty financier J. Pierpont Morgan), flips open a laptop to compare the results of a Google search for Tesla and Edison. These whimsical moments of speculation and anachronism remind us that “Tesla,” which chronicles a crucial period in the inventor’s life, is anything but a conventional biopic."

Could a shift in approach slow the spread of infections?,"Accuracy is everything, typically, when we take a diagnostic test — an incorrect result can lead to anguish and erroneous, if not harmful, treatment. Currently the most reliable way to identify a coronavirus infection is by a polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) test: A swab, usually taken from the nasal passage, produces a sample that is then sent to a specialized laboratory. P.C.R. tests, which can detect minute amounts of genetic material from the virus, cost upward of $100; in ideal circumstances, they take just hours to analyze. But because of high demand, supply shortages and other issues, many commercial labs are taking more than a week to process them. That means a positive test often comes back too late to enable contact tracers to notify those who have been exposed before they might in turn infect others. In these circumstances, the diagnosis is useful only for making personal health decisions and providing data on the rate of infection in a community."

A Longstanding and Most Iconic Motif Is Reimagined,2020-08-20,article,News,,['Fashion and Apparel'],"Nicolas Ghesquière presents a new, if retro-feeling, take on Louis Vuitton’s signature monogram.","Some logos move in and out of favor with the seasons. Then there’s Louis Vuitton’s signature monogram canvas, with its interlaced L and V flanked by various geometric flowers, which seems to be another thing entirely, one impervious to trends and maybe even time itself. In fact, the monogram hasn’t always been around, nor does it date to the house’s founding in 1854, when Louis Vuitton, who had previously been a packer for Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, began selling travel trunks out of a store on Paris’s Rue Neuve-des-Capucines, just off Place Vendôme. His go-to motif was a waterproof gray canvas. The monogram came into existence just over four decades later, when Louis’s son, Georges, took inspiration from the kitchen tiles of the family’s home in Asnières in north-central France. The house, built in 1859, was decorated in the Art Nouveau style, and the tile pattern featured a trio of flowers outlined by a clover that was in turn set within a circle, as well as diamonds with petal-like points. Another reference may have been the Gothic Revival then sweeping through France — when seen through that lens, the monogram can’t help but recall architectural quatrefoils carved out of stone or glass in the era’s great cathedrals. What is certain is that, in designing it, Georges was acting in honor of his father, who had died four years prior, leaving the brand’s legacy in his son’s hands."

Lee was a Confederate general, a slave owner and a commander in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. (The middle school I attended in Tyler, Hubbard, was also named for a former Confederate officer, who later became the state’s governor.) A large portrait of Lee hung in the school gym, and whenever I saw it, I felt as if my right to this country, to Americanness, was being challenged.

More than a third of these monuments have been removed since May 25 of this year alone, when a Minnesota police officer named Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder, was caught on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, for more than eight minutes while Floyd pleaded for his life.

Chapo Guzmán, the world-famous drug lord, had hired a young IT guy and the kid had built him a sophisticated system of high-end cell phones and secret servers, all of it ingeniously encrypted. The unconfirmed report—perhaps that was the best way to describe it—had arrived that Friday in June 2009 when a tipster walked into the lobby of the FBI’s field division office in New York. After his story had been vetted downstairs, it made its way up seven flights of stairs and landed with a curious thud among the crowded cubicles of C-23, the Latin American drug squad. For more than thirty years, the elite team of agents and their bosses had hunted some of the drug trade’s biggest criminals, and while tall tales of their antics circulated constantly through its squad room near the courts in Lower Manhattan, no one in the unit knew what to make of this one. The tipster’s account seemed credible enough but it was sorely lacking details: the only facts he had offered on the young technician were a first name—Christian—and that he was from Medellín, Colombia. All sorts of kooks spouting all sorts of nonsense showed up all the time at FBI facilities, claiming they had inside information on the Kennedy killing or knew someone who knew someone who knew where Jimmy Hoffa was. In what were still the early days of Internet telephony, it seemed a bit far-fetched that a twentysomething hacker had reached a deal with the world’s most wanted fugitive and furnished him in hiding with a private form of Skype. As alluring as it sounded, it was just the sort of thing that would probably turn out to be a myth."

Probably the top kid-lepidopterist in Champaign County, in his own humble opinion. At night his bones ached and added marrow, and each morning his limbs felt more sinewy and masculine, as if he’d somehow entered the body of Davy Crockett. Or Daniel Boone.

What’s on TV Friday: ‘Following’ and ‘The Roads Not Taken’,2020-08-28,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",Revisit Christopher Nolan’s debut feature. Or stream the latest movie from the filmmaker Sally Potter.,"FOLLOWING (1998) Stream on Criterion Channel and IFC Films Unlimited; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. When hardy audiences trek to theaters to see Christopher Nolan’s latest mind-bender, “Tenet,” in theaters next week, they can expect two things: masks in the movie house and puzzles on the screen. For that has been the Nolan way for nearly two decades: In 2001, Nolan’s “Memento” offered “a series of clever epistemological puzzles,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. Nolan’s film “The Prestige,” from 2006, “has a satisfyingly puzzlelike structure,” Scott wrote in his review. The filmmaker’s 2010 dream-hopper, “Inception”? It “trades in crafty puzzles,” Scott wrote. “Interstellar” in 2014? “Tantalizing puzzles,” Manohla Dargis wrote. All echo “Following,” Nolan’s 1998 debut feature, which gave a taste of his knack for cinematic discombobulation. Shot on a shoestring — the cost of making “Following,” reported to be in the low thousands, was surely less than the hair gel budget delegated to the men of “Inception” — the film plays fast and loose with chronology, telling the story of a young Londoner (Jeremy Theobald), whose hobby of tailing strangers leads him to the city’s criminal underbelly. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin called the movie “a black-and-white film noir with a difference,” writing that “the usual elements of scheming and deception are well represented here, but they are made all the knottier by shifting time frames.” And, she noted, the story “offers plenty of intriguing puzzle pieces.”"
