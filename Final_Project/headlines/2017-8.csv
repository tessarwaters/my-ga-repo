The point being, I think, that I can find another guy or get inseminated, so it’s not fair to have his baby because of my biological-clock concerns. I’ve read a lot about the ethics of expecting him to be involved or pay for support if he doesn’t want the child but not about whether it’s O.K. to choose to have the child at all. "

Weiss., the creators of “Game of Thrones,” recently announced their next project: a series for HBO called “Confederate,” which imagines life in the United States if slavery had never been abolished. The news triggered a firestorm on Twitter, with some people calling for the show’s cancellation. “Detroit,” a new film about racial oppression and police brutality during the 1960s, made by Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, has also caused controversy. When asked by Vanity Fair if she was the ideal person to tell this story, Bigelow said: “No. However, I’m able to tell this story.” Earlier this year, “Open Casket,” an impressionist rendering of the viciously beaten body of Emmet Till by the painter Dana Schutz, enraged some visitors to the Whitney Museum of American Art, where it was featured as part of the annual Biennial.

How to Lament,2017-08-04,article,News,,['Grief (Emotion)'],Make the tears visible. Alliterate rather than rhyme. Improvise.,"‘‘You must have visible tears,’’ says James M. Wilce, an anthropology professor at Northern Arizona University who studies lamentation, or what he calls ‘‘melodic wailing’’ with words. Wet cheeks are the minimum: In some places, funeral keeners throw themselves to the ground, sway their bodies or beat at their chests. These age-­old, songlike wailing traditions are found worldwide — one ethnomusicologist studying in Egypt has noted that modern mourners raise their clenched fists skyward in the exact posture depicted in ancient tomb paintings — but they’re disappearing from most places. Not so in Finland, where an organization that Wilce studies runs instructional workshops on lamenting as the Karelian people of the region have done for centuries. These three-day classes add a modern twist: Rather than being performed solely at a wake (by what Finns call a ‘‘cry woman’’), impromptu requiems are devoted to all manner of emotional hardship, from divorce to illness."

Mertz (who wrote the series under the name Elizabeth Peters) was herself an accomplished Egyptologist, with a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, and she often based her novels on actual episodes from the discipline’s colorful history — as in the new book, “The Painted Queen,” about the discovery and theft of a priceless bust of Nefertiti. But she hadn’t made much progress when she fell ill, and was still working out details of the plot with occasional help from her friend and fellow novelist Joan Hess. So her estate, naturally enough, asked Hess if she would finish the book that Mertz had started. “My first response was an adamant refusal,” Hess writes in a preface to “The Painted Queen,” new at No. 7 on the hardcover fiction list. “The idea of attempting to capture her voice, her erudite style, her wit and her vast knowledge of archaeology in the early 20th century seemed ludicrous.

How Do I Deal With a Gun at a Relative’s Home?,2017-08-09,article,News,,"['Firearms', 'Discrimination', 'Homosexuality and Bisexuality', 'International Study and Teaching', 'Ethics (Personal)']",The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on a family’s prejudices against gun ownership and the guilt of making more money teaching English as a native speaker.,"The patriarch of our large family came out of the closet as an elderly man nearing the end of his life; he now has a husband who is much younger, whom I will call Tim. The family embraced Tim, but the adjustment has been rocky, especially among some of the men. Tim has earned back this trust by being both husband and physical caretaker of our ailing relative. One recent evening, while his husband was ill, Tim and I sat alone in their home. The conversation turned to gun politics; I’m a closeted gun rights sympathizer. Perhaps sensing some undue camaraderie, Tim stole away to the foyer, then returned with an unloaded black shotgun and ammunition. Tim told me not to mention this to our family — or to my relative, who doesn’t know about the shotgun even though they live together. We also have children in the family, who visit Tim and his husband with frequency, and I’m well aware of the statistics about households that keep guns. I plan to advise Tim at least to move the gun elsewhere, out of the house. However, that does not seem to be enough. Having the gun in the house suggests a lack of judgment; it seems like a serious breach of trust and, God forbid, potentially dangerous. Doesn’t this directly contravene Tim’s claim to being a responsible caretaker, an ethical impetus that overrides confidentiality? Another twist: I also know that if the gun (or ammunition) were discovered, it could be just the excuse our extremely anti-gun family needs to disavow Tim. This seems like a bitter pileup of issues — gay equality, gun safety and family loyalty. Name Withheld"

A decade later, she opened a shop on the design-boutique-rich Pimlico Road, which has become a pilgrimage site for local and visiting aesthetes. Sparingly appointed with Regency chairs and Art Nouveau sconces — as well as simpler pieces, including a giant copper planter designed by Uniacke and stocked with firewood — it also carries her own line of furniture and her newly launched fabric collection, which, as one might expect, is exactly what you need for modern country life: supple linens from the U.K. and mohair velvets in earth and jewel tones — and nothing more."

"Attacked on All Sides, an Anti-Trump Manifesto Prevails on the Best-Seller List",2017-08-11,article,List,,"['Books and Literature', 'Conservatism (US Politics)', 'United States Politics and Government']","Jeff Flake’s “Conscience of a Conservative” pays homage to Barry Goldwater, whose 1960 book of the same title was a best seller for 31 weeks.","FLAKE NEWS: Quick, who wrote “Inferno”? (A) Dante. (B) Dan Brown. (C) All of the above. The right answer is of course (C), and thanks to Brown — I like to picture him introducing himself at cocktail parties as “Dante Brown” — there is recent precedent for borrowing a classic’s title in hopes that its posterity might rub off. (It worked for Brown. His Dante-influenced thriller spent more than a year on the hardcover and paperback fiction lists.) Even so, the Republican senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has raised eyebrows by calling his new anti-Trump manifesto “Conscience of a Conservative.” That’s because Barry Goldwater’s 1960 book of that title, which stayed on the Times nonfiction list for 31 weeks, is still revered as a founding document of the modern conservative movement. Right-wing commentators who aren’t as ready to abandon the president see Flake’s appropriation of the name more as apostasy than as the homage Flake intended, and object to the book’s attacks on the Republican establishment. (“We pretended that the emperor wasn’t naked,” Flake writes. “Even worse: We checked our critical faculties at the door and pretended that the emperor was making sense.”) Brent Bozell III, president of the conservative Media Research Center and son of Goldwater’s collaborator (some say ghostwriter), recently insisted that “Jeff Flake is not a conservative, nor does he have a conscience,” and he called on his “conservative brethren to denounce this impostor.” You know you’re in trouble when your critics are using the word “brethren.” Not that liberals are much happier. In The New Republic this month, Alex Shephard applauded the book’s message but said that Flake — who “has voted with Donald Trump 95 percent of the time” — was the wrong person to deliver it."

We didn’t talk much because we were focused on our food, but when we did, it was about the mysteries of the delicious. A chicken-fried steak is nothing to champion, after all, at least on its face. It’s just cheap beef pounded thin, dressed in seasoned flour and fried, an Americanized taste of the schnitzel brought to Texas by German immigrants in the 19th century. Peppery cream gravy generally accompanies the steak. That gravy can be gummy when it’s not prepared well. And the steak beneath it can be dry, or soggy, or both. Ours was neither. Walsh and I marveled at the way the texture of the meat’s crisp exterior was heightened by the silkiness of the gravy, at the way sweet and salty combined in the dish and at the manner in which the whole experience was so much greater than the parts. Soon enough I went home to recreate the meal."

"Review: ‘Unlocked,’ a New Spy Thriller, Same as the Old Spy Thrillers",2017-08-31,article,Review,,['Movies'],Noomi Rapace plays an undercover C.I.A. agent in a film that serves up clichés with its suspense.," The spy thriller “Unlocked” is an apt and not entirely unentertaining demonstration of the adage “the more things change, the more they stay the same.” The movie has a female lead (Alice Racine, played by Noomi Rapace) as its intrepid, smart, lethal spy, so that’s something. Instead of Cold War chess moves in the mode of “Funeral in Berlin,” it serves up the ostensible threat of Islamist terror. Racine is an undercover C.I.A. agent posing as an employment counselor in London. She’s loath to do fieldwork because she feels responsible for not thwarting a terrorist strike in Paris years ago. But she’s pulled back in by the prospect of a horrifying biological attack. She needs to interrogate — “unlock” in spy-speak — a courier whose message could set the plan in motion, or stop it."
