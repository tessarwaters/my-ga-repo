"‘Map: Exploring the World,’ ‘The Curious Map Book’ and More",2015-12-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Maps']",Several new books explore the power of spatial representations and how they shape our perceptions of reality.,"What is it about maps that we find so fascinating? Ever since the Babylonians scratched two parallel lines and a circle — representing the Euphrates River and their walled capital — on a clay tablet almost 3,000 years ago, we humans have been producing flat spatial imagery to locate our place in the world. Maps anchor us, give coherence to our environment, help make visual sense of otherwise intangible realities. The most skillfully done maps, moreover, can be thrilling to look at, elevating cartography into art. Renaissance mapmakers filled the borders of their works with beautifully rendered dragons and wind-puffing gods; the modernist painter Jasper Johns playfully reimagined the standard road-atlas depiction of the continental United States in his 1961 work “Map.” Maps can solidify national identity, expose societal problems, illuminate trends and whip up jingoistic emotions in wartime. “The map as a concept is complex and ever changing,” the Library of Congress cartography expert John Hessler writes in his introduction to “Map: Exploring the World.” But “it is the cartographic image’s intricate and abstract visual element that is the locus of its strength and lasting appeal.”"

And no matter what we think of it today, it has been forever since Hollywood was all it’s cracked up to be. As Marlene ­Dietrich once wrote, “When I came to Hollywood, the great era of silent films was over and done with. The village was not ‘gay and reckless’ anymore. The studios operated like any other establishment — one had to clock in at a certain hour and heaven help you if you failed to do so.

He cuts an odd figure as portraitist of the Harlem Renaissance and its successors. He was a culture vulture and party-giver who liked to be in on the latest thing, and maybe his friendships with African-­American artists and intellectuals represented nothing more than a kind of cultural tourism. Certainly W.E.B. Du Bois mistrusted him, and Ralph Ellison “despised his photography,” and he alienated many with his sensational 1926 roman à clef, “Nigger Heaven.” But he got Langston Hughes published, and furthered the careers of others; Walter White, head of the N.A.A.C.P., named his son Carl. And whatever the motivations behind them, his portraits are extraordinary — lapidary and noble and often majestic — and it is clear that he had a genuine rapport with many of his subjects."

No writing that claims such a focus can truly be dispassionate, but “Rise” aims to be more comprehensive than rousing. That’s not to say that the authors, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Kevin M. Burke, are without their prejudices — more on those in a moment. But in these times when race so sizzles at the forefront of the public consciousness, “Rise,” particularly in its earlier chapters, can feel encyclopedically bland — and that’s probably the book’s most refreshing trait. The surprisingly objective telling somehow lends itself to an enjoyably subjective experience. "

Life is ephemeral; we are in eternal transit. Every dawn, gardeners the world over stroll outside, view the depredations of the night’s creatures and learn to accept impermanence. Gardens are among the most evanescent of our arts. But we dig in anyway, making what we can of our plots — and resisting any thought of their unmaking."

"Cooking: ‘Asian-American,’ ‘Women Chefs of New York’ and More",2015-12-02,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Cooking and Cookbooks']","Today, the best recipes communicate a rebellious spirit and a back story.","What qualifies these days as an extraordinary recipe and do any of us really need another cookbook to find it? I know I don’t require even one more traditional recipe for summer rolls, chicken curry or mushroom risotto. As Dale Talde writes in ASIAN-AMERICAN: Proudly Inauthentic Recipes From the Philippines to Brooklyn (Grand Central Life & Style, $32), we “used to want food to be a pat on the back, not an uppercut to the chin.” Today, the best recipes communicate a rebellious spirit and a back story amounting to more than a fill-in-the-blank: “I went to X and fell in love with Y.” Whether it’s Thailand and green papaya salad, Israel and lemon-mint couscous, or France and sole meunière (if you’re Julia Child), these stories have grown tiresome if not precious. I gravitate toward lawless recipes that fall under the admittedly loose rubric of what Talde calls an “immigrant’s cuisine.” This is food undergirded by a strong tradition of regional home cooking overlain by the potent influence of “diners, gyro shops, Polish delis, taquerias, burger joints, Chinese spots and other food meccas.” This food is defined as much by “meat loaf and hot dogs” as it is by “shawarma and roti, tacos and yakitori.”"

"‘The Jemima Code,’ by Toni Tipton-Martin",2015-12-02,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Cooking and Cookbooks']",A scholarly yet accessible survey of ­African-American cookbooks that begins in the days of slavery and reaches to the late 20th century.,"The suggestion that one could begin to excite a meaningful “fact-finding” conversation about the foodways of the African-American experience — of black men and women from the advent of slavery through the Industrial Revolution, the Civil War and the resulting Emancipation, not to mention Jim Crow or the struggle for the right to vote — is remarkable. In “The Jemima Code,” her inspiring account of the stories of our unsung and unrewarded history, Toni Tipton-Martin has made such a claim and has served up a slice of history with bold flavors, cultural enlightenment and real-life images of the people of color whose culinary contributions are realized in these pages.

The War Within Tonya Pinkins,2015-12-02,article,News,,['Theater'],Ms. Pinkins plays the title role of Brecht’s “Mother Courage and her Children” in a Classic Stage Company production.,"As the artistic director of Classic Stage Company since 2003, Brian Kulick, who steps down at the end of this season, making way for John Doyle, has had a knack for persuading great actors to challenge themselves in classic roles (like Peter Sarsgaard in “Hamlet” and F. Murray Abraham in “Gallileo”). So it’s fitting that one of his last productions at the intimate gem of a theater pairs Tonya Pinkins with one of the mightiest roles in the canon, the title character in Brecht’s “Mother Courage and Her Children.” In playing the canny survivor ground down by a war-torn world, Ms. Pinkins will be following the likes of Fiona Shaw and Meryl Streep. Ms. Pinkins often seems to elevate her material, but when she sinks into a complex role worthy of her gifts — “Caroline, or Change” is perhaps the best example — the results can be thrilling. That’s what makes this show such a downtown event. Duncan Sheik, the composer behind “Spring Awakening,” wrote new music. Mr. Kulick directs.

This was the beginning of a love affair that would take Schlesinger to London, straight into the eye of a twister of bohemian glamour and creativity. While studying painting at the Slade School of Fine Art, he began to capture the most magnetic personalities in the couple’s social circle with his Pentax camera. There was the fashion designer Ossie Clark and his partner Celia Birtwell, the model Amanda Lear, Manolo Blahnik, Paloma Picasso, Cecil Beaton and the man who would eventually become Schlesinger’s lifelong partner, the Swedish-born photographer Eric Boman. With a natural, snapshot-like aesthetic, Schlesinger managed to conjure happy, blink-and-they’re-gone moments in time. There were weekend trips to Beaton’s country house, wine-drenched lunches by the pool at Tony Richardson’s in the South of France and late-night dancing at everyone’s favorite underground club in London, Yours or Mine. These effervescent images became the basis of his first book: ‘‘Checkered Past,’’ published in 2003. Schlesinger recently released a second volume, ‘‘Peter Schlesinger: A Photographic Memory 1968-1989’’ ($50, Damiani), which includes some of his greatest (and formerly unseen) hits from the London years plus images from his life after he and Boman moved to Manhattan 37 years ago. Schlesinger, now a ceramic artist, has lived and worked with Boman in the same former girdle factory in the Flatiron district for these past decades. Four months a year they decamp to their house in Bellport, N.Y., where Boman bakes and Schlesinger tends the garden. ‘‘These days I take more pictures of my plants than anything else,’’ he says. ‘‘But they’re my friends, too.’’"

Pictures are more than prose carried out by other means. And there is some category confusion when it comes to a book like Adrian Tomine’s “Killing and Dying.”  “Graphic short story” doesn’t sound quite right, but how else to describe the half-dozen vignettes in this collection, each one bristling with acute observations and piquant ironies? These tales — pocket epics of romantic, creative and social frustration set in recognizably drab, drably picturesque American landscapes — certainly invite comparison to the work of words-only short-form masters like Raymond ­Carver, Ann Beattie and Mary Gaitskill, and for that matter O. Henry himself. You can almost forget you’re looking at drawings."

The word infuses “Joy Ride,” his collection of profiles and reviews from more than 20 years at The New Yorker. He finds deep cultural resonance in August Wilson’s “Seven Guitars,” about blues musicians in the 1940s, because “it teaches through joy, not through reason.” The Broadway director Susan Stroman (“The Producers”), whose personal sorrows include the death of her husband, says, “Tapping into joy — it saves you.” And writing about the film and stage work of Ingmar Bergman, whom he visited at home on the island of Faro, Lahr finds “another kind of joy” in “the audacity of Bergman’s camera, in the vigor of his argument.” The word morphs as it meets its subjects."

Hugh Fraser and, later, wife of the playwright Harold Pinter — made the startling discovery that she was “not really a girl.” That is, having just spent four years learning Greek and Latin at a school for boys (mostly) called the Dragon, next door to her family’s home in Oxford, England, she excelled at ancient languages and at the knock-’em-sock-’em sport of rugby, but was completely unschooled in conventional girlish behavior.

In “First Bite: How We Learn to Eat,” she traces this instinct to a ritual she had with her father when she was a teenager. Her parents had just split up, and whenever her dad would send Wilson on a train back to her mother’s house, he’d buy her a magazine and a box of chocolate-coated malted milk balls, something that, before her parents’ divorce, would have been deemed a special-occasion treat. She felt powerless to refuse the candy, even as she was struggling with a disconcerting weight gain. It took Wilson years to realize that her father’s gesture was as much about making him feel like “the generous provider” as it was to reward her with a happy sugar high. She writes: “To give a child the things she loves to eat bestows a heroic glow. It feels almost as wonderful as eating.”"
"‘Chapter and Verse: New Order, Joy Division and Me,’ by Bernard Sumner",2015-12-04,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Music']","Sumner’s memoir has the mild-­mannered charms of his vocals — clumsy, earnest, endearingly tongue-tied.","The glamorous rock-star life, circa 1983: The gawky Manchester kids in New Order visit the legendary New York disco Funhouse to shoot a video for their new single, “Confusion.” They hang with their producer, Arthur Baker, and the superstar D.J. Jellybean Benitez, watching from the booth while the crowd moves. It’s poignant how dazed New Order looks in this video — a couple of years earlier, they were your basic mopey indie twits, and here they are making the scene as their music plays at the world’s hippest dance club. Yet the most poignant sight is that of the singer Bernard Sumner, who spends the first half of the clip wearing deck shorts and white tube socks.

One wakes her in the morning by throwing up on the edge of her pillow. Her drug of choice is black coffee.

In Denis Villeneuve’s drug war opus, “Sicario,” it is hard to fathom any other actor as Alejandro, a tormented Mexican ex-prosecutor turned avenger who alternately menaces and protects the F.B.I. agent played by Emily Blunt. Mr. Del Toro’s performance has foisted him into Oscar contention for best supporting actor, a category he won in 2001, for his role in “Traffic.” He was nominated again in 2004 for “21 Grams.”"

Connell — and to praise school libraries and independent bookstores, encouraging his listeners to help those institutions if they could: “Let’s all be literarians, whatever the hell that means.” He also revealed that his debut mystery, “The Thomas Berryman Number,” had been rejected 31 times before finding a home. “I keep a list of all the editors who turned down my first novel,” he said. “Sometimes they send me books and ask for blurbs.

On offer at Greene Naftali is a historical work by the recently deceased German painter Gunther Forg — who, though prolific like Toroni, is known for constant variation rather than repetition.

"‘The Occupation Trilogy’ and More, by Patrick Modiano",2015-12-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The Nobel Prize winner Modiano’s novels often return to occupied France.,"I will not resist the temptation to read in “Pedigree” — Patrick Modiano’s 2005 memoir, newly translated in the wake of his 2014 Nobel Prize — the stuff of everything else he has ever written. Modiano has encouraged such conflation, for one thing, in interviews and essays and the like. But this on its own would be insufficient justification. Fiction or nonfiction — or, more accurately, something in between — Modiano’s more than 25 published works form a constellation of intersecting narratives that challenge any readerly desire for clarity or closure. The open-ended dialogue Modiano sustains among all of his writings frames the sketches and unsure rememberings that make up this autobiographical snapshot. Terse, yet somehow infinitely generous, “Pedigree” both enacts and accounts for Modiano’s fraught relationship with memory and the past — his own and those of his country. It outlines the stakes of his literary practice and reveals the specific sufferings this practice entails."
Marilynne Robinson’s ‘The Givenness of Things’,2015-12-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Marilynne Robinson looks at America’s Christian beliefs in the Age of Information.,"A sense of wonder pervades the powerful essays in “The Givenness of Things,” Marilynne Robinson’s new collection. “Existence is remarkable, actually incredible,” Robinson exclaims; even materiality is “profoundly amazing, uncanny.” Yet unlike physics, which has a strong sense of the “givenness” Robinson refers to in her title, neo-Darwinian positivism rejects anything — the self, the soul or God — that cannot be explained empirically. Robinson defines the “given” as something “that presents itself, reveals itself, always partially and circumstantially, accessible to only tentative apprehension, which means that it is always newly meaningful.” Calvin insisted that divine wisdom was one such “given,” perceived only “within radical limits.” Robinson does not say so, but here Calvin was deeply in tune with the great sages of the past, who all maintained that the transcendence we call God, Brahman, Nirvana or Dao must always ultimately elude us."

As in all of Allende’s fiction, we find a large, colorful cast of characters, this time swirling around the octogenarian Alma Belasco, happily if peculiarly ensconced in Lark House, a retirement home in San Francisco. Foremost is Irina Bazili, the young Moldovan immigrant whose repressed “terrors” of adolescence form a drumbeat of foreshadowing through the three years of her service to Alma. But as the story lurches back to the late 1930s and then to the highlights between, we also meet Alma’s Jewish family in pre-World War II Europe; the San Francisco relatives who adopt her; the entire family of her Japanese lover, Ichimei Fukuda; and a host of other lovers, care givers, evildoers and saints. No character is so minor as to lack a back story. At the same time, no character, including Alma and Irina, manages to fill in his or her outlines and command our undivided attention."

He took pictures of friends and strangers, meals and toilets, framed paintings on walls, fridges left open, shop fronts after hours: anything, it seemed, at which the camera could be pointed. The body of work he made over the next two years, eventually exhibited and published as ‘‘American Surfaces,’’ feels oddly familiar now. With its flatness and indiscriminate subject matter, it looks just like the stuff people put on Instagram.

The mother telegraphed to an undertaker in that town ordering an elaborate coffin, and requesting that the remains should be sent home for burial. Just before the funeral on Sunday the mother had the coffin opened, and found that it contained, not her child, but the body of an old officer in Russian uniform. On making inquiries she learned by telegram from Nice that the bodies had been accidentally exchanged. Her daughter’s body had been forwarded to Smolensk in Russia instead of that of the officer. On telegraphing to the Russian authorities Madame Wachterhausen was informed that the body of her daughter had just been buried with great ceremony and military honors. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 12, 1915"

Briggle had never even heard of fracking when he was hired as a professor of philosophy at the University of North Texas, in 2009. But with around 250 gas wells drilled within Denton’s city limits, the subject was thrust upon his consciousness. A member of the City Council asked him to form a citizens’ advisory group for gas-well regulations, and Briggle became a field philosopher, running across highways, helping collect air samples from backyards, consulting not only Mary Shelley and the theologian Duns Scotus to help guide him along “the arduous trail that is thinking” but also scientists, engineers, mayors, neighbors and his daughter, Lulu, a 2-year-old rogue impervious to propaganda."

We heal the world by healing each and every one of our hearts.” If that kind of talk triggers flashbacks to your last cardiologist visit — the best way to heal our hearts is probably to eat less bacon — it remains true that Tutu writes with undeniable moral force. And given his experiences leading the Truth and Reconciliation Commission after apartheid’s fall, his prescription is not just simple but consistent and radical. “In South Africa, we chose to seek forgiveness rather than revenge,” he writes. “That choice averted a blood bath. For every injustice, there is a choice. . . . You can choose forgiveness or revenge, but revenge is always costly. Choosing forgiveness rather than retaliation ultimately serves to make you a stronger and freer person.” As it happens, your cardiologist might agree. According to the Johns Hopkins Medicine website, “Studies have found that the act of forgiveness can reap huge rewards for your health, lowering the risk of heart attack; improving cholesterol levels and sleep; and reducing pain, blood pressure and levels of anxiety, depression and stress.”"

William H. Gass’s ‘Eyes’ and John Barth’s ‘Collected Stories’,2015-12-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Collections of fiction by two American writers over 80 test the boundaries of narrative form.,"Every so often a magazine with curatorial or prophetic aspirations — say, Granta or The New Yorker — produces a list of the best writers under 40 from a particular nation state. The underlying principle isn’t much more than the logic of the marketplace — the search for the new commodity, explicitly applied to literature. But these lists are haunted by a cluster of unspoken questions about writing’s relationship to longevity. Are writers so short of material that they need to be anointed before midlife? Is novelistic craft not perfected over time? If the answers to these questions aren’t obvious, why not imagine a shadow list that gathers the best American fiction by writers over 80? William H. Gass — 91 years old at the time of writing — would certainly benefit from such a list, since his work typically gestates across decades. He labored on his central achievement, “The Tunnel” (1995), for longer than some acclaimed young novelists have been alive, while his latest volume, “Eyes,” has similarly been in the pipeline at least since the turn of the millennium."

This year’s annual performances of Handel’s “Messiah” went by, alas, without him.

The choir sings wonderfully, whether accompanied by Mr. Buzard or Benjamin Sheen on organ, or Sara Cutler on harp. Several of the boy trebles — some of whom by now, as such things go, may well be baritones — have lovely solo moments. Yet another worthy memorial to a beloved figure on the New York music scene.

The resolution builds on previous Council measures, also legally binding, that make it illegal to donate money to terrorist groups, trade in oil and antiquities or make ransom payments. Those prohibitions are sometimes ignored, and the new resolution, drafted by Russia and the United States, is intended to strengthen it. The resolution calls on countries to describe what steps they are taking to prevent terrorist organizations from making money, including interdicting oil sales. The effects may be limited: The Islamic State group draws a large share of its revenues from “taxes” imposed on the people who live in its territories. Perhaps the most incongruous element of the resolution is that one of its sponsors is the government of Syria. "

Inside the List,2015-12-18,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Claudia Rankine’s hard-to-classify “Citizen” stayed on the monthly race and civil rights best-seller list all year.,"Indefinable: Poetry doesn’t hit the lists very often, but when it does, it can hit big. In 2015, Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen” stayed on the monthly race and civil rights list all year; it’s currently No. 5. A hard-to-classify volume of prose poems, or lyrical essays, about daily encounters with racism — “I wanted to replicate the sense of having these stories come at you,” Rankine told The New Statesman — the book has also spent time on the paperback nonfiction list and, more counterintuitively, the monthly relationships list. (One place it hasn’t appeared yet is the monthly politics list, although that may change now that a young woman in Illinois was spotted reading it at a Trump rally.) The people who compile the Times lists aren’t the only ones who have struggled to define Rankine’s book. Last winter, “Citizen” became the first title ever nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in two categories: A finalist in criticism, it won in poetry. So what is this book, exactly? And how does Rankine feel about efforts to pin it down? “If we leave the structural hybridity of ‘Citizen’ aside,” she told me via email, “I want to believe there is a recognized veracity of experience for the people categorizing the book. Each feels ‘Citizen’ satisfies some truth or intention for their category. I am a poet, and I didn’t fictionalize the accounts told to me or taken from my life or from the news; I simply submerged my thinking into the ‘ethical loneliness’ (a phrase taken from the title of Jill Stauffer’s excellent book) that the sentences accumulated. The lyrical reflection of lives struggling to negotiate racism in our culture apparently feels authentic to many categories. That seems right.” Then she quoted a line from “Sentences and Paragraphs,” by Gertrude Stein: “Never ask any one what a sentence is or what it has been.”"

Milan, Spokane, London, Washington, Tulsa, Tuscaloosa, Cleveland, Des Moines, Chicago, Charlottesville: He’s crossed the deserts bare, man, he’s breathed the mountain air, he’s been everywhere. Morse is a motivational speaker, which accounts for his traveling, but he also moonlights as a reviewer for a website called RateYourLodging.com, which accounts for the way this novel is constructed: as a series of 37 hotel reviews. (One way we know we’re in a fictional ­universe: Morse suggests he is paid for posting his opinions online.) The hotels under review range from the Plaza in New York City (Morse, as a child, spent a night there in the early 1970s) to a Radisson in Waterbury, Conn. (an ideal place, he notes, for those “in search of the loneliest night imaginable”), to the Capri Whitestone in the Bronx, with “its view of the Whitestone Bridge toll plaza” and “the overpowering reverberation of death” in its communal bathroom."

High grades, high test scores and admission to one of the nation’s elite colleges have long been embraced as symbols of excellence and, by extension, successful parenting. Abeles suggests that pursuit of this narrow form of success is actually harming children and families, and distorting our educational institutions. Her book is bound to be controversial, particularly to the education establishment — university presidents, the testing industry and the policy makers who support them. For many of them, “Beyond Measure” is likely to be regarded as a threat, if not downright subversive. "
"‘The Art of Grace,’ by Sarah L. Kaufman",2015-12-18,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An author and dance critic would like us to reclaim a lost virtue.,"“The Art of Grace” . . . “The Art of Grace.” It is concerning when the title of a book has a wannabe whiff. Or is it just graceless me that smells it? But the alternative, in this case, is worse, and it is as precious and highfalutin as it sounds given that the author is not Thomas Aquinas or John Ruskin. It is a phrase that promotes its author as an arbiter of grace, a lofty perch indeed from which to view us mere clumsy mortals. And so, Sarah L. Kaufman, in her first book, sets the stakes perilously high, particularly since her subject is not exactly origami but grace, that fragile, exquisite, transient entity of unparalleled depth, breadth, complexity and profundity. She has taken on, perhaps to her credit, the Sisyphean task of persuading us to choose grace over ego and so revisits that epic battle where grace loses every time — though ego never wins. Such ambition! But why not? We are in can-do America, and the author, dance critic for The Washington Post for almost 20 years, has a Pulitzer Prize in her pocket."

‘The Great British Baking Show’ Is the Key to Understanding Today’s Britain,2015-12-21,article,News,,['Television'],Does “Britain” even exist anymore? And is an aggressively quaint reality show about baking the best answer to that question?,"It is becoming increasingly clear that Britain no longer really exists. I’m not sure exactly how long this has been going on. Last year, for instance, the nation formed from the 1707 Act of Union between the English and Scottish crowns very nearly tore itself apart de jure, holding a nervous and fractured referendum on Scottish independence. The vote was eventually won by the “No” camp, preserving Britain as a political entity, but it was clear the moral victory had been lost regardless. The “Yes” campaign made an exciting and convincing case for an independent Scotland, to which people could be proud to belong.

How many will even hear about the news that enrollments are once again running above expectations, and the pool is getting younger?"

Or so, at least, the thinking has traditionally gone. The sonnet, for instance, is practically built on the idea of poetry’s unfading presence, from Petrarch’s assertion that “our art is that / Which makes men immortal through fame” to Shakespeare’s claim that “Not marble nor the gilded monuments / Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme.” Similar rhetoric tends to appear whenever a critic is doling out high praise, whether it’s Randall Jarrell announcing in 1947 that some of Robert Lowell’s poems “will be read as long as men remember English,” or Jason Guriel writing in Poetry magazine in 2010, pretending to review Kay Ryan from a distant future in which she’s become an inescapable literary influence.

Betting $3 Million on a Wall Street Art Spectacle,2015-12-24,article,News,,['Art'],The artist Simon Birch is mounting a risky extravaganza of installation art in the old headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Company.,"Across the street from the New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan, the British artist Simon Birch sat in a cavernous room with fireproofed girders, a rickety table and three wobbly office chairs for company. For most of the 20th century, 23 Wall Street was a temple of profit, the sumptuous headquarters of J. P. Morgan & Company. For the last decade or so, save for the occasional fund-raising event, it has been a neglected hulk. But Mr. Birch, 41, a tall man dressed in black, with neon-green sneakers and a sweep of dark-blond hair, hopes to restore some of its luster with a huge art installation opening here April 14."

Inside the List,2015-12-24,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"James Rollins’s “The Bone Labyrinth,” new at No. 9 on the combined fiction list, is crammed as usual with a gleefully preposterous mix of science and legend and wild-eyed conspiracy theory.","In With the New: James Rollins’s latest Sigma Force thriller, “The Bone Labyrinth” — new at No. 9 on the combined fiction list — is crammed as usual with a gleefully preposterous mix of science and legend and wild-eyed conspiracy theory, stuffed in so willy-nilly you suspect Rollins had to sit on the book just to get it closed. The plot this time has something to do with genetically engineered superhumans and the Apollo 11 moon landing and the supposed remains of Adam and Eve, which gives you an idea why Rollins sells so many copies; he’s what you might end up with if you tossed Michael Crichton and Dan Brown into a particle accelerator together. Rollins has long been an unabashed book nerd — in high school, he wore a “Keep On Tolkien” T-shirt — but he didn’t try his hand at writing novels until he had worked for some years as a veterinarian. That career influenced his thinking in this book, he told The Fort Worth Star-­Telegram, especially about evolution and intelligence: “I wanted to explore one of the big anthropological mysteries: How come, even though the human brain has remained about the same size for the past 200,000 years, there was a sudden explosion of ingenuity and creativity about 50,000 years ago? Anthropologists call it the Great Leap Forward, and it has baffled them as to what exactly the trigger for it was. Why did human intelligence suddenly surge ahead? I also had a file on Neanderthals. I found it curious that, at roughly the same time, 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals and modern man started to interact and breed, passing Neanderthal DNA into our lineage. No one has addressed the possibility that maybe this was the trigger. I have a background as a veterinarian, so I’m familiar with the fact that if you cross a donkey and a horse to get a mule, the mule has been shown to be a more intelligent animal than the donkey or the horse. I started thinking, ‘What if this kind of crossbreeding is the source of the Great Leap Forward?’ That’s how my stories build. I ponder these different concepts, I blend the science and the history, and the stories begin to layer like an onion, one layer upon another upon another.”"

Yet even in this field of enthusiastic editors working hard to promote authors while holding down day jobs, the affection displayed by the New ­Jersey-based Bloof Books for the poet Jennifer L.

In the opening poem, “Reverse Voyage,” Jackson tells us where that is: “I come / back to unlit alleys, avenues in sheaths of grit / and utility wires like veins stitched to power supplies / buzzing above a different kind of hum.” The utility wires run like veins through the speaker as well, and we realize this reverse voyage is not a return trip but a confirmation that no matter how far the speaker journeys — for success, for beauty, for his art, for his woman — he carries home in his blood."

At a time when most art photographers produced what Walker Evans described as “misty October lanes, snow scenes, reflets dans l’eau, young girls with crystal balls,” Sander’s documentary approach came as a clarifying, astringent solution. Here were men and women, children and old folks, farmers and bohemians, bricklayers and engineers, all portrayed with startling lucidity. Evans, who would acknowledge Sander’s influence on his own work, hailed “Face of Our Time” as “a case of the camera looking in the right direction among people.” More recently, Sander has inspired such contemporary photographers as Joel Sternfeld and Alec Soth."

Writers from Robert Bly to Mary Karr tried to interest a wider audience in Tran­stromer’s austere beauty and stark mystery, but he never quite took, despite being considered, along with Seamus Heaney and Wislawa Szymborska, one of Europe’s greatest poets.

James Tate’s ‘Dome of the Hidden Pavilion’,2015-12-24,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets']",Stylized narratives conjure a small-town world of traumatized war veterans and exploding cows.,"James Tate, who died in July at age 71, was the rare American poet who managed to make poems that were at once fanciful and grave, mundane and transcendent: He believed “the challenge is always to find the ultimate / in the ordinary.” That quotation captures some of Tate’s American plain-spokenness but not the dark currents of beauty he is capable of, or the way the “ultimate” becomes a tonic, in his poems, for the chaos around us. His work is singular in American poetry for marrying goofball humor and childish jouissance to a lyricism that never seems cheap or self-serious — an unusual achievement. Now we have his 17th book of verse, “Dome of the Hidden Pavilion,” which, like many of his recent books, is composed of prose-poem-like narratives about surreal small-town encounters. Inside its hidden pavilion, we find invisible alligators, toy soldiers that turn out to be alive, traumatized war veterans, exploding cows, existential despair. This is the Tate mode: serious absurdism, absurd seriousness."

The career of C. K. Williams, who died in September, precedes him. Winner of the trifecta of American book awards (the National Book Critics Circle Award, the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize), he was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a longtime professor at Princeton University and the recipient of almost every major fellowship and ­citation available to poets. He published well and often, writing 21 books of poetry (which include an earlier volume of selected poems and two editions of collected poems, the second published in 2006), a memoir, three books of essays, two ­children’s books, several volumes of translation and, earlier this year, his 22nd collection, “Selected Later Poems.”"

Her embalming fluid of choice is sulfuric acid. “The guy was a loon,” Myles writes midway through a poem that manages to slam Lowell, arguably the consummate duke of the straight, white, old-money ­patriarchy, with what comes off like a posthumous knee to the groin."

Anne Boyer’s ‘Garments Against Women’,2015-12-24,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets']",Boyer’s poetry honors the quotidian.,"Poetry and political economy would seem to be odd bedfellows, but they’ve been consorting at least since Thomas Malthus quoted Alexander Pope in his “Essay on the Principle of Population” and Wordsworth wrestled with Adam Smith in “The Prelude.” Within “political economy” lurk the oikos (household) and the polis (the city); our reigning algorithmic savants and financial quants too often forget this. Anne Boyer has not forgotten this. She has written a sad, beautiful, passionate book that registers the political economy of literature and of life itself. This sounds dry, abstract: It’s not. Boyer’s book moves as if the contents of a ­brokenhearted country song were mediated through the ferocious mind of a Hannah Arendt. Boyer offers a self-portrait of the artist in a time of “indentured moods,” debt collection, chemical spills, amid her attempts at and refusals of writing, sewing and the daily care of herself and her small daughter."

Between his birth in Mexicali in 1953 and his death at 58, he published 20 books of fiction and poetry, all of them consistently unpredictable.

Bird readies her son for school, sees her husband out the door, takes a bath with the baby. An old friend calls, and they share stories about the past.

At the United Nations, meanwhile, Eban defended the operation, assailing Syria’s implacable hostility.

"‘Infectious Madness,’ by Harriet A. Washington",2015-12-31,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Mental Health and Disorders']","A survey of research presses the case that infections, even in the womb, are linked to mental illnesses like schizophrenia.","One hundred and sixty odd years ago, Ignaz Semmelweis realized that physicians who didn’t wash their hands were carrying tiny germs from bedside to bedside and causing the childbed fever that killed many women. After doctors began washing their hands, fewer women died. The series of realizations in the 19th century that germs — bacteria and viruses — caused diseases like cholera and tuberculosis and influenza ushered in modern medicine. Mortality rates declined; children lived longer. Germ theory had a dramatic clarity to it. It pushed medicine away from holistic conceptions of illness as imbalance toward conceptions of illness as a specific entity. You get the germ, you fall sick, you take antibiotics or fight it off (or die). Ironically, though, the tidiness of this relationship helped obscure cases where germs may have less direct but still devastating effects — a complex reality we are now beginning to understand better."

Appearing for the first time in Thomas Perry’s new thriller, FORTY THIEVES (Mysterious, $26), these former Los Angeles police detectives have been married for over 30 years and have children and grandchildren.
