Remembering the Stately Dinners of a Private Club,2021-01-05,article,News,,['Cooking and Cookbooks'],“Art at the Table” celebrates more than a century of dinners at the Lotos Club in New York.,"Since 1872, New York’s Lotos Club, a literature and arts organization founded in 1870 that occupies a townhouse on East 66th Street, has regularly held banquets to honor notables in the arts, government, science, entertainment, sports and the business world. Well-known people tried pulling strings to be the featured guest. The dinners also include elaborate menus, sometimes featuring the art of the honoree. It’s all documented in “Art at the Table,” a lavish new book that describes around 120 of the 439 dinners that have been held through 2019. In the first 50 or so years, oysters, green turtle soup, fillet of beef and an ice cream dessert dominated the menus. Back in 1874, King Kalakaua of Hawaii was the celebrity guest, but no women were honored until 1922, when the opera singer Mary Garden was selected. (Women could not join the club until 1977.) The authors have threaded anecdotes throughout, like Mark Twain’s nap during his 12-course meal, a special Peruvian menu served for Mario Vargas Llosa and the menu printed on a Beethoven score for Richard Arnold, a violinist. The name of the club was taken from “The Lotos-Eaters” by Alfred Tennyson."

Sound doesn’t want to be contained; it undulates easily through air, concrete, brick and wood. In fact, it moves faster through solids, with their more densely packed molecules. An acoustic drum set is a high-decibel instrument with low frequencies particularly suited to spreading. Adjust your expectations: You can’t truly soundproof a room without decoupling it from the larger structure, which means building a new room within your existing room, preferably with several inches of air space and acoustic insulation between the two. Such a project will cost thousands of dollars, and if you’re a renter, landlords aren’t likely to sign off. You can buy pricey, prefabricated sound-insulation rooms, but Israel often advises his percussion students to go the cheaper, sound-dampening route. To do that you’ll want to hang drapery, acoustic-foam tiles or even mattress toppers over walls, ceilings, floors and doors. If you’re a drummer and can get away with it, leave your windows uncovered. “You deserve light,” Israel says. “People always make drummers play in basements.”"

We ended up spending the next two evenings and nights together. Hopeful that we might actually make it stick, I stayed in touch, even once I figured out that he had already — before his visit — entered another relationship. He wrote me heartfelt, regret-filled emails and assured me that he was working on extricating himself from this “Plan B.” After connecting on and off for months via email, text and phone, I learned not only that he had entered a relationship but also that it was with an old flame, and that he slipped an engagement ring on her finger well before came to see me. I feel great pain and sympathy for his fiancée, who has been as betrayed and disrespected as I have. We are both victims; he selfishly stole a year of my life and caused me emotional trauma sure to haunt me forever, and she is probably preparing to enter a marriage that will be defined by lies. She just doesn’t know it. I want this woman to walk down that aisle with her eyes open; but there’s a part of me that wonders whether I am just seeking revenge.

With 368 pages of his photographs, mostly of food scenes from around the world, interspersed with compelling text, the book is hard to put down (and hard to lift up). He says it covers 15 years of travel and eating. The tone of his writing (in translation) is chatty yet serious, threaded here and there with wonderment at some of his encounters, like the man in New Delhi who told Mr. Bech he was eating at the wrong places and offered restaurant recommendations one day at a time. Reading what Mr. Bech has to say might make you a more confident cook. He gives advice like this: “Remember, you can always add things. It’s harder to remove things.” He’s particularly attached to his chopping board and his blender and to Espelette pepper. Most of the nearly 40 recipes, in blocks of text, are simple and tempting, but often unusual — and one of the reasons I couldn’t stop reading — like one for corn in a pan, with butter and egg. There’s a dressing for shellfish made with onions and mezcal, a four-ingredient barbecue sauce, and risotto rice that’s baked and rested."

The latest is Mashama Bailey, the chef who owns The Grey in Savannah, Ga., with her business partner, Johno Morisano. (The Grey opened in 2014, and is named for its location in a former Greyhound bus terminal.) Chefs from restaurants in Paris, Mumbai, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile, have been in residence with Intersect’s chef, Nickolas Martinez, and Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, to run its kitchen. But the recent cancellation of indoor dining has finally turned the Intersect’s informal luxury toward takeout and delivery only. The Grey’s three-course menus with sides, $65 per person, plus tax, gratuity and delivery, are posted weekly on Mondays, and available Thursdays through Sundays. Its residency will continue through mid-April. At the Grey, Ms. Bailey, a Bronx native who moved with her family to Savannah in 1980, then back to New York before returning to Savannah, stitches together a personal take on Southern and soul food. This week’s nicely packaged menu features smoked catfish with rye crackers, yardbird chicken with captain sauce, and devil’s food cake. Leeks vinaigrette, red snapper and butterscotch cream will be served next week, and, the week after, there will be crab Louis, smoked lamb and a brown-butter fritter. Southern-style cocktails will also be sold. Intersect, which has a program of culinary training for formerly incarcerated youth, is donating 500 meals to health care workers. (Opens Thursday) "

Not just snow: “The Trapper” (1921) by Rockwell Kent also depicts a lone man; a dog; mountains, clouds, and sky; a pale half-moon. But it was the snow, along with the blue shadows graphed over it, that gripped me. In the dimly lit room (its dimness exacerbated by the over-bright sun outside) the whole painting seemed to glow. I couldn’t stop looking. The winter of 2019 would prove to be one of the warmest on record, during which only 4.8 inches of snow would fall. Stumbling on Kent’s painting felt like unearthing a picture of a lost loved one: the recognition, the elation, the grief. Yet I only wanted more. My daughter had asked that morning if it would ever snow again. I knew it would, but I also knew that, here and elsewhere, it will snow less. In northern Europe snow festivals had been canceled. In Hokkaido, Japan, snow had been imported by truck. Always traced with ephemerality — the snow likely melted before the rendering was done — paintings of snow now record a double evanescence."

Although the pandemic canceled the festival in May, in June the Cannes programmers announced “True Mothers” as an official selection of the event-that-wasn’t (and later screened it at a mini-festival in October).

"A Famous Prada Print, Back With a Twist",2021-01-28,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Textiles']","Inspired by Formica-tiled countertops from the 1950s, one of the motifs from the brand’s spring 1996 show has been put to new use.","Cartoon bananas, Surrealist lips, apocalyptic Hawaiian florals, kitschy tail fins with flames — Miuccia Prada is known for her eccentric prints and patterns. Another iconic motif arrived 25 years ago with Prada’s spring 1996 collection, arguably one of the designer’s most influential. Dubbed Banal Eccentricity — the show notes cited a 1980 exhibition at the Venice Biennale featuring mass-produced ordinary household objects — it hewed to a palette of avocado greens, rusty ochers and eggplant purples, which featured on solid-colored minimalist pieces and those with squiggly, hand-scribbled plaids that took cues from midcentury wallpaper and kitchen design. Another print — which was composed of overlapping abstract squares inspired by 1950s Formica-tiled countertops and appeared on gabardine midlength overcoats and pencil skirts — became synonymous with the concept of ugly chic. If that now seems like an overused descriptor, revisiting the collection is a reminder of the brand’s ever-prescient vision. Ushered onto the runway by a waifish brigade that included Kate Moss and a pixie-haired Carolyn Murphy, it stood in stark contrast to the slick sexiness of Armani and Tom Ford’s Gucci — and it subverted traditional notions of good taste, and even earned comparisons to Dior’s New Look. “If I have done anything, it was making ugly cool,” Mrs. Prada herself once said. “Ugly is attractive, ugly is exciting.”"
