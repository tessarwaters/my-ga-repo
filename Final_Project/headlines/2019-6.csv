Even the phone number is the same. “In building Pastis, I’ve tried to capture the spirit of the original more than build a replica of it,” Mr. McNally wrote in an email. This time around, he has a partner, the restaurateur Stephen Starr, a good thing because as hands-on as Mr. McNally can be, he had a stroke two years ago. Mr. McNally said that, despite the “awful effects” of the stroke, he is very much involved. “He designed the restaurant and has been here constantly,” Mr. Starr said. The larger space, which cost $8 million to build, is configured differently from the original. The money is on the art, media and fashion world to return. “My ideal clientele would be layabouts, prostitutes and ex-cons, but we’ll probably attract models, writers and a few judges,” Mr. McNally said. The restaurant, which has already been besieged by reservation-seekers, will also attract people to the area, now home to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the High Line and top-shelf boutiques. About half of the menu is the same, serving escargots, onion soup gratinée, salade niçoise, steak-frites, mussels and, on Fridays, bouillabaisse.

"T Suggests: English Roses, a Lost Film by Claire Denis and More",2019-06-07,article,News,,"['Art', 'Music', 'Flowers and Plants', 'Photography', 'Folk Music']",A roundup of things our editors — and a few contributors — are excited about in a given week.,"The photographer Luke Stephenson is a self-proclaimed nosy person. His curiosity has led him to capture some fairly esoteric subjects, like the parakeets (“budgies”) raised competitively among a subset of mostly older male Britons, and something called the “Clown Egg Register,” a collection of over 250 eggs painted to look like clowns and owned by Clowns International, a society established in London over half a century ago. Of his anthropological approach, Stephenson explains, “I really enjoy the challenge of discovering the best people to speak to who can open the right doors.” Recently, he trained his lens on the English rose, a flower bred by the renowned British horticulturist David Austin in the 1960s. Austin died earlier this year, but today, more than 150 strains of his English rose are commercially available, each with a name selected by Austin himself. “David was always very fussy about the names he chose for his roses,” explains Michael Marriott, the senior rosarian at David Austin Roses. “He used to say that giving a rose a bad name was the easiest way to kill it. He liked to choose names that were very English, names that immediately evoked Britishness.” The Anne Boleyn, the Dame Judi Dench and the Maid Marion are just a few of the varieties that appear in Stephenson’s new book, “The English Rose.” Each flower is documented in Stephenson’s signature style — a single specimen against a brightly colored backdrop — creating a pop version of an 18th-century nature Wunderkammer. Stephenson continues to focus on singularities of British culture because, he says, “I have lived on this little island all my life, and I like to think I understand it, so I seek out these little oddities. I want to discover more.” “The English Rose” is available to purchase at lukestephenson.com, with prints from the series available at the Photographers’ Gallery, 16-18 Ramillies Street, London, thephotographersgallery.org. — JAMIE SIMS"

The first season of this drama series transported viewers into the underground ball culture of 1980s New York, set against the backdrop of the AIDS crisis. With the encouragement of the ball master of ceremonies Pray Tell (Billy Porter), Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) broke away from Elektra (Dominique Jackson) and her team, or “house,” to form her own, the house of Evangelista. She took in an aspiring model (Indya Moore) and a dancer with showstopping moves (Ryan Jamaal Swain), and her house eventually dominated the competitions. But Blanca’s H.I.V. diagnosis lurked beneath that success. Season 2 jumps to 1990: The ball scene, which was founded by L.G.B.T.Q. people of color, has gone mainstream; Blanca tries to balance starting a new business venture with managing her health; and Pray turns to activism to raise awareness about AIDS."

A Glimpse of Virginia Woolf’s Original Manuscript for ‘Mrs. Dalloway’,2019-06-14,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Manuscripts']","Before Woolf settled on the unique perspective for her modernist masterpiece, she had a more expansive, though traditional, book in mind — “The Hours.”","“I am the only woman in England free to write what I like,” Virginia Woolf wrote in her diary in 1925, the year she published her fourth novel. Thanks to a new reproduction of the only full draft of MRS. DALLOWAY (SP Books, $220), handwritten in three notebooks and initially titled “The Hours,” we now know that the story she completed — about a day in the life of a London housewife planning a dinner party — was a far cry from the one she’d set out to write. The novel we know today begins with the iconic sentence “Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.” But a manuscript page dated June 1923 bears a different opening: “In Westminster, where temples, meeting houses, conventicles, & steeples of all kinds are congregated together, there is at all hours & halfhours, a round of bells, correcting each other, asseverating that time has come a little earlier, or stayed a little later, here or here.” Woolf began writing a “big book about London after World War I,” said Michael Cunningham, whose Pulitzer-winning novel “The Hours” was based on Woolf’s. But “she didn’t go very far with that before she appears to have realized that the ‘big’ book she thought she should write was not really the book she wanted to write. The transition for her was understanding that a book about an outwardly ordinary woman on an ordinary day in London could be every bit as ‘big’ as the books about wars and revolutions.” Rather than one of many minor threads, as Woolf initially planned, Mrs. Dalloway’s became the entire story."

It’s a capacious book, moving freely from Walter Benjamin to the TV soap “Dynasty”; from the “metaphysics” of Marie Kondo to Heidegger’s consideration of the question “What is a thing?” Below, Scott talks about Brexit, influencers, how our feelings have become big business and more."

How do we maximize them for good?,"Over the past two decades, the philosopher David Chalmers has established himself as a leading thinker on consciousness. He began his academic career in mathematics but slowly migrated toward cognitive science and philosophy of mind. He eventually landed at Indiana University working under the guidance of Douglas Hofstadter, whose influential book “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid” had earned him a Pulitzer Prize. Chalmers’s dissertation, “Toward a Theory of Consciousness,” grew into his first book, “The Conscious Mind” (1996), which helped revive the philosophical conversation on consciousness. Perhaps his best-known contribution to philosophy is “the hard problem of consciousness” — the problem of explaining subjective experience, the inner movie playing in every human mind, which in Chalmers’s words will “persist even when the performance of all the relevant functions is explained.”"

‘Billboard’ Review: An Underdog Story Misses the Mark,2019-06-20,article,Review,,['Movies'],Zeke Zelker’s film about a radio promotional stunt gone awry suffers from awkward pacing and stilted dialogue.,"The premise of the new film “Billboard,” written and directed by Zeke Zelker, is deceptively innocuous.

One could conceivably craft a Capra-esque, scrappy-underdog crowd-pleaser here, or a parable on the excesses of capitalism. But the movie misses both marks, widely.

She wears a plain black robe with an ornate lace collar and occasionally slides on a pair of unrimmed glasses to look over legal documents. But all of it — the eyes, the brows, the lips, the face — has always been framed by a round pixie bob, virtually unchanged since the Clinton administration.

Perhaps it was because she shifted her practice slightly later in life that she was able to make inventive work up until the end of it (the artist died last year). “Shadows and Silhouettes,” opening next week at David Kordansky Gallery, in Los Angeles, picks up about where the Met show left off, with 12 Woodman works that date from 2008 to 2016. Most compelling are those that combine painted canvas and glazed earthenware — it’s as though the clay elements of Woodman’s imagined interiors refused to be merely depicted and decided to burst through the works’ surfaces. In “Tuesday Afternoon” (2016), a three-dimensional vase sits just in front of a canvas, its form echoed in the painting by a blank space like a cutout, or a phantom of what once was. “It’s a kind of mysterious move that started to crop up in some of the late paintings,” says Stuart Krimko, the gallery’s research and editorial director. “The vessels become like characters, and the relationship between the vessel and the figure becomes more psychologically charged.” "
