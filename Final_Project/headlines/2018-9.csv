11 New Books We Recommend This Week,2018-09-06,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Identity — whatever that even means — has been having a moment, lately. The political climate forces us all to decide grimly what bunker will welcome us, and the new culture wars spur people to define themselves before somebody else does it for them to possibly violent effect. Identity may be abstract and elusive, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have real-world consequences. So our recommended titles this week turn a spotlight on the subject, from Francis Fukuyama’s “Identity” to Kwame Anthony Appiah’s “The Lies That Bind” to two books about identity politics on college campuses: “The Splintering of the American Mind,” by William Egginton, and “The Coddling of the American Mind,” by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt. (Those similar titles are no coincidence: Both books hark back to Allan Bloom’s classic “The Closing of the American Mind.”) We also have a book about the Spanish man who for decades falsely claimed to be a Holocaust survivor, and a joint biography of the mother and daughter who gave their names to the Myers-Briggs personality test. In other realms, there’s a biography of the tennis legend Arthur Ashe; new fiction from Gary Shteyngart, Ben Marcus and Tsitsi Dangarembga; and an essay collection about the role of the “dead girl” in popular culture, which posits that — in that case, anyway — the absence of identity is the whole point."

His parents organized family trips to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where the young art aficionado teared up the first time he saw a room full of pieces by Alexander Calder. Now 24, Baldwin will debut his first ready-to-wear collection during New York fashion week, inspired by his memories of these expeditions. “Spring 2019 is from the perspective of myself as a child, dreaming after an art museum visit,” Baldwin says. “The collection seeks to replicate that childhood experience of first encountering the color field paintings of Brice Marden and Ellsworth Kelly.” Baldwin originally studied sculpture at the Cleveland Institute of Art and landed an apprenticeship in 2013 with the milliner Marta Glazen. “I became interested in headwear as a form of intimate sculpture on the body,” he says. When he moved to New York City in 2015, he made custom headwear on his own for clients such as Lady Gaga, MAC and Barneys New York, and later for fashion brands such as Adam Selman and Polo Ralph Lauren. Making so many hats for so many labels, Baldwin wanted to finally create a brand under his vision. This coming collection, his first foray into ready-to-wear, will include a moiré evening vest based on a small drawing by Ellsworth Kelly, a silk organza trench coat and, of course, beautiful headwear to top it all off.

Renouncing Hate: What Happens When a White Nationalist Repents,2018-09-10,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Whites', 'Fringe Groups and Movements']","Wes Enzinna considers “Rising Out of Hatred,” by Eli Saslow, in the context of other recent narratives about extremists who changed their minds.","Americans love redemption stories. The Old Testament tale of Exodus — the slaves’ flight from Egypt and their salvation in the desert — may be the most epic of all such sagas, and the Puritans aboard the Mayflower thought of their flight from King James as an exodus of the chosen people fleeing their pharaoh. Ben Franklin’s best-selling “Autobiography” mythologized his rags-to-riches rise from indentured servant to inventor and statesman, and in so doing he further stitched the redemption narrative into the nation’s moral fabric. Since then, activists, politicians and businessmen have all borrowed the story line to lend legitimacy to their ambitions, but few have done so more powerfully than civil rights leaders: Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that Christians who had succumbed to bigotry could repent only by righting racial wrongs; Malcolm X recounted his transformation from hustler and felon to militant activist and Muslim, and in so doing, he invited a nation of sinners to follow him down the same spiritual path. In America, the resurrected wretch (“I once was lost but now am found”) has more authority than the pious innocent — to have fallen and been redeemed is an act of self-invention and moral fortitude that mirrors the Pilgrims’ own impossible journey."

From the back, where its red exoskeleton is exposed, it resembles a birdcage.

How Sardinian Weaving Nearly Became a Lost Art,2018-09-13,article,News,,"['Textiles', 'Women and Girls', 'Rural Areas']","There are some traditions that are universal. Here, we highlight a single craft — and how it’s being adapted, rethought and remade for the 21st century.","WHEN ISABELLA FRONGIA, 61, perhaps the most gifted weaver in Samugheo, the Sardinian town best known for its textiles, was a little girl, she would watch her mother, Susanna, work for hours at her loom. Located in the entry hall, the loom had been built of oak and chestnut by a local carpenter, and its squared edges had long ago gone smooth to the touch. Susanna, who is now 86, would sit before it, raising alternate strings attached to bamboo poles by pressing on the wooden pedals at her feet. She would send a bobbin of weft thread gliding across the horizontal surface of the remaining strings, strung taut in the loom’s belly, before yanking a heavy hinged wood batten with metal teeth toward herself, locking each new row into the others. This simple gesture — passing a weft thread through a base of stable warp threads — is the same for every piece of cloth ever woven. And on this loom, Susanna made everything the family needed, from bedcovers, blankets and towels to the wool textiles laid atop wood chests and the saddlebags slung over the backs of donkeys or men to transport things. Each piece was crafted according to designs and patterns stored in an unwritten repository of techniques and styles, many unique to the island, which over centuries had been passed through the hands of Sardinia’s women."

"In These Romance Novels, the Characters Are Sexy, Hot and Toting a Ton of Emotional Baggage",2018-09-20,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"All romance novels have happy endings. How they get there, though, is a lot more interesting when the protagonists must grapple with personal shortcomings.","Every romance novel is a kind of fantasy, whether it features an impossibly wealthy duke or a cute guy who knows how to talk about his feelings. It can be escapist or aspirational, extravagantly hyperbolic or easily plausible, but it’s still idealized. Every romance has a happy ending, after all. That’s a narrative constraint and a defining characteristic of the genre; it’s also a puzzle for an author to solve. Make your main characters too good or too perfect, and obstacles to their happy ending seem far-fetched. Make them too flawed, and maybe they don’t deserve a happy ending. Here are five new romances that grapple with their protagonists’ shortcomings and virtues — their worthiness of a happy ending — or at least leave their readers doing so after the final page. "

Staged at the Galerie de Botanique in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, the event effectively rebranded the fashion houses’s men’s line, and caused a seismic shift in the typically staid world of men’s fashion. At a time when baggy tailoring was the prevailing aesthetic in men’s wear, a relative newcomer made a case for a precisely crafted razor-slim silhouette. The Times’s fashion critic at the time, Cathy Horyn, singled it out as “the most anticipated show of the fall 2001 men’s season.” Tomorrow, some 17 years later, Slimane will make another buzzy debut, unveiling his first collection for Celine as the French brand’s artistic, creative and image director, a role created specifically for him. Since his arrival at Celine in January — where he took over from Phoebe Philo, who announced her departure last year — Slimane has been remaking the house in his own image. When the brand introduces men’s wear for the first time this season, with couture to follow next January, Slimane will showcase not only his sprawling powers of imagination but also what he is capable of when starting from a blank slate."

"Original, Handwritten Manuscripts of ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’",2018-09-28,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],An earlier version of Oscar Wilde’s controversial novel contains homoerotic undertones which he edited out for the final book.,"“He can write for none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys,” one critic wrote of Oscar Wilde in The Scots Observer in July 1890, responding to the first serialization of “The Picture of Dorian Gray” in Lippincott’s Magazine. This was just one of “hundreds of entries of vituperation in the press when it came out,” Wilde’s grandson Merlin Holland recently told The Times, and Wilde spent the next year revising his aestheticist tale of a double life for publication in book form, removing certain homoerotic passages. A new book of Wilde’s handwritten manuscripts, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (SP Books, $250), grants readers unfiltered access to lines of pure, unadulterated affection that the author was compelled to omit if he ever wanted the story to become the literary success it did. “It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance than a man should ever give to a friend,” the painter Basil tells Dorian in the magazine edition, but not the final novel. “Somehow I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. … I quite admit that I adore you madly, extravagantly, absurdly.” Such sentences led Lippincott’s readers to deem this, in Holland’s words, “a disgusting, sodomitical novel.” (He added that the full text would later be used in court as “circumstantial proof that Wilde was homosexual” — a charge that sent him to prison.) Holland, who wrote the new book’s foreword, considers this “the urtext of ‘Dorian Gray,’” revealing raw passions the writer intended to evoke before the world was yet ready to read them. “He was standing up for his right as an artist to write about whatever he pleased,” Holland said of his grandfather. “He had the right to create the characters he wanted to create.”"
