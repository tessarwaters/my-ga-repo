Makie, her tiny SoHo clothing shop, is a secret address whispered from one stylish mother to another; its signature wrapping (a brown paper box tied with colorful ribbon and neon-hued feathers) is almost as famous as Yahagi’s elegant, minimalist and cozy kid’s wear: onesies, cashmere sweaters and bibs in sophisticated, adult shades of slate, mouse gray and stone white. In 1991, at the age of 23, Yahagi left Japan for New York City, where she opened a bakery with her then-husband near Union Square. But an old issue of Vogue Bambini inspired a new direction. “It had these timeless images of kids in outfits by Comme des Garçons that looked like wonderful school uniforms and papa’s clothes,” she remembers; she set up her shop eight years later. There, hidden like little treasures among her garments, is a selection of carefully chosen housewares — paper-thin Japanese terry cloth towels, striped porcelain bowls — that she finds on her monthly trips to Paris and Tokyo, where she also maintains a larger Makie outpost. On the days she isn’t traveling, you’ll find the 53-year-old flitting about her Thompson Street location, dressed in her signature uniform: a navy frayed-twill blazer and cropped trousers of her own design, plus a stack of gold-and-opal rings.

Any connection between this new restaurant and the space’s former tenant, Brasserie, is tenuous. Jeff Zalaznick, a co-owner, is instead calling it a Japanese brasserie. “I love the name, and it reminds me of places in Japan with similar names,” he said. The Lobster Club might suggest Japan to Mr. Zalaznick, but New Yorkers are more likely to remember an Upper East Side restaurant of that name from the chef Anne Rosenzweig. Now Japan prevails, with the chef, Tasuku Murakami, in the kitchen. There is lobster to be sure, seared on a teppan griddle, in a cocktail, a salad, and dumplings. But the menu is as much steakhouse as it is brasserie, with a long list of sushi and sashimi items as well. The restaurant, which cost $10 million to design and build and was done by the designer Peter Marino, who also created the colorful tableware, is as much inviting lounge as it is restaurant. Framed by a long, bright bar along one side with flooring that suggests Jackson Pollock’s work, some of the midcentury Modern style furnishings upholstered in pink and chartreuse are low, conducive to drinking and snacking. Off to one side is another dining room, which can be closed for private parties, done in vibrant red and adorned with Mr. Marino’s interpretations of Picasso sculptures.

The movie is widely considered a classic of contemporary Japanese erotica, but it has always been remarkable to me for its title alone, which seems a perfect expression of the sensations we encounter when we travel somewhere foreign. It’s hardly original to assert that of all the ways we experience place, sight is perhaps the least important; the thing that convinces me I’m actually in Japan, for example, is never the slur of neon outside the Tokyo-bound train’s windows, but the perfume of soy sauce, cooking oil and burning cedar that is particular to the country. The same is true with Delhi: You step through the airport doors, and there it is — singed rubber, wet concrete, damp loam, roasting cardamom. These days, thanks to the ongoing globalization (or democratization, depending on your perspective) of fashion and music, many cities can look, and sound, very much alike. But a place’s fragrance is inimitable, a visceral biography of its cuisine, places of worship and landscape."

He lives in the street and yearns to move silently among people who don’t recognize him.” Below, Mr. Smith talks about first learning of Mr. Frank in a rock magazine in the 1970s, how “American Witness” became darker and more ambiguous as he wrote it, his fascination with one of the Three Stooges, and more."

(Psst … where’s Superman?)","“Justice League,” the newest DC Comics superhero jam directed by Zack Snyder, is looser, goosier and certainly more watchable than the last one. The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through."

3 Designers Creating Clothes for Life — Not the Runway,2017-11-15,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Dresses', 'Textiles']","Independent, understated, anonymous, even: A trio of sought-after labels specialize in the sort of thoughtful, well-made garments categorized as slow fashion.","There’s a certain type of woman who is always dressed in something stylish but not fashionable, expensive but never ostentatious, exquisite yet hard to place: some thoughtful, meticulously cut piece of clothing that channels the contemporary moment while remaining aloof to trends. It’s made of pure, papery crisp cotton, supple linen or the softest Italian wool. It’s capacious and effortless, since anything too structured, too clingy or contrived, would be trying too hard. This woman tends to work in a creative field — she’s a chef, a landscape architect, an artist, a curator, an editor — and her personal life, too, has a certain ease. She spends weekends in the garden and throws impromptu dinner parties and would rather wear a roomy dress than forgo a homemade piece of rhubarb pie. You’ll never see her wearing visible logos (or even identifiable trends), but if you ask her what she’s wearing, she’ll likely name one of a cohort of independent designers who have built a business for themselves, in some cases over decades, by quietly and consistently working outside the realm of mainstream luxury fashion. These designers don’t hold runway shows on the fashion-week schedule ... if they hold them at all. They don’t advertise or market themselves. Most of them avoid press entirely. (You get the sense that promotion, like tight clothes, would be in poor taste.)"

"‘Law & Order True Crime’ Season 1, Episode 8: The Sins of the Fathers",2017-11-15,article,Review,,['Television'],"The season ended by expanding the notion that killers are made, not born.","Why do people kill other people? Circumstantially, they have countless reasons, as the Menendez brothers had theirs. But as the Pulitzer-winning writer Richard Rhodes argues in his book “Why They Kill,” the popular notion that any regular person is capable of killing under the right circumstances is likely false — it takes a lot to turn someone into a killer. Even seemingly obvious exceptions dissolve under scrutiny. Pointing to a study of 27,574 muskets recovered from the battlefield at Gettysburg, Rhodes notes that nearly 90 percent of the weapons, which are muzzle-loaded and fired one round at a time, were found still loaded. Over 12,000 of them were found still packed with more than one musket ball, some with as many as ten. It’s one thing to load a weapon — no one wants to look like a coward in battle. It’s another to actually look in someone’s eyes and shoot him."

That’s thanks largely to Brazile’s vantage as interim head of the Democratic National Committee, struggling to unite fractured and fractious constituents on the left. (Spoiler alert: It didn’t work.) So it’s not surprising that she would offer her own take on what happened last fall — or that it would diverge from Clinton’s “What Happened,” which mentions Brazile only in passing and is No. 12 in its ninth week on the hardcover nonfiction list. Brazile’s memoir-slash-analysis, the cleverly titled “Hacks,” debuts at No. 6 and claims that Brazile knew all along Clinton was in trouble. “The polls were unanimous in her winning,” she writes, but “I did not trust the polls. … I had visited states around the country and I found a lack of enthusiasm for her everywhere.” Brazile says she urged Bernie Sanders to “work as hard as he could to bring his supporters into the fold with Hillary, and to campaign with all the heart and hope he could muster. He might find some of her positions too centrist, and her coziness with the financial elites distasteful, but he knew and I knew that the alternative was a person who would put the very future of the country in peril.”"

First, locate the tooth. Pick it up carefully, touching only the shiny crown and not the bloody root. “Don’t put it in your purse or in your pocket,” Solmundson says. Adults and children old enough to avoid accidentally swallowing a tooth — every year in the United States, more than five million of them are knocked out — can keep it tucked inside their cheek.

What was good about the Vanity Fair era was that I wrote so much. These days, the only place I really do my diary is on my laptop on a plane back from Davos or L.A. or London. But back in the pre-digital age, I had those black-and-white marbled composition notebooks and new New Yorker eyes (because I’d just arrived from London) and I was so wired with everything I was seeing that I had a desire to write it, share it, impart it. I love reading other people’s diaries, too: Virginia Woolf’s, Andy Cohen’s. Chips Channon was a huge inspiration to me; the Tory M.P.’s diaries through the ’30s and ’40s where he interfaced between society and politics — it’s just riveting stuff. As for myself, I’m at my most prolific when something new is happening and I’m on my own somewhere. There’s nothing like that caught-in-the-moment, onrushing immediacy of a diary.

My family and I had arrived there — having flown in from London the night before — by public bus from the busy terminal outside Valletta’s gates, along with a few taciturn locals bearing bouquets of flowers, presumably heading to Sunday lunch with relatives in the adjacent modern town of Rabat, and a gaggle of chatty Italians, keen, like ourselves, to visit the so-called “silent city.” And indeed, on this July afternoon, as the black-clad priest and his caretaker padlocked the vast doors of St. Paul’s Cathedral, passed us with their heads bowed and scurried away into the tiny city’s sun-washed maze, the streets were silent except for us, the tourists. The occasional decorated horse clopped by, pulling British or Italians upon a painted cart. Our own footsteps echoed in the silent canyons between cloistered monasteries, convents and private houses, until we rounded a corner into a square near the Carmelite Priory and were suddenly surrounded by young visitors buying trinkets and postcards, taking photographs, swigging, in the heat, from sweating plastic water bottles. A block farther on, all was quiet again. This small, perfect town felt as if I’d dreamed it, a hermetic Mediterranean fantasy, a curious and singular combination of Arab influence and profound Catholicism, the stretching vista of sandy earth and olive trees descending to the impeccable azure sea, punctuated by an occasional British red postbox."

I inherited both the passion and a large part of my collection from my inimitable Aunt Sue, the best library scavenger in the family. I think the first I ever received was a 1949 number called “Marcia: Private Secretary,” by the memorably named Zillah MacDonald; it dealt with government espionage and, if memory serves, the plot turned on watermarks.
