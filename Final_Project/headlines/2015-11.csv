If their funnel-shaped Gemini spacecraft doesn’t spring a leak, Air Force Maj. Frank Borman and his co-pilot, Navy Lt. Cmdr. James Lovell, intend to doff their silver spacesuits and continue the 14-day flight in regulation Air Force long johns.

Behind the change in plans is the absolute confidence that Gemini’s pressure hull will not expose the astronauts to the vacuum of space. If it did collide with a meteoroid or suffered explosive decompression for some other reason, the astronauts would pass out in less than a minute. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 2, 1965"

"‘Winter Is Coming,’ by Garry Kasparov",2015-11-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Kasparov makes his case against the Putin presidency and points to the West’s role in his rule.,"Russians in positions of power tend to measure their country’s standing in the world against the United States, longing to be recognized as equally important and powerful and getting very angry when they’re not so treated. President Vladimir Putin has made victimhood at America’s hands a leitmotif of his reign, and many Russians have bought into his claim that Washington tirelessly seeks ways to weaken, impoverish and otherwise humiliate their country. Many critics of Putin, in Russia and in the West, similarly hold that Washington’s treatment of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union was disdainful and thus undermined embryonic moves toward democracy, contributing to the rise of Putinism."

It takes place in Dresden in the fall of 1989, in the dying days of East Germany, on the night that thousands of protesters stormed the city’s Stasi headquarters. Once they were done ransacking the offices that had inspired so much terror, they directed their anger down the street toward the K.G.B. residence where Lieutenant Colonel Putin, a young intelligence officer, stood looking out the window. Watching the approaching mob, Putin called the local Soviet military command and asked for reinforcements. But no higher authority would approve it. “Moscow is silent,” he was told."
Michel Houellebecq’s ‘Submission’,2015-11-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Karl Ove Knausgaard reviews Michel Houellebecq’s new novel, which imagines France as a Muslim state in 2022.","Before I begin this review, I have to make a small confession. I have never read Michel Houellebecq’s books. This is odd, I concede, since Houellebecq is considered a great contemporary author, and one cannot be said to be keeping abreast of contemporary literature without reading his work. His books have been recommended to me ever since 1998, most often “The Elementary Particles,” by one friend in particular, who says the same thing every time I see him. You have to read “The Elementary Particles,” he tells me, it’s awesome, the best book I’ve ever read. Several times I’ve been on the verge of heeding his advice, plucking “The Elementary Particles” from its place on my shelf and considering it for a while, though always returning it unread. The resistance to starting a book by Houellebecq is too great. I’m not entirely sure where it comes from, though I do have a suspicion, because the same thing goes for the films of Lars von Trier: When “Antichrist” came out I couldn’t bring myself to see it, neither in the cinema nor at home on the DVD I eventually bought, which remains in its box unwatched. They’re simply too good. What prevents me from reading Houellebecq and watching von Trier is a kind of envy — not that I begrudge them success, but by reading the books and watching the films I would be reminded of how excellent a work of art can be, and of how far beneath that level my own work is. Such a reminder, which can be crushing, is something I shield myself from by ignoring Houellebecq’s books and von Trier’s films. That may sound strange, and yet it can hardly be unusual. If you’re a carpenter, for instance, and you keep hearing about the amazing work of another carpenter, you’re not necessarily going to seek it out, because what would be the good of having it confirmed that there is a level of excellence to which you may never aspire? Better to close your eyes and carry on with your own work, pretending the master carpenter doesn’t exist."

The show came to represent the brewing movement of image-based artists — those who “had a broader perspective of how we read images, and really entered the picture again, and what that means,” Brauntuch says. “Pictures” operated as a bellwether, in stark contrast to then-fashionable Minimalism and abstraction. “We came out of a time when ‘art’ was not what we were doing, which is why we were doing what we were doing.” His years in New York in the late ’70s and 1980s were spent running up the ladder alongside his friends, like Cindy Sherman, Matt Mullican, David Salle, Goldstein and Longo, whose careers exploded onto the superstar level. He counted Richard Prince and Dike Blair among his golfing buddies, too. “We played religiously,” Brauntuch says. “We also played in a poker game for decades.”"

We mostly just love our dog. What do you think? C. S., Portland, Ore."

More than 50 percent of those refugees are children, the highest figure for child refugees in more than a decade. Chuol, Hana and Oleg — the children featured in the New York Times Magazine article “The Displaced” — are three young refugees who were forced to leave everything behind because of violence, conflict and persecution."
The Displaced: Oleg,2015-11-05,article,News,,"['Refugees and Displaced Persons', 'Children and Childhood']","At 11, he is living in the ruins of his former life.","Oleg Teryokhin was living with his mother and father in Nikishino, a rural village of fewer than 1,000 coal miners, farmers and their families in eastern Ukraine, when fighting broke out in April 2014. Hastily formed separatist militias, goaded and armed by Moscow, rose up in a rebellion against a new, pro-Western government in Kiev. In the first months of the conflict, the fighting was far from Nikishino, and Oleg, then 10, spent the early summer tearing about the village on his bicycle, zipping past its old brick cottages and apricot orchards. Then, in July, scorched scraps of clothing and bits of paper with foreign writing blew through the village — debris from the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the passenger jet that was shot down, killing hundreds of people whose bodies lay in fields just south of the village. When Oleg carried some of these items home, his mother, Galina, was horrified that the conflict had come so close."

Half are children. This multimedia journey in text, photographs and virtual reality tells the stories of three of them.","I have two photos on my desk. The first shows a child, a girl of about 10. She is standing behind an enormous pile of her family’s belongings, which have been tightly packed for a long journey. Her face is blank with uncertainty, but she strikes a bossy pose — one hand on her hip, the other planted firmly against the bundles. Her companions are an older woman, probably her mother, and a little boy — her younger brother? Both look directly at the photographer, Henri Cartier-Bresson, who took this picture in Dessau, as scores of Germans displaced during World War II began returning home. It is 1945. Where has this girl been, and what has she seen?"
The Displaced: Hana,2015-11-05,article,News,,"['Children and Childhood', 'Refugees and Displaced Persons', 'Middle East and Africa Migrant Crisis']","At 12, she has lived one-quarter of her life in a debilitating state of suspension as a Syrian refugee in Lebanon.","At 4:45 in the morning on a Saturday in early August, stars were still bright in the sky above a refugee settlement in rural Lebanon where Hana Abdullah, a 12-year-old girl from Syria, now lives. The morning call to prayer floated down a dusty road and wound its way around the mostly silent tents. At 5 o’clock, Hana was still sleeping on her bamboo mat by the edge of her family’s tent, her arms folded, her hands under her head. Her baby brother and three of her four sisters slept nearby. Many mornings Hana was up at 4 o’clock. She worked in the nearby fields of Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, picking fruits or vegetables, and everyone started early. But today the truck that would take her there was late. Now came its familiar rumble, next the crunching of gravel: She stirred, her mouth twitched, her eyelids fluttered. Then she was up, vertical in one swift movement, stretching, pulling on a hat from a stash of her belongings. She grabbed lunch — a tomato, and a pita she folded around a potato — and ducked outside to wait on one of the benches in front of her tent."

As more of an amateur in all-things Bond, I had hoped a dirty bomb would go boom or that the actress Léa Seydoux would do something unspeakable to Daniel Craig, given that the pre-credit sequence features female nudes writhing alongside an octopus with busy arms.

When you see them outside of it, in an exhibition, they look totally different.’ And usually, this is true” — though not in the case of Luxembourg & Dayan’s current gathering of her husband’s pieces. The intimate gallery, which is wallpapered and homey, is filled with 50 works by the late artist. Among them is “The Double Grande Jatte,” her husband’s homage to and spin on Georges Seurat’s exercise in pointillism, “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.” Its inclusion represents a reunion for Roberta, who last saw “The Double Grande Jatte” when it was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 1971. “I found it so fresh here,” she remarks. “When he was making it, we were in an apartment in Milan and there was a door between the living room and the studio,” and the 20-foot-long mural ran parallel to the door jambs. “It was in front of us all of the time and at the end, Enrico said, ‘I understand now why Seurat died so young, from getting bored of making all of those points.’” A quip, sure, but fitting for someone consumed by the need for change."

The doctrine goes something like this: Western art of the early 20th century develops in a single direction, toward abstraction. Artists working toward that goal were the true radicals. Those who held onto representation were aesthetic conservatives (whatever their actual politics).Conveniently enough, the artists who broke most definitively with figuration, and who made abstract painting and sculpture into the One True Art, were living in New York — the city that, in the words of the art historian Serge Guilbaut, “stole the idea of Modern art” from Paris after World War II."

"An Old Paris Hotel, in the Hands of a Graffiti Artist",2015-11-06,article,News,,['Hotels and Travel Lodgings'],André Saraiva teamed up with the writers Glenn O’Brien and Olivier Zahm to reimagine the famous Hôtel Grand Amour.,"For nearly a decade, the tiny Hôtel Amour in Paris lured a certain clientele with its disco balls, black walls and phallic furniture. ‘‘There’s never room anymore,’’ says André Saraiva, the graffiti artist, nightlife impresario and co-owner. But with his new Hôtel Grand Amour, a Napoleon III-style building in the 10th Arrondissement with 44 rooms, some featuring libraries ‘‘curated’’ by the fashion writers Glenn O’Brien and Olivier Zahm, and art by the likes of Keith Haring and Petra Collins, he hopes to remedy that. There’s also a spa, a cafe, an upscale brasserie and a cocktail lounge inspired by the Ritz’s Bar Hemingway. ‘‘You could literally never leave,’’ says Saraiva."

Ether seems to be a great surprise to the temperance advocates of to-day, to those who wage war on alcoholic stimulants. Curiously enough, it originated with the great teetotal movement of fifty years ago. "

But long before the Holocaust, the term had a different set of connotations. The Jewish quarters of the great European capitals — Paris’s Marais, Frankfurt’s Judengasse, Amsterdam’s Jodenbuurt — were testaments to the diversity and richness of Jewish life. Often sites of mandated segregation ridden with poverty and plague, they also fostered cultural exchange and intellectual vitality. Nowhere was this more apparent than in Venice, which established one of Europe’s first Jewish ghettos in 1516 in the Cannaregio district, on a small island where the city's cannons had previously been cast: the foundry, or ‘‘geto.’’"

She waded fearlessly into the unknown. When everything is strange and new, minor mysteries (popcorn, tuning forks) carry the same weight as the nonminor mysteries (biology, birth, death and the sometimes lonely in-between). Three new books rely on the supple child mind to help us see the familiar as something wholly new and surprising. Like the farsighted reader who requires distance to see clearly, these books make room for mystery in order to understand the wondrously complex and totally basic bond between children and their parents.

Ivan, the gorilla, frees himself and a young elephant by communicating with humans through finger-painting. “Ivan” was a winning tale for many ­reasons: It was based, loosely, on a true story; it addressed the issue of animal cruelty honestly, but in a manner that children could handle; it was technically original, telling the story from Ivan’s perspective, in short chapters that read like prose poems. But the primary reason “Ivan” has become such a beloved book is Ivan himself. His frank wisdom about life, both human and animal, provokes laughter and thought; his aspirations — to become an artist, and to liberate himself through art — feel universal. "

"‘The Reproach of Hunger,’ by David Rieff",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"An examination of conventional wisdom about world hunger’s causes, and its future.","Hunger is probably the most salient consequence of poverty. This salience has some rationale: Hunger makes food a priority, and poor people spend about half of their income on it. But hunger is, nevertheless, a symptom of poverty, not a problem to be tackled in isolation — the solution to hunger may not have much to do with the supply of food. In this rambling book, David Rieff never quite recognizes this fundamental point. Positing that the 2008 spike in global food prices marked the start of structurally higher prices, his discussion revolves around whether we should look for the solution of extra food production in technocratic philanthropy, global agribusiness or revolutionary politics. Arriving at an answer that none look promising, he asks, “Where does this leave us?”"
"‘Kid Moses,’ by Mark R. Thornton",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A homeless Tanzanian boy leaves Dar es Salaam for the unknown wilderness in this debut novel.,"In the English-speaking world, “safari” evokes gaggles of sunburned tourists in pith helmets, gawking at lions and ­elephants from the safety of open-topped all-terrain vehicles before ending the day with gin and tonics and Instagrams of acacia trees silhouetted against fiery African sunsets. In Swahili, “safari” just means a trip, a plain old trip of any variety."

Putin has also inspired fiction writers, appearing as himself (or in thin disguise) in books by Charles Cumming, Martin Cruz Smith and others. I asked authors with Russian roots why Putin might appeal to novelists."
"‘Becoming Nicole,’ by Amy Ellis Nutt",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A family rises to the challenge when their son insists he is a girl.,"“Becoming Nicole: The Transformation of an American Family,” by Amy Ellis Nutt, generously traces the parameters of parental love. It tells the story of Wayne and Kelly Maines, a good-hearted, hard-working American couple, neither rich nor poor, neither fabulous nor downtrodden, who after years of trying to conceive a baby are finally given the opportunity to adopt: infant boys, identical twins, the children of Kelly’s second cousin. The Maineses name the babies Jonas and Wyatt, and immediately the low expectations that come with unmet yearning give way to the more self-centered aspirations that accompany getting what you want. Fantasies of imprinting upon these inchoate beings a storybook childhood preoccupy both parents, but especially Wayne, who sees in fatherhood a chance at passing down the rites and traditions of American manhood. Still in the hospital, Wayne cradles the babies and murmurs to them as if reciting a prayer: My boys, my boys. “We’re going to have so much fun together,” he whispers in the twins’ ears. “We’re going to go hunting and fishing and I will teach you everything I know.” "
Sonia Manzano’s ‘Becoming Maria’ and Margarita Engle’s ‘Enchanted Air’,2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Look for your life: Two Latina writers explore the experience of finding their own way among multiple cultures.,"From the very first sentence, Margarita Engle’s memoir “Enchanted Air” takes wing. “When my parents met, it was love at first sight,” Engle writes. “They were standing on the terrace of an art school in an elegant palace now known as the Museo Romántico, the Romantic Museum.” Since her Cuban mother and American father did not speak the same language, they “communicated by passing drawings back and forth, like children in the back of a classroom. . . . Sketches, signs and gestures had to substitute for words.”"
"‘Dream On, Amber’ and ‘Full Cicada Moon’",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In two books, biracial girls face an absent father, a cross-country move and the bigotry of those around them.","Children’s literature has been engulfed in a conversation on the lack of books featuring minority characters. This call for diversity has been accompanied by uncomfortable yet necessary debates about what constitutes quality representation, and few people agree on that. Two new novels about biracial girls illustrate the range of approaches authors can take to these issues. "
"Philip C. Stead’s ‘Lenny & Lucy,’ and More",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Imaginary sidekicks help their picture-book friends through tight spots and tough times.,"“It is through fantasy that children achieve catharsis,” Maurice Sendak said when he accepted the Caldecott Medal for “Where the Wild Things Are” in 1964. “It is the best means they have for taming Wild Things.” In four new picture books about imaginary friends, conjured companions of all kinds help children confront the beastly parts of life. In these books, the children’s situations change when they meet real-life friends, but reassuringly, their chimerical pals never disappear."
"‘The Hired Girl,’ by Laura Amy Schlitz",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Escaping a brutal home, this protagonist models herself on inspiring fictional characters.","Surrounded by a brutish father and brothers and aching for her dead mother, 14-year-old Joan Skraggs runs away from her family’s Pennsylvania farm, makes her way to Baltimore, and is rescued from a park bench by a well-dressed young man. She presents herself as Janet Lovelace, age 18, and becomes “the hired girl,” a servant to the Rosenbachs — a prosperous Jewish family who own a department store. It’s 1911, the tail end of the Gilded Age, and world wars have yet to break out. Janet keeps a diary, and the reader quickly gleans that her notions of life come from three books: “Jane Eyre,” “Dombey and Son” and “Ivanhoe.” “I plan to go on as bravely as a heroine in a novel,” she writes. “In my new life I’m not going to be vulgar. Even though I’m going to be a servant I’m going to cultivate my finer feelings. I will better myself and write with truth and refinement.”"
"‘The Rest of Us Just Live Here,’ by Patrick Ness",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A novel plays with Y.A. formulas, keeping the supernaturally special teenagers in the background. ","At my typical public high school in an average-size town, I was surrounded by a lot of kids just like me — that is to say, no one had any special powers. There were no vampires. No witches. No werewolves or shape shifters or zombie fighters. No one was on a mission to save the world from the forces of evil. Mostly, we were learning to drive cars, trying to pass calculus, angling for the first glimmerings of what adult relationships might hold. We were teenagers, for all the beauty and mundanity in that. It was horrible, fantastic, brutal, magical and sometimes utterly boring. It was, in a word, life."
Rick Riordan’s ‘Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard’,2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A novel from the author of the Percy Jackson series uses a boy’s adventure to enter the world of Norse mythology.,"The line between cynical repetition and elegant variation is as fine in adventure stories as it is in — well, as it is in that line the members of Spinal Tap sapiently discovered between clever and stupid. Rick Riordan, after the well-earned triumph of his two Percy Jackson series, tales of an all-American boy who discovers that he is the son of a Greek god, now embarks, with “Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard: The Sword of Summer,” on an entirely new series, this one about a not-quite-all-American boy who discovers he is the son of . . . a Norse god. The boys are certainly different ­— Magnus, our new hero, a Kurt Cobain look-alike, starts out homeless and a petty thief in Boston, where Percy was at boarding school."

"‘Out of Darkness,’ by Ashley Hope Pérez",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Racism, love and friendship power a story that begins with a girl’s pain and ends in a town’s tragedy.","The novels that burn into our minds as young adults often involve horror of some kind. A mere mention of “All Quiet on the Western Front” or “I Am the Cheese,” and I’m right back to brooding again in the ocean-deep emotions of my adolescence. What is that urge, the desire to soak in anguish and injustice as we come of age? Whatever it is, Ashley Hope Pérez’s new novel, “Out of Darkness,” fills the need. Her layered tale of color lines, love and struggle in an East Texas oil town is a pit-in-the-stomach family drama that goes down like it should, with pain and fascination, like a mix of sugary medicine and artisanal moonshine. I actually had to close the book at one point to seek respite with Facebook. And puppies."
"‘The League of Unexceptional Children,’ by Gitty Daneshvari",2015-11-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A middle-grade novel invents a spy network of children so ordinary they can carry out their mission without being noticed.,"The cloak of American exceptionalism wears some permanent stains down its front — like slavery and the denial of civil rights. And fresh stains, too, like exaggerated income inequality. Likewise, the reality of the elite, exceptional American child is hardly as pristine as many parents imagine. Our “gifted and talented” Mandarin-speaking, travel-team-­captaining, polished-in-selfies youth are often characterized by narcissism, the pursuit of achievement at any cost, toxic stress and greed: grade greed, accomplishment greed, résumé greed. Precocious superstardom is not always happy. And regular, average childhood is not necessarily a problem that needs fixing. "

Backyards, driveways and rooftops take cover under white and everything is changed. Snow means gloves and boots and anticipation. It doubles your speed downhill, then cushions your fall at the bottom. It makes it much harder for school buses to reach their destination. But as three new books show, our captivation lies in something more than the break from routine and the opportunity for daredevil stunts. We make snowmen, we make angels, we build fortresses and we leave our footsteps wherever we go. After it snows, we sculpture the world around us, carving out stages upon which our imaginations perform. "
Steve Sheinkin’s ‘Most Dangerous’,2015-11-06,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Vietnam War']",An account of Daniel Ellsberg and his release of the Pentagon Papers introduces young readers to the Vietnam War. ,"About 70 pages into his gripping new history for young readers, “Most Dangerous: Daniel Ellsberg and the Secret History of the Vietnam War,” Steve Sheinkin seems to switch genres, describing a scene that could have been taken from “The Walking Dead”: a trailer full of corpses, its floor “streaked with blood and brains.” Arms and legs were falling off the rotting trunks, which made it difficult to count how many bodies were in the trailer. The stench was unbearable. So the bodies were hosed down and the trailer tipped to its side, letting, as one witness put it, a “rivulet of blood-colored water” flow outside. A delegation of American military officers passed by, stepping over the blood “to avoid ruining the shine on their boots.” "

In a profile last year, The Telegraph noted that Cornwell has “the coiled-up, fight-or-flight air of a lynx about to spring,” a trait evident on her website’s home page, where a video shows her coolly handling an MP5 submachine gun. “I can’t imagine writing about a certain type of rifle or a type of shotgun or a certain handgun for anything, and not having any experience with it,” she explains in the video. Cornwell has been known to take her research to extremes: She spent six years in a forensics lab to learn Scarpetta’s job and went on to scuba dive, fly a helicopter and stab sides of beef wrapped in wool, all in the name of getting things right. “People now have such short attention spans that I have to try really hard to keep the suspense going, so they don’t have a reason to put down my book and read 20,000 tweets instead,” Cornwell told The Telegraph. “Crime novels are a great excuse to get people together and to . . . examine issues that affect us all,” she added. “The crime is just the party to get the people to show up.”"

Chemezov, Russia’s chief arms trade executive, provided no delivery date or any other details.","Russia’s most senior arms executive said Monday that a contract to supply Iran with powerful S-300 air defense missiles was now active. But with no delivery date or any other details, the announcement seemed aimed more at warding off an Iranian lawsuit than a major step toward delivery of the weapon system. Sergei V. Chemezov, Russia’s chief arms trade executive, made the announcement at an air show in Dubai, Russian news agencies reported. “The contract to deliver the S-300 was not only signed by both sides, but has already come into force,” Mr. Chemezov was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. The initial contract to deliver the weapons was signed in 2007, before the current international arms embargo against Iran was established. But the deal was canceled in 2010 by Dmitri A. Medvedev, then Russia’s president, under pressure from the United States and Israel. In response, Iran filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract that could cost Moscow as much as five times the $800 million value of the original deal. President Vladimir V. Putin reversed Mr. Medvedev’s decision in April, as a nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers began to appear likely. But the system still has not been delivered. The hitch, military experts say, is that Russia wants to keep the unfulfilled contract as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, perhaps with an eye to ending economic sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine.

The snow did not melt, and in the years that followed, storms brought even more. All around Greenland, the arctic temperatures remained low enough for the snow to last past spring and summer. It piled up, year after year, century after century, millennium after millennium.

Meanwhile, in Antarctica, a similar process was well underway. There, as snow fell upon snow for years without end, the ice sheet spread out over a much vaster area: 5.4 million square miles, an expanse far larger than the lower 48 states. By the start of the modern era, when power plants and electric lights began illuminating the streets of Manhattan, about 75 percent of the world’s freshwater had been frozen into the ice sheets that lay over these lands at opposite ends of the earth."

By the time he died from an overdose in 2009 at the age of 27, he had come to stand almost single-handedly for a downtown New York art and party scene that arose just before 9/11 and flourished in the anxious years afterward, known for its drug-fueled excess and adolescent rebellion in the face of a city rapidly becoming more homogeneous, wealth-obsessed and heavily policed. That Mr. Snow came from art-world privilege — he was an estranged member of the de Menil collecting family — made the narrative that grew up around him all the more loaded. He was resented, glorified, dismissed and envied, often in the space of a single conversation, regarded as a genuinely troubled, politically aware poet of early 21st-century anomie or a heavily tattooed epigone of a counterculture that lost its steam long before his arrival."

These grim scenes, filmed in shades of brown and gray, suggest the combination of fear, exhaustion and uncertainty in people at the mercy of an impersonal bureaucracy that shuffles them from place to place. But the movie never bothers to show you life inside a shelter dormitory or tries to convey a broader vision of the city’s street culture.

We may never stop elegizing the meatpacking district’s Florent and the fiery, diminished downtown bohemia the restaurant represented, but few of us miss coughing into a slab of bavette, whether it was because we ourselves were smoking or because the guy next to us, looking like Michel Houellebecq, was lifting a match to his fifth American Spirit. When the smoking prohibition took effect, fatalists predicted the decline of eating out, the end of fun, the death of the city. Revelry persevered."

1940: Britain Smashes Italy’s Ships,2015-11-13,article,News,,['World War II (1939-45)'],From the International Herald Tribune archives: The British cripple the Italian Navy in 1940.,"LONDON — In one bold raid delivered Monday night [Nov. 12] by its sea-borne bombers, the British fleet in the Mediterranean crippled at least two and probably three of the Italian Navy’s six battleships and put out of action two cruisers and several auxiliary vessels as they lay comfortably behind shore batteries of the naval stronghold of Taranto, on the heel of the Italian boot. This decisive blow, which immediately tipped the balance of Mediterranean naval strength in favor of the British, was announced to a wildly cheering House of Commons this morning by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 14, 1940"

Inside the List,2015-11-13,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Donald Trump and Ben Carson are duking it out in the Republican debates — and on the hardcover nonfiction best-seller list.,"No Joy: The Republican debates aren’t the only place Donald Trump and Ben Carson are duking it out these days. They’re also competing on the hardcover nonfiction list, where Carson’s book “A More Perfect Union” (written with his wife, Candy Carson) is No. 4 after five weeks and Trump’s book “Crippled America” makes its debut at No. 5. Both men have been here before, of course, Carson with two previous best sellers and Trump with eight (most notably “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” written with Tony Schwartz, which spent 48 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list in 1987 and 1988). So what do their books reveal about the candidates? Nothing we didn’t know already from watching them campaign. Carson is genial and bland in advancing his model of Christian conservatism; in his latest book, a paean to the Constitution, each chapter opens with a Bible verse. And Trump is blustery and vain and entertaining. Here he is discussing his book’s cover, which shows him with a stern Sam the Eagle frown: “Some readers may be wondering why the picture we used on the cover of this book is so angry and so mean looking. I had some beautiful pictures taken in which I had a big smile on my face. I looked happy, I looked content, I looked like a very nice person, which in theory I am. My family loved those pictures and wanted me to use one of them. The photographer did a great job. But I decided it wasn’t appropriate. In this book we’re talking about Crippled America — that’s a tough title. Unfortunately, there’s very little that’s nice about it. . . . So I wanted a picture where I wasn’t happy, a picture that reflected the anger and unhappiness that I feel, rather than joy. There’s nothing to be joyful about. Because we are not in a joyous situation right now.”"
"‘We That Are Left,’ by Clare Clark",2015-11-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In the wake of World War I, survivors explore new ways to connect to lost loved ones.","There’s an exchange halfway through Clare Clark’s fine new novel that gets to the heart of the book’s concerns. The speakers are Oscar Greenwood, studying physics at Cambridge just when Einstein’s theory of relativity is gaining widespread attention, and Phyllis Melville, a World War I nurse who, post-armistice, is intent on becoming an archaeologist. “Just because we can’t picture something,” Oscar tells her, “doesn’t mean it isn’t true.” “I thought scientists weren’t allowed to say things like that,” she observes.

But listening, according to the feminist icon Gloria Steinem, is even more important.

And keep asking questions."
Rebecca Hunt’s ‘Everland’,2015-11-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A novel interweaves two Antarctic expeditions, a century apart.","It is 1913, and a British expedition to Antarctica runs into disaster. Three members of the crew — Napps, a natural if overbearing leader; Millet-Bass, a physically imposing veteran of sea and ice; and Dinners, a young man inexperienced in everything to do with exploration life and the Antarctic — set out in a dinghy from the mother ship, Kismet, to explore the island they have named Everland in homage to their patron, Joseph Evelyn. But a storm arises as the men depart and when eventually they wash ashore their task is no longer exploration but survival. Echoes of Captain Scott’s disastrous Antarctic expedition ring through the story of the fictitious Kismet, but are never overplayed, and the Kismet’s venture slips plausibly among the other known sagas of this so-called Heroic Age of exploration."

Kamikaze-style, suicidal defense will forever be associated with Japan. But it was Nazi Germany that actually immolated itself. While Hitler lived, there could be no negotiation. There would be no surrender, no repeat of the November 1918 armistice. The result was the devastation not only of much of Central Europe, but also of Germany itself. In the course of the war, 5.3 million men would die fighting in Wehrmacht uniform. Close to a million German civilians were killed in air raids and the ethnic cleansing that followed the war. Germany’s casualties far exceeded those of all of Western Europe put together. And the violence escalated as the war went on. The largest number died in the last desperate months, the worst being January 1945, when the Wehrmacht lost 450,000 — more in a matter of weeks than America would suffer in all of its wars of the 20th century."
Robert Reich’s ‘Saving Capitalism’,2015-11-13,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Capitalism (Theory and Philosophy)']","Reich argues that capitalism should create broad prosperity, not just vast gains for the wealthy.","To understand “Saving Capitalism,” Robert Reich’s sweeping treatise on inequality in America, you must accept a central premise: The free market is fundamentally a human construct and so to debate the appropriateness of government in shaping it is beside the point. Someone is always writing the rules of the market. Reich’s concern is that over the last three decades, the lead authors have been Wall Street, big corporations and the wealthy elite. His fear is that “we are lurching toward a capitalism so top-heavy it cannot be sustained.”"

Elizabeth Tallent’s ‘Mendocino Fire’,2015-11-13,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Tallent’s stories show how easily love can alter.,"“How could narrators so prodigal in their empathy originate in the brain of that withholder?” So muses the unnamed woman who speaks to us in Elizabeth Tallent’s story “Narrator,” which comes near the end of her enchanting new collection, “Mendocino Fire.” That “withholder” is a famous writer, sprawled on the steps of the stairwell at a “welcome get-­together” for students in the creative writing program at Berkeley, and she has just watched him be flamboyantly rude to two young female admirers. Having thought highly of his novels, the new student has imagined the great man must have a “radiance” and “generosity of spirit” that are clearly not on offer. She feels betrayed."

Julie d’Aubigny, a.k.a. Mademoiselle de Maupin, a.k.a. La Travesti, grew up in Versailles on the periphery of Louis XIV’s court, where her father served as secretary to the Sun King’s master of horse. Papa d’Aubigny taught the court pages — and his daughter, who from childhood on dressed “as a chevalier who happened to be born female” — to fence; and Julie became an expert swordsman and equestrian, a seductress of both women and men, a tavern brawler and itinerant singer, and improbably — but what is not improbable in this narrative? — an operatic superstar at the Académie Royale de Musique in Paris. She died in a convent in 1707 at the age of 33."

From where I stood, neither demographic projections nor existing patterns of assimilation nor the continent’s ideological currents seemed to support a vision of a Europe where “Shariah has as much clout as liberalism” by, say, 2045. Instead, I argued that the European future would probably be like the present, only more so:"

Sarah Vowell’s ‘Lafayette in the Somewhat United States’,2015-11-17,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Lafayette was hailed as a hero on his 1820s American tour.,"The full name was Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert du Motier, which was quite a mouthful for Yankee sensibilities, but the Marquis de Lafayette became one of the first American celebrities anyway. (The new nation had a sweet tooth for the flattery of Frenchmen. That’s also how Tocqueville managed to freeload his way across the Northwest Territories.) Lafayette came over the Atlantic to fight in the American Revolution when he was 19. He went home to France and tried to be a centrist politician during that country’s upheaval. This was rather like aspiring to be a pot roast in a den of wolverines. But he survived the Revolution and the Terror, turned down a job in Napoleon’s government, and in 1824, he returned to the United States at the invitation of James Monroe. He visited all 24 of the states at the time. The tour took more than a year, and Lafayette was cheered at every stop. He survived the sinking of his steamboat in the Ohio River, and lived to help lay the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown, Mass. He also survived an oration by Daniel Webster on that same occasion."

They’re fundamentally fraught spaces, where we undress and obey the dictates of our bodies and therefore feel vulnerable.

Although those drugs prevent H.I.V. infection and transmission, they do not prevent the spread of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papilloma virus, herpes or trichomoniasis. "

Revisiting the Mayflower Story,2015-11-18,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A picture book presents a new perspective on the adventure-filled tale behind the first Thanksgiving.,"The story behind the first Thanksgiving — the full story, which starts with a band of harassed outsiders living in exile, then cramming aboard an iffy ship and arriving bedraggled and sick on a different continent, where half of them promptly died and the other half had little idea how to stay alive in the frigid wilderness — has the makings of a great adventure tale. Yet it’s rarely treated that way, perhaps because it’s so bound up in our national mythology. It tends to sag under the weight of its own symbolism, whether the narrative it’s used to uphold emphasizes the upbeat-spiritual or the oppressive-genocidal strain of United States history."

"In L.A., Female Video Artists Reign",2015-11-19,article,News,,"['Art', 'Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming']",Solo exhibitions in the city by three women explore the medium in very different ways.,"Video-based art is having a moment among women in Los Angeles. Three female artists with solo exhibitions on view there this fall aim to shift perceptions of the medium’s potential, using it to capture everything from Op Art-like abstractions to provocative depictions of animal life. Diana Thater, whose career-spanning show opens next week at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, posits that the appeal of video for women might come from the medium’s relative newness — there are no old masters glowering from the textbook pages. “Women could enter into it without this art-historical legacy,” Thater says. “There is no male-dominated history, so there’s more freedom.”"

His repeating images of humble domestic objects — bottles, long-necked vases and little cookie tins set against expanses of empty wall and tabletop — can blend together and appear steeped in nostalgia.

Vilhelm Hammershoi’s Paintings at Scandinavia House,2015-11-19,article,Review,,['Art'],"This exhibition includes 24 works from the collection of the National Gallery of Denmark, selected by its chief curator, Kasper Monrad.","One of Denmark’s most celebrated artists, Vilhelm Hammershoi (1864-1916), was known in his day as “the painter of tranquil rooms.” He worked during an era of great changes in Western art: Around the turn of the 20th century, traditional realism no longer seemed an adequate way to express the myriad revolutionary ideas percolating all over Europe. As viewers may observe in “Painting Tranquility: Masterworks by Vilhelm Hammershoi From SMK – The National Gallery of Denmark,” a beautiful small exhibition at Scandinavia House, his paintings convey a distinctively modern psychological complexity. But unlike another famous Scandinavian, the Expressionist Edvard Munch, Hammershoi practiced a kind of representational painting dating back to Rembrandt and Vermeer. With their severely muted colors, Hammershoi’s portraits and pictures of women in nearly empty rooms may call to mind the suavely subdued paintings of James McNeill Whistler. Although influenced by him, Hammershoi never pushed as far toward abstract abbreviation as Whistler."

Inside the List,2015-11-20,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Mitch Albom’s latest heartwarming and slightly gooey best seller is about a supernaturally gifted guitarist.,"Beautiful Music: Almost six years ago, when Inside the List asked a handful of authors to declare their literary New Year’s resolutions, Mitch Albom pledged “to read more books about hope and less about angst.” It was no surprise, frankly. Can anybody picture Albom — whose heartwarming and slightly gooey best sellers include “Tuesdays With Morrie” and “The Five People You Meet in Heaven” — settling in for the night with, say, a dyspeptic Thomas Bernhard novel? Now Albom’s back with “The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto,” about a supernaturally gifted guitarist who influences musicians as diverse as Hank Williams and Wynton Marsalis and Kiss; it’s new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. A musician himself, Albom plays keyboards with the Rock Bottom Remainders, where his bandmates include Amy Tan on vocals and Stephen King on rhythm guitar, among assorted other best-selling authors. (“We mostly listen to Dave Barry telling booger jokes,” Albom has said.) “The theme I was trying to build on for this book was that everybody joins a band in life,” he told The Philadelphia Daily News this month. “Everyone joins a band. We may not think we do, but we do. Somebody plays the lead. Somebody is the rhythm. Somebody holds down the beat. Somebody gets to solo and go all over the place, while the other person gets stuck playing the chords. That’s pretty much how it is in a family. That’s how it is in the Army. That’s how it is in a workplace. Everybody has a role that they play.”"

"‘Thirteen Ways of Looking,’ by Colum McCann",2015-11-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The Wallace Stevens poem from which it takes its title helps structure the novella anchoring Colum McCann’s book of short fiction.,"Colum McCann has an old-school belief in the capabilities of literature. Even as au courant novelists all around him grow skeptical of the artifices of character and plot, and embrace the self as the fiction writer’s only truly accessible subject, McCann’s work continues to assert that nothing human is alien to him, that the empathetic imagination can and should go where it pleases. He has written eight previous books in which he fearlessly simulates identities dauntingly remote from his own — including the identities of real-life figures both dead and living — and in which plot performs a function that might fairly be described as redemptive. From the perspective of academic fashion it is a hoary, virtually benighted approach to narrative art; yet to judge by the enormous success of his work, most notably the panoramic novels “Let the Great World Spin” and “TransAtlantic,” its appeal to readers somehow endures."

Simon Winchester’s ‘Pacific’,2015-11-20,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Audiobooks']","A survey of the Pacific includes chapters on coral reefs, thermonuclear bombs and cyclones.","Over the decades, the British-born Simon Winchester has emerged as one of those increasingly rare geographic generalists, migrating from region to region, sharing with his readers an almost tactile sense of the earth, its history and its peoples. His narratives exist within that depressingly vast space between the hairsplitting nuances and abstractions of academia and the vulgar simplicities of cable news pundits. A highbrow out to educate middlebrows, Winchester writes books like someone telling a good yarn around the fireplace, whether about volcanoes, Indian slums or the 19th-century American West. He is an outdoorsman who knows about such things as geology and ocean sailing, which invigorates his prose in the same way as that of another journalistic travel writer, William Langewiesche, who flies planes and also sails. And he certainly has the knack for comparison. When Winchester writes that Hawaii, deep down, “in its perceived cultural essence,” still evokes what “was felt by Gauguin during his time in the Marquesas,” it is reminiscent of the British travel writer Jan Morris describing in 1960 how the smells and landscape of the Lido in Venice ignite thoughts of Carthage and Marrakesh."

One imagines that this sensorial attachment to Paris was never stronger than in recent days, after the city suffered terrorist attacks that killed more than 120 people. At Parigot, an authentically cozy French bistro on Grand Street in SoHo, a trio of Parisians mourned, talked, worried, remembered and toasted one another, both missing their city and at the same time perhaps feeling glad that they were far away."

The very act of transferring the words of another into the brain activates the inner voice, the voice that we “hear” when we read to ourselves. All reading is therefore a vocal performance, generally just for an audience of one. Consider how much the language of reading and writing supports this notion: We talk about an author’s voice and tone and rhythm. We ask, “What is the author trying to say?”"

Vidal was a tireless self-mythologizer, and as his title suggests, that book is a layering of rememberings, re-rememberings and mis-rememberings. In his new, much sounder biography, “Empire of Self,” Jay Parini suggests that even the account of Vidal’s idyllic romance with his high school friend Jimmie Trimble, one of the touchstones of “Palimpsest” — the story of a love so perfect and unearthly that it could never be duplicated — was most likely a fabrication."

Returning to Italy, he wrote his memoir of Auschwitz, “If This Is a Man” (1947), and worked 30 years for a paint factory while writing stories, poems, memoirs, essays, a novel and “The Periodic Table” (1975), his idiosyncratic autobiography in which each chapter was named for a chemical element and some chapters were short stories."

How to Navigate By the Stars,2015-11-25,article,News,,"['Navigation', 'Stars and Galaxies']",Find your north. Go out between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.,"‘‘Use the stars to find the four cardinal directions,’’ says Chadd Onohi Paishon, a master navigator with the Polynesian Voyaging Society who steers double-hulled canoes from Hawaii to Tahiti and beyond without any instruments or charts. Paishon doesn’t know how to use a GPS device or a magnetic compass, but he can orient himself on land or sea with a glance at the heavens. Determine north by finding the North Star, which does not set when you’re north of the Equator. As seafarers have done for millenniums, you can determine about how many miles north of the Equator you are by measuring the distance between the North Star and the horizon. To do this, stretch out your arm. For most, one fist equals approximately 10 degrees; latitudinal degrees each represent about 69 miles. The farther north you go, the higher the star looks in the sky. South of the Equator, you won’t see the North Star but must rely on a constellation called the Southern Cross to help you find south."

Such were the prerogatives and exigencies of the artist’s existence, until M.F.A. programs arrived to impose discipline and provide livelihoods. Whether the professionalization of creative writing has been good for American literature has set off a lot of elegantly worded soul-searching and well-mannered debate recently, much of it in response to Mark McGurl’s seminal study, “The Program Era.” What Eric ­Bennett’s “Workshops of Empire” contributes is an understanding of how Cold War politics helped to create the aesthetic standards that continue to rule over writing workshops today.

Mary Gaitskill’s ‘The Mare’,2015-11-25,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"An emotionally electric triangle of a woman, a girl and a horse is mutually transformative.","Desire and damage have long intertwined, an inseparable couple, in the work of Mary Gaitskill. With her first collection of stories in 1988, “Bad Behavior,” Gaitskill staked out her territory: love, or something, among the ruins — the ruins of self, the ruins of hope, the ruins created by cruelty, both literal and psychological. In Gaitskill’s work, people hurt one another for fun, for spite, inadvertently, because they can, and (as she titled a later collection) because they wanted to. In one of Gaitskill’s most famous stories, “Secretary,” which later became a film of the same name, an alienated young woman is sexually used by her boss, but finds the encounter has an array of effects. She is simultaneously dissociated, disgusted, turned on, depressed, oddly loyal to the boss and somehow liberated. It is not right, and it also awakens something vital in her. Gaitskill’s story doesn’t prioritize one emotion over any others or draw any moral conclusions. As she wrote in a 1994 Harper’s essay, “On Not Being a Victim,” “pain can be an experience that defies codification.” In that story, as in much of Gaitskill’s work, the heroine’s ability to remain aware of all uncodifiable experience, to turn it over and examine it, is how she stays alive."

1940: Students Clash in Zagreb,2015-11-27,article,News,,['World War II (1939-45)'],From the International Herald Tribune archives: Radical Croatian students fight supporters of Yugoslav national unity in 1940.,"BELGRADE, Yugoslavia — An incident that carries with it a heavy charge of political dynamite occurred in the Croatian university town of Zagreb today [Nov. 27] when extreme Croatian Nationalist students clashed with a group of ‘‘moderate’’ students supporting Dr. Vladko Matchek’s policy of co-operation with the Serbs. The fight, in which a number of students were seriously wounded, occurred on the occasion of a meeting held within the university by the extremist group, which favors independence for Croatia. The university was closed and guarded by the police so as to avoid a possible disturbance, but the ‘‘moderate’’ students — those favoring Yugoslav national unity — forced their way in through the cellar and tried to break up the meeting. The clash which ensued ended only when the police quickly restored order and made a number of arrests. The incident assumed special importance in view of Yugoslavia’s uncertain diplomatic relations with a number of her neighbors. The position of this country, nearly surrounded by potential foes, resembles that of Czecho-Slovakia in 1939. In the internal situation, too, there is a parallel. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 28, 1940"

Now he’s back, right on cue, with “The Mistletoe Inn,” new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 9. What draws Evans so repeatedly to Christmas? Readers prone to psychoanalyzing might find a clue on his website, where Evans describes the “tsunami of misfortune” that hit his family in 1970, the year he turned 8. “My father lost his job and couldn’t find work, and my mother began to exhibit the first signs of severe depression. My Tourette’s syndrome manifested that year and I was ticking like crazy. In addition, I wet the bed every night, made worse since I shared the bed with my brother,” he writes. “During this dark time I had a soul-crushing fourth-grade teacher named Mrs. Covey. I’ll never forget two weeks before Christmas when she ridiculed those of us who still believed in Santa with the words: ‘Your parents lied to you. There is no Santa.’ Crushed, I went home and asked my mother if she had lied. My mother frowned. She said, ‘Santa is the spirit of giving.’"
