(Sundance) ORLANDO (1993) A beautiful young nobleman (Tilda Swinton, above) adored by an aging Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp) falls asleep one night in the 17th century and wakes up five days later as a woman. “Same person, no difference at all,” she says, unflustered. “Just a different sex.” She continues to learn about life through the centuries up until the present, pondering the differences between men and women — as well as their similarities — in this adaptation by Sally Potter of Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel. Charlotte Valandrey plays Sasha, a wanton Muscovite princess with whom the male Orlando falls in love. Billy Zane is the American with whom Orlando’s female version has a more enduring if less sexually demanding relationship. “This ravishing and witty spectacle invades the mind through eyes that are dazzled without ever being anesthetized,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “ ‘Orlando’ could well become a classic of a very special kind, not mainstream perhaps, but a model for independent filmmakers who follow their own irrational muses, sometimes to unmourned obscurity, occasionally to glory.” More than anything else, he added: “ ‘Orlando’ is Ms. Swinton’s triumph. With the firmest but lightest of touches, she has spun gossamer.”"

"‘Reagan: The Life,’ by H. W. Brands",2015-06-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A new biography tries to understand our elusive 40th president.,"For a man who lived most of his life on camera, Ronald Reagan eludes focus. There was, and remains, a gauziness to the picture; Reagan retained, throughout his political career, the remoteness of a screen idol, though he never achieved that status as a movie actor. He was ubiquitous for decades and, as president, left a lasting imprint on America’s political culture. Yet he was all the same an unknowable man — even to those nearest him. In White House meetings, he was mostly silent, often leaving his aides to guess at (and feud over) his views. In his personal relationships, he was unfailingly warm but rarely intimate. “He doesn’t let anybody get too close,” one observer said. “There’s a wall around him.” That the observer was his wife, Nancy, should give pause to any politician or pundit who claims to know what Reagan would do if he were here today. (It should, but it won’t.)"

Such a house sits at the heart of Mat Johnson’s ribald, incisive novel “Loving Day.” Bequeathed to the narrator, Warren Duffy, by his deceased father, it’s a roofless, ramshackle mansion in a black neighborhood in Philadelphia: “I look at the buckling floors. I look at the cracks in all the walls, the evidence of a foundation crumbling beneath us. I smell the char of the fire, the sweet reek of mold, the insult of mouse urine. I see a million things that have to be fixed, restored, corrected, each one impossible and each task mandatory for me to escape again.” "

"‘The Making of Zombie Wars,’ by Aleksandar Hemon",2015-06-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Aleksandar Hemon’s comic novel about alienation and the undead.,"The Summer of Love rolled into town and left behind an S.T.D. otherwise known as 1968. The Vietnam War ratcheted up the body count. Racial strife led to nationwide riots. The murders of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy must have made the end times seem at bloody hand. Cue Nixon and that silent majority. Forty-seven years later we still live in the era’s apocalyptic shadow, those events a zombie horde in ever-present pursuit — race issues, ill-considered wars, the Russians — that infects us with the undead past. Oh, and you can also blame 1968 for that unfortunate metaphor, because in October of that year George A. Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead” introduced us to a new kind of zombie: slow yet relentless, brainless yet hungry, endlessly symbolic yet always supercool. These flesh eaters have fed well on our culture, evolving from B-movie ghouls to bankable, if thankless, stars of film and screen, book and video game, to the point where they should probably unionize. We are living in peak zombie. Now, into this fray tiptoes Aleksandar Hemon with his latest novel, “The Making of Zombie Wars.”"

In April, Sarvshreshth Gupta, a 24-year-old first-year analyst at Goldman Sachs, was found dead in San Francisco after telling his father about suffering from intense stress. The official cause of death has not yet been determined in either case, but a recent string of deaths among young Wall Street workers have prompted financial firms to re-evaluate their work policies’ impact on staff members,  Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.

What’s On TV Wednesday,2015-06-03,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"5:15 P.M. (IFC) AMERICAN HISTORY X (1998) In an Oscar-nominated role, Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a white supremacist who goes to prison for a gruesome killing. He renounces racism there, but his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), a high school student, remains steadfast in the attitudes he learned from Derek. After Danny writes a book report on “Mein Kampf,” his principal, Dr. Robert Sweeney (Avery Brooks, above left, with Mr. Norton), creates a remedial course for him called American History X. Dr. Sweeney visits Derek in prison and they agree to try to persuade Danny to give up his bigotry. “ ‘American History X’ has enough fiery acting and provocative bombast to make its impact felt,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times about this film directed by Tony Kaye. “For one thing, its willingness to take on ugly political realities gives it a substantial raison d’être. For another, it has been directed with a mixture of handsome photo-realism and visceral punch.” "

Last week, the Houston Ballet gave the premiere of Mr. Morris’s “The Letter V” — choreographed to Haydn’s Symphony No. 88 in G (1787). (Some Haydn symphonies were once known by letters of the alphabet; V was assigned to this one — hence this ballet’s title.)"

A Chandelier That Stands the Tests of Time,2015-06-04,article,News,,"['ARCHITECTURE', 'Lighting', 'Watches and Clocks']",The architect and glassblower Alison Berger’s latest lighting fixture is inspired by the anatomy of a pocket watch.,"“I like instruments that try to quantify the ephemeral; a barometer traces air pressure, or an astrolabe charts the stars, and this measures the passing of time,” says the artist Alison Berger, gesturing to a printout from the book “Pocket Watches: From the Pendant Watch to the Tourbillon.” The anatomy of the once-everyday trinket, and her training as an architect and as a glassblower, informed her latest creation, the Clock Chandelier. “One gear moves slowly and the other moves quickly — large and small, fast and slow,” she says, a rhythm articulated in the spacing of the chandelier’s lightbulbs and candles suspended from three interlocking bronze and steel rings. Berger, who has made so-called heirlooms for the upcoming generation (think cereal bowls, in lieu of egg cups) for Hermès and has constructed a new façade for a Comme des Garçons store, considered each detail: The candlelit lanterns can be unhooked for cleaning and the rings fit together using pins, as they would in a timepiece. “The chandelier looks open and endless from one view, but on the other side it is more compressed,” Berger says — a metaphor, she explains, for the feeling of, “Oh my god, it’s already 5 o’clock.” "

Haydn (1732-1809) isn’t just a central composer of that period; he also often exemplifies the same qualities as Mr. Morris: high spirits, terrific humor, a strong inclination to the pastoral and a keen instinct for structural experimentation. Last week, the Houston Ballet gave the premiere of Mr. Morris’s “The Letter V” — choreographed to Haydn’s Symphony No. 88 in G (1787). (Some Haydn symphonies were once known by letters of the alphabet; V was assigned to this one — hence this ballet’s title.) "

If Dish does acquire T-Mobile, one person briefed on the negotiations said that instead of trying to bundle a Dish satellite television subscription with a T-Mobile wireless package, the new company would focus on creating a network that can stream mobile video to smartphones and tablets.

"‘The Given World,’ by Marian Palaia",2015-06-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Lives in the U.S. are turned upside down by the Vietnam War in this debut novel.,"The story of Riley, the heroine of “The Given World” — Marian Palaia’s ardent, ambitious debut novel — might sound familiar at first. It has all the elements of a particular kind of post-60s American ­coming-of-age story: Farm kid leaves home for the big city (in Riley’s case, rural Montana is abandoned for San Francisco) and dives headlong into adulthood, with all of its requisite heartbreak. Drugs are ingested, Janis Joplin is played on a jukebox, and many drives are taken through the countryside on motorcycles or a beat-up Mustang. But “The Given World” contains what feels like 12 times the usual dose of tragedy within its pages, because Riley and her generation come of age poisoned by the Vietnam War.

What could possibly have attracted them to a sect of fundamentalist thugs who use religion to justify violence and misogyny? Might the rebellious, hormonal storm of their age be partly to blame? Robyn Cadwallader, probably didn’t have ISIS in mind when she sat down to write “The Anchoress,” her affecting novel about a teenage girl walled up in a village in 1255 England, but the parallels are there if one chooses to consider them.

"‘Coup de Foudre,’ by Ken Kalfus",2015-06-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This novella is a thinly — or not so thinly — veiled account of the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair.,"You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style, as Nabokov’s Humbert Humbert admitted, and in his spectacular novella “Coup de Foudre,” Ken Kalfus has created an equally articulate monster. First appearing in Harper’s and collected now with his latest short stories, “Coup de Foudre” is a thinly — or possibly barely — veiled account of the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair, in which Strauss-Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a housekeeper at a New York City hotel. The criminal charges, which led to the disclosure of a hidden world of sex parties and erotic compulsion, came to nothing. But Strauss-Kahn eventually paid a hefty fine after a civil action, and his reputation was ruined, perhaps because of the question that was impossible to ignore: “What made him do it?” What would cause the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, wealthy and successful beyond measure, to risk everything in such a fashion?

"Robert Goddard’s ‘The Ways of the World,’ and More",2015-06-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The dashing protagonist of Goddard’s historical espionage thriller is a refreshing throwback to an earlier romantic tradition of heroes.,"In the company of fictional detectives who emerged from their wartime experiences shellshocked and haunted, former Lt. James (Max) Maxted, the dashing protagonist of Robert Goddard’s historical espionage thriller THE WAYS OF THE WORLD (Mysterious Press, $25), is a refreshing throwback to an earlier romantic tradition of heroes. Max was an ace fighter pilot with the Royal Flying Corps in World War I, and having had what the British call “a good war,” he’s not content to settle down on his family’s ancestral estate now that it’s over. But Max’s dreams of starting a flying school are dashed when his diplomat father, Sir Henry Maxted, falls to his death while in Paris as a member of the British delegation laboring over the Treaty of Versailles."
Inside the List,2015-06-05,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Chuck Palahniuk, whose “Make Something Up” is No. 8 on the hardcover fiction list, is also promoting his first graphic novel, a sequel to his 1996 novel “Fight Club.”","Save the Ducklings: Chuck Palahniuk — who remains best known for the 1996 novel “Fight Club,” despite a string of subsequent hits — has another hardcover best seller with his first story collection, “Make Something Up,” new at No. 8. There’s no mistaking Palahniuk’s sense of plotting. Here’s how Robert Brink of the website The Hundreds sums up the collection: “So this one kid, he’s pledging for a frat and drops acid, the Hello Kitty kind, right before he’s about to be a contestant on ‘The Price Is Right.’ And this other guy, he slaps his prostate-cancer-­ridden, morphine-­pickled father square in the face with a pie as he’s dying in his hospital bed. And then there’s these high school kids who begin to lobotomize themselves with cardiac defibrillators because they discovered the key to true happiness.” Yep, that’s Palahniuk. Even casual fans, though, may be interested to know that “Make Something Up” is not the only new book Palahniuk is promoting — he’s also written his first graphic novel, and it’s a sequel bearing the straightforward title “Fight Club 2.” In an interview with The Wrap, he explained he needed some distance before he felt ready to revisit this story. “If I followed it up too soon,” he said, “my whole career would be writing progressively less interesting sequels to ‘Fight Club.’ ” He chose the comics format, he said, because “if it was written as a novel or a film, it’d be compared to previous versions. . . . Certain things work in comics because there’s a slight aspect of unreality.” Given his reputation for disturbing readers, Palahniuk was asked, what makes him personally squeamish? “I saw a headline about animal abuse recently,” he replied. “ ‘Man Runs Over Ducklings With Lawnmower.’ That kind of stuff.”"

He especially loved puns that could be found hiding in one word, like wonderland: a place full of wonders and a place where you wonder what is happening to you. These meanings are not only different, they can be read as opposites, as Robert ­Douglas-Fairhurst reminds us, quoting a Victorian evocation of a person “who, being in a chronic state of wonder, is surprised at nothing.” Sentimental memories of the Alice books often stress the first, dazzled meaning, but a fresh reading of Carroll is likely to leave us much closer to the second, which Douglas-Fairhurst neatly formulates as “being puzzled at what we do not know.” This is how the flowers talk in “Through the Looking-Glass”: “I wonder how you do it,” a rose says to ­Alice, referring to her odd human ability to move about. “You’re always wondering,” an irritated tiger-lily says."

As performing magicians, they seek vengeance on each other through obsessive one-upmanship. Rebecca Hall and Michael Caine play supporting roles as Angier’s wife and his manager. “ ‘The Prestige,’ directed by Christopher Nolan from a script he wrote with his brother Jonathan, is an intricate and elaborate machine designed for the simple purpose of diversion,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Set in a stylized late-Victorian world of dueling music-hall magicians and diabolically clever inventors, it has a satisfyingly puzzlelike structure, zipping around in time and scattering clues throughout its busy scenes and frames. Like ‘Memento,’ also directed by Christopher Nolan and based on a story by his brother, ‘The Prestige’ is a triumph of gimmickry, a movie generous enough with its showmanship and sleight of hand to quiet the temptation to grumble about its lack of substance.”"

Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva, said that roughly 600 refugees a day were arriving in the Greek islands, and that half of them were coming ashore in Lesbos, a picturesque tourist destination ill equipped to handle the flow. The Lesbos arrivals have grown steadily by the month, from 737 in January to more than 7,200 in May. Mr. Edwards said the arrivals, crammed into rubber dinghies and wooden boats, were “straining the island’s capacity, services and resources.” They are part of a broader exodus of people from the Middle East and Africa fleeing war and deprivations in their home countries for risky and sometimes deadly Mediterranean trips to Europe, which has created a crisis for the European Union. The refugee agency said there had been 103,000 refugee and migrant arrivals in Europe via the Mediterranean so far in 2015. "

A Guide to Reading Rituals,2015-06-10,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A new picture book is a “how to"" manual for little people who have just gotten the hang of reading.","Agreed: We need to do more than just help children learn to read —we need to help them learn to love reading and make reading a habit, even a craving. But in many schools — unintentionally, tragically — a kind of creeping police state emerges around reading. It’s not enough for some teachers to tell children to read for, say, 20 minutes or half an hour each night. Many children must report back with a “reading log” in which they record not just the titles and authors of the books they’ve read, but also the number of minutes spent reading and pages read. Never mind that this exercise turns something private and immeasurable into a piece of data. Isn’t it teaching, above all, the art of the fudge?"

A Graceful Midcentury Armchair by Gio Ponti,2015-06-10,article,News,,['Chairs'],The D.154.2 chair is a manifestation of the Italian master’s twin ideals of harmony and joy.,"While he may be best known for the harmonica-like Pirelli Tower and the perfectly simple Superleggera chair, the midcentury design giant Gio Ponti was also a master of more organic and sensuous forms. His favorite commission was Villa Planchart, situated above Caracas, a building “made for the life of its inhabitants,” which he filled with silks, jades and orchids. The building, he wrote, “must have the grace and lightness of a resting butterfly.” The same could be said of the armchair he made for the villa in 1954, which hovers on slender legs, its arms swooping like wings. (An all-white version floated in the entrance; one with a plush green cushion perched in the living room.) Now in production by the Italian design house Molteni & C, the D.154.2 chair is an immediate and understated classic — a manifestation of Ponti’s twin ideals of harmony and joy."

From the early 1920s to his capture in 1938, Lampião and his gang controlled much of the Sertão, a huge and dusty swath of land in the northeast of the country, “almost the size of Spain.” More than once, they were cornered but managed to escape. For a long time, Lampião seemed invincible and his life, as Shorr puts it, “was a tango, full of beauty and danger, mixed.”"

Folkways and Family in America,2015-06-12,article,News,,"['ABORTION', 'Immigration and Emigration', 'Marriages', 'Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints)', 'Race and Ethnicity']",Getting beyond the “red family” versus “blue family” debate.,"Occasionally in the debates about family structure in America, I’ve had reason to point out the limits of the popular “red family, blue family” dichotomy, which portrays a post-sexual revolution America divided between a late-marrying, lower-divorce-rate model of family formation in liberal regions and an earlier-marrying, frequently-divorcing model in more conservative and religious states. This portrayal, particularly associated with the sociologists Naomi Cahn and June Carbone, definitely captures one distinctive reality of American life — the fact that stable two-parent homes are more common among secular liberal Bobos in the BosWash corridor and elsewhere than they are in, say, certain regions in the Bible Belt. But it’s also important to recognize the exceptions to this pattern, from “red” social models (in the High Plains and Mormon Utah, in particular) that combine high marriage rates and birthrates and relative family stability to “blue” social models (inner city, Rust Belt, Southwestern) that are as unstable as anything Alabaman and Mississippian. (And that’s without getting into the issue of abortion as a necessary prop for “blue” stability.)"

Inside the List,2015-06-12,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Judy Blume, whose adult novel “In the Unlikely Event” is No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list, had two million books in print in 1976, well before The Times had a children’s best-seller list.","Blume’s Day: In the summer of 1976, the Book Review took note of a “new frankness in children’s literature,” and cited as ­Exhibit A the novels of Judy Blume: “She is a kind of heroine to the kids who read and reread her books, and a kind of Little League Grace Metalious to the mothers.” Metalious, you may remember, was the author of “Peyton Place” — that decidedly Major League novel of suburban smut — and being seen as a junior version didn’t hurt Blume’s popularity any. Starting with “Wifey” in 1978 and continuing right up to “In the Unlikely Event” (new at No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list), all four of her adult novels have been best sellers. That’s more than you can say for her most celebrated children’s books, including “Blubber” and “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,” although it’s not their fault: The Times didn’t introduce a children’s best-seller list until 2000. Had one existed in 1976, Blume would surely have been on it. She had some two million books in print that year, according to the Times article, which further observed that “Blume’s appeal lies in her ability to speak directly to her readers’ experience. Her characters are usually suburban kids, and not always nice ones.” Blume recently told NPR’s “Weekend Edition” that when she was an adolescent herself, she preferred grown-up literature. “Starting at 12, really, and onward, I was reading adult books,” she said. “Everything that I was curious about, about the adult world, I learned from reading those books. Or I got from them, you know, some idea of what it was like to be grown-up. Which is what I was very, very curious about.”"
"Popcast: Tenement, Punk and the DIY Scene",2015-06-12,article,News,,['Music'],"Ben Ratliff, Maria Sherman and Liz Pelly discuss the band’s new album.","“Predatory Headlights” is the new album by Tenement, the punk trio from Appleton, Wis. It’s an accomplishment. It’s a double album, with 25 songs, and it took more than three years to make. It gives you an enlarged sense of what the primary songwriter, Amos Pitsch, is most trained at: tightly written riff songs with an almost classical pop sense, descended from pop-punk while transcending its clichés. But it also includes experimental compositions and arrangements involving strings and field recordings and an out-of-tune piano. “Predatory Headlights” is strong and strange and detailed and cohesive; if people are still listening to records from 2015 in 20 years, this might be one of them. Tenement started in 2006 and has spent a lot of its life on the DIY circuit, gigging in living rooms and basements. For quite a while, if you wanted a Tenement record, you had to buy one at a gig. It appears on bills and has recorded split EPs with far more noisy, simple straight-ahead hardcore bands, but it plays music that sounds as if it could have been almost popular at some point in the recent past. Where does Tenement fit into the current punk-hardcore-DIY scene? "

Nelsan Ellis is Bobby Byrd, Brown’s longtime best friend, who sticks around as the wives and girlfriends come and go. “Brown’s music and show business ascendance are the heart and soul of a movie that takes his art very seriously,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “None other than Mick Jagger, who has made no secret of his indebtedness to Brown’s stage moves, is the music producer of this film, which puts music front and center, where it belongs. Brown’s real voice, which never sounds dubbed, is used in remixes of his original recordings.” And while the film “largely skirts the issue of race” along with Brown’s alienation of black audiences because of his support of Richard M. Nixon, “in the end, he stood above it all,” Mr. Holden added. “Having won the game, he dwelt in his own realm, where he ruled once and for always as the Godfather of Soul.”"

"‘The Prime of Life,’ by Steven Mintz",2015-06-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Steven Mintz’s new book gives a full historical timeline of the defining features of adulthood.,"The notion that adulthood, despite its perks, is little more than a booby prize for surviving the scrapes and trials of youth has more or less become a cultural given in the modern age. From the 1950s narrative of soul-crushed men in gray flannel suits to the existential torment of hippies-turned-yuppies in the 1980s to the ­tyrannical scheduling demands of today’s Lean In movement, grown-up life in America is generally framed as a sort of bland entree following the assortment of colorful appetizers that make up childhood and young adulthood.

This reigning paradigm, which dictates that every act of nurturing be judged on the basis of whether it will usher a child toward a life of accomplishment or failure, embodies the fundamental insecurity of global capitalist culture, with its unbending fixation on prosperity and the future. It’s no surprise that parenting incites such heated debates, considering how paradoxical these principles can be when they’re applied to children. When each nurturing act is administered with the distant future in mind, what becomes of the present? A child who soaks in the ambient anxiety that surrounds each trivial choice or activity is an anxious child, formed in the hand-wringing, future-focused image of her anxious parents."

They don’t need to. With so much first-rate music written for the violin, the motivation to adapt and transcribe works written for other instruments is low. So why did Rachel Podger, one of the leading performers on the Baroque violin, open her masterly recital at the Baryshnikov Arts Center on Sunday with Bach’s Partita in A minor for solo flute, transposed into the key of G minor?

‘Why Grow Up?’ by Susan Neiman,2015-06-15,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Philosophy']","In her new book, the philosopher Susan Neiman takes on the predicament of maturity in an “infantile age” that dates back to the 18th century."," A great deal of modern popular culture — including just about everything pertaining to what French savants like to call le nouvel âge d’or de la comédie américaine — runs on the disavowal of maturity. The ideal consumer is a mirror image of a familiar comic archetype: a man-child sitting in his parents’ basement with his video games and his “Star Wars” figurines; a postgraduate girl and her pals treating the world as their playground. Baby boomers pursue perpetual youth into retirement. Gen-Xers hold fast to their skateboards, their Pixies T-shirts and their Beastie Boys CDs. Nobody wants to be an adult anymore, and every so often someone writes an article blaming Hollywood, attachment parenting, global capitalism or the welfare state for this catastrophe. I’ve written one or two of those myself. It’s not a bad racket, and since I’m intimately acquainted, on a professional basis, with the cinematic oeuvre of Adam Sandler, I qualify as something of an expert."

What’s on TV Tuesday,2015-06-16,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (TNT) PROOF Parachuting off Mount Everest doesn’t faze Ivan Turing, a tech wizard with a referential surname and a fondness for Steve Jobsian turtlenecks. But terminal cancer has given him pause. “I’ve always hated unknowns,” he tells Dr. Carolyn Tyler, a cardiothoracic surgeon with little patience for speculation and a wellspring of grief all her own. “And now that I’m facing the biggest one there is, I want to know what to expect.” His offer: He’ll give her control of his $10 billion estate if she’ll help him prove what, if anything, exists after the body flat lines. Beautiful minds (and some intriguingly nutty concepts) collide in this new series, which stars Jennifer Beals and Matthew Modine, and counts Kyra Sedgwick among its executive producers. As Dr. Tyler investigates the murky realm that believers call the afterlife, the doctor in her chafes at the notion that the nearly dead share experiences that science can’t explain. But as the mother of a teenage son killed a year earlier, she can’t help but want to believe herself."

Each year, the festival presents a different program on each of four consecutive weekends. If I lived in or near California, I would attend all four, every year. (The auditions alone are celebrated.)

Review: Vendela Vida’s ‘The Diver’s Clothes Lie Empty’ Offers Freedom to Escape,2015-06-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Ms. Vida’s fourth book is about a shifty American whose terrible decisions keep the narrative moving at a taut and suspenseful clip.,"Vendela Vida’s heroines have a particular talent for suffering. When their marriages cool or ancient family secrets worm into the light, these women take their troubles on holiday. They prefer to do their grieving somewhere picturesque: the Philippines (“And Now You Can Go,” 2003), Finland (“Let the Northern Lights Erase Your Name,” 2007), Turkey (“The Lovers,” 2010).

Nothing in them anticipates the smooth engineering of “The Diver’s Clothes Lie Empty,” her fourth and finest book, a taut, suspenseful story that ticks along with marvelous efficiency, like a little bomb."

"Classical Playlist: Sibelius, Dvorak and Zorn",2015-06-18,article,News,,"['Classical Music', 'Music']",Times critics share what they’ve been listening to lately.,"SIBELIUS: Complete Works for Mixed ChoirHeikki Seppanen, conductor; Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir(Ondine)If you mostly know Sibelius from his visionary symphonies, you might be surprised by the works on this two-disc set. The Finnish choral tradition was rich and active when Sibelius came of age as a composer in the late 1880s, and he wrote choral works all his life, from his student days in Helsinki until 1954 when, at 89 and three decades after his final symphony, he did an arrangement of a favorite Christmas song. The pieces on this rewarding recording range from folk songs suffused with Finnish character to enigmatic works with sometimes dark lyrics. There are festival and school songs, patriotic anthems, a cantata for an academic degree ceremony and, inevitably, two versions of “Finlandia.” Most of the pieces are a cappella. Many unfold in clear, block-chord settings of the texts. If you want to stump friends with a guessing game, play the beguiling, slightly strange “Glade of Tuoni” from this recording and ask them to identify the composer. You’ll win, as you will by picking up this album. (Anthony Tommasini)DVORAK: Symphony No. 9; VARÈSE: ‘Amériques’ Ludovic Morlot, conductor; Seattle Symphony(Seattle Symphony Media)It seems at first a bit perverse, pairing Dvorak’s warm and friendly “New World” Symphony with Varèse’s bellicose and blistering vision of new worlds. More fascinating in any case than the theme of the composers’ physical and psychic encounters with new worlds, whether fleeting or permanent, is the distance musical possibilities themselves had traveled in the mere three decades between the Dvorak (1893) and the Varèse (1922), the great watershed having been Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” (1913), which Varèse mines for all it is worth. The live performances here do equal justice to the coziness and the riotous upheavals. (James R. Oestreich)JOHN ZORN: ‘Hen to Pan’Jay Campbell, cello; Stephen Gosling, piano; Michael Nicolas, cello; Chris Otto, violin; Tyshawn Sorey, drums(Tzadik)The one constant in this feverishly changeable recording of recent chamber works is Mr. Campbell, an amazing musician who’s game for both Mr. Zorn’s technical challenges and his permeating intensity. Much of this album is taken up by three iterations of “Ouroboros” (2014), a seething, frenetic duet for two cellos that can also be performed with an improvising drummer (here the skittering Tyshawn Sorey). The poise of the gorgeous piano trio “The Aristos” (2014) and the delicacy of “Occam’s Razor” (2013), for cello and piano, are mixed in with uncertainty and collapse. The extremes to which Mr. Zorn flings his performers and listeners are not in themselves new, or newly juxtaposed, but he writes with such sensitivity, assurance and joy that it always somehow seems fresh.

Mr. Mazursky’s dramatically shaded comedy is somewhat of a feature-long tease, despite its famous image of the four lined up in bed. (Bob and company aren’t the swingers that they try to be.) But it’s also a sharp exploration of the kind of middle-class social anxieties that vibrate through “The Overnight.” "

Few Vehicles Equipped for Easy Car Seat Installation,2015-06-19,article,Brief,,"['Automobile Safety Features and Defects', 'Child Car Seats']",A study released on Thursday found that only a handful of vehicles deserved the highest rating for ease of child safety seat installation.,"A study released on Thursday found that only a handful of vehicles deserved the highest rating for ease of child safety seat installation. The study, conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, rated 102 vehicles on how easily a child safety seat could be installed. It focused on the vehicles’ so-called Latch system, which consists of three anchors that the seat is secured to. Only three models received the highest rating of Good: the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class and the Volkswagen Passat. Children are safer when in an age-appropriate child restraint, but these are not always easy to install, especially when using a vehicle’s seatbelts. And if the restraint is not properly anchored to the vehicle, a child could be severely injured in a crash. The federally mandated Latch system, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children, was meant to be easier than using seatbelts to attach safety seats. "

It was that church’s long history of spiritual autonomy and political activism that caught the attention of the white vigilantes who gunned him down and rode away. Randolph’s fate was repeated yesterday with the murder of nine people, including the pastor of the church, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who, like Randolph, also served as a state senator."

How to Train a Cadaver Dog,2015-06-19,article,News,,"['Dogs', 'Death and Dying', 'Smells and Odors', 'Cadavers']",Find an incurious animal. Use your own blood.,"“Drug dogs are trained on drugs, and cadaver dogs are trained on cadaver,” says Mary E. Cablk, a scientist at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada who studies scent detection. Training a cadaver dog requires regular contact with human blood, decaying flesh and bones. In the United States, dog handlers can legally obtain bodily components like human placenta and blood, but not always easily, and trainers like Cablk often resort to using their own blood. Some substitute commercially available ersatz odors (the most common is Sigma Pseudo Corpse Scent, which comes in three kinds: recently dead, decomposed and drowned). But deceased humans produce unique volatile organic compounds, and canines have a keenly attuned sense of smell, so you should practice on the real thing. “You don’t want to put other people at risk,” Cablk says — searches are often in dangerous areas, like collapsed buildings — “to find what is ultimately a dead pet.”"

White, black and acid yellow, it has eyes like tiny silver coins, and it is wiping its downcurved beak on a branch of a shrub with strappy leaves.

With a million or more Soviet troops occupying the three Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, the Soviet-German pact of non-aggression of last August, which at no time was based on anything more substantial than opportunism, appeared to have been liquidated in fact though not in theory."

She is chatting with the personal bodyguard of an American movie star. The bodyguard describes his interest in the evolutionary theory of “punctuated equilibrium,” in which species, faced with a dramatic change in their circumstances, adapt rapidly. The young woman, who is being vetted for the part of stand-in to the famous actress in a film being shot in Casablanca, feigns amiable curiosity. She is desperate to appear sufficiently sane and normal to get the job; she doesn’t want the bodyguard to realize that she herself is living proof of “punctuated equilibrium,” that the sequence of events that have occurred in the 48 hours since her arrival in Casablanca have propelled this previously unremarkable woman into committing a series of frauds that could get her into an awful lot of trouble."

I don’t think you can be taught.”","Born Funny: The actress and comedian Ali Wentworth hits this week’s hardcover nonfiction list with “Happily Ali After” (new at No. 13), an essay collection about her mostly sincere efforts at self-­improvement as her 50th birthday approached. “I realized I faced some obstacles in my path to spiritual enlightenment,” she writes in the introduction. “I have been accused of being cynical and jaded on this particular subject. I don’t read self-help books, except the ones that guarantee I’ll lose 40 pounds in one hour. And I enjoy being co­dependent. My best life is never going to resemble, say, Angelina Jolie’s; I don’t have the cheekbones, can’t fly my own plane, and refugees make me too sad. But perhaps I could step up the consciousness a notch.” This is Wentworth’s second book, after the 2012 best seller “Ali in Wonderland,” a comic memoir about her political childhood (her mother was Nancy Reagan’s social secretary), her Hollywood career and her life as Mrs. George Stephanopoulos. That book’s fans included Jackie Collins — who called it, in these pages, the funniest thing she had ever read — and Charlie Rose, who on his show asked Wentworth where her sense of humor came from. “I was born funny,” she told him. “I think it’s instinctual. I don’t think you can be taught. . . . And I love being unscripted. I mean, this kind of thing to me is one of my favorite things to do. I don’t think you’re going to see me on ‘Law and Order: SVU’ any time soon, you know.”"

"‘All Involved,’ by Ryan Gattis",2015-06-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Old rivalries surface amid the 1992 Los Angeles riots.,"In recent years, riot footage has practically become a subgenre of documentary filmmaking. We recognize the hallmarks — advancing police phalanxes, protesters in retreat, looters, burning cruisers, ­cameras tracking airborne projectiles — without always understanding the causes. While the 1992 Los Angeles riots lacked the exhaustive citizen reportage of more recent incidents, there was enough videotape running back then to give the rest of the country the lasting impression of a restless city entirely engulfed in chaos. In his latest novel, “All Involved,” Ryan Gattis imagines a narrative that, while mostly tangential to that chaos, attempts to give it more meaningful context through personalization. "

"‘More Happy Than Not,’ by Adam Silvera",2015-06-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A Bronx teenager struggles with sexuality and painful memories in this debut young adult novel.,"If only for the outsize cultural imprint left by “The Hunger Games,” it is reasonable to argue that young adult fiction has done a far more aggressive job grappling with social inequality than much of what is rendered today in the name of literary fiction, a world where poor and ­working-class characters are so often visible merely at the periphery, if they are visible at all. The novel “Panic,” for example, by the best-selling Y.A. author Lauren Oliver, is set in a small town so devoid of prospects that graduating seniors spend their time battling it out in a game whose grand prize is the unimaginable sum of $67,000. In Laurie Halse Anderson’s “The Impossible Knife of Memory,” a teenager returns home after several years on the road with her truck-driver father, an Iraq war veteran who suffers from PTSD. We are far, in other words, from the moneyed insularities of Exeter."

What’s On TV Sunday,2015-06-21,article,Schedule,,['Television'],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) TRUE DETECTIVE Three law enforcement officers (Colin Farrell, above; Rachel McAdams; and Taylor Kitsch) in a fictional Los Angeles suburb and a career criminal (Vince Vaughn) trying to go legit collide when a city manager is murdered — and a lucrative land scheme disrupted — in Season 2 of this anthology series, created and written by Nic Pizzolatto. “This time, Mr. Pizzolatto doubles down on much of what made the first season so distinctive,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “That doesn’t make it twice as good, though. Not nearly.” In the premiere of “Ballers,” at 10, Dwayne Johnson plays a former football pro trying to build a career out of giving financial advice to current players in Miami. The characters’ shenanigans make for “unrewarding, predictable drama, though the writers occasionally try for better,” Neil Genzlinger wrote. And in “The Brink,” a dark comedy at 10:30, the fate of the world rests in the hands of the secretary of state (Tim Robbins), a lowly foreign service officer (Jack Black) and a Navy fighter pilot (Pablo Schreiber) after a rogue general (Iqbal Theba) seizes control of Pakistan and its nuclear arsenal. The writers don’t go very near Islamic extremism or terrorism, Ms. Stanley wrote. “Instead,” she said, “the creators of ‘Brink’ take aim at American wrongdoing. So nobody is going to get in trouble because of this show. But people aren’t going to die laughing, either.” "

In a statement, he said the former justice, Marie Deschamps, would be joined on the panel by Hassan Jallow of Gambia, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda; and Yasmin Sooka, the executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa. Mr. Ban created the panel because of questions over whether United Nations rights officials had acted appropriately when they learned of the accusations. The abuse is alleged to have taken place from December 2013 into mid-2014. Although the organization was quick to investigate the allegations, the French authorities did not learn about them until last July, when a United Nations human rights officer leaked the report to them.

"In Pittsburgh, One Baker Requires a Whole Year to Create the Perfect Loaf",2015-06-23,article,News,,[],A centuries-old technique and carefully developed ingredients go into each batch of Bread and Salt bread.,"Barely six months old, Pittsburgh’s Bread and Salt bakery is fast becoming known for its pane locale (local bread), made in a former slaughterhouse in the centuries-old Italian baking tradition of using organic flour, natural fermentation and local grain. Its owner and founder, the baker Rick Easton, acknowledges that the loaves’ “ugly, formless and dark” appearance belies their addictive flavor — which he accredits to the 100% stone-milled, high-extraction wheat flour crop he develops with a farmer in Weatherbury Farms in Avella, Pa. At the beginning of the season, Easton experiments with different wheat crops and handling techniques to find the right texture for bread he will serve that year. The result is a pane that feels like whole wheat, but the germ is retained so that the richness and natural oils produce “an incredible amount of flavor and sweetness. From a customer’s perspective, it’s great to be able to think about wheat in that way,” Easton explains. “People are used to this supermarket bread that has a two-hour process. My process is 24 hours, and then we’re talking about crop planning that went in a year ago. So last year, someone was thinking about the grain that you would eat today.” Below, Easton shares a recipe for enjoying his signature loaf — or your own favorite, local bread."

A secret court agreed, ordering phone companies to serve up our records on an “ongoing daily basis’’ — 24 hours a day, hundreds of billions of calls in all. No one knew about it until Edward Snowden revealed the existence of the program in 2013. Earlier this month, President Obama signed the USA Freedom Act, which is supposed to close this loophole. Will it? That depends on a fresh pile of fine print."

For the first years of his life, he had been witness to his father’s alcoholic binges, which often involved shouting, breaking objects and hitting John and his mother. His mother struggled too, with depression and a crack addiction. When John was 5, the state’s Child Protective Services removed him from the home and placed him in a series of foster-care arrangements. Although his father disappeared, never to be heard from again, his mother underwent court-mandated substance-abuse treatment and was later allowed to see John in supervised visits. Eventually, she regained custody — which was right before he and I met."

Freud, who was 44, was just beginning to practice psychoanalysis, a form of therapy that would become known as ‘the talking cure.’ The girl, whom Freud would later refer to as ‘‘Dora,’’ had a cluster of inexplicable symptoms: Her mood was low, she was prone to losing consciousness and, for weeks at a time, she could not speak above a whisper. Freud diagnosed hysteria, a term commonly used in fin de siècle Europe to refer to a disorder in which psychological stress was expressed through physical symptoms. Freud traced Dora’s condition in part to her father’s sexual infidelities that she had felt obliged, from early adolescence, to help orchestrate. When Dora told Freud, in the course of the analysis, that her father’s friend — Herr K., a married man decades her senior — had accosted her in his empty office building, trying to kiss her on her lips, Freud, trained in biology and swept up in his own scientific detachment, couldn’t empathize with her distress.

In that sense, the Malian photographer Seydou Keïta was — like his father, who worked as a blacksmith, carpenter, mechanic and electrician, among other jobs — a craftsman. He was paid by the public to make pictures. But like his esteemed Malian compatriot Malick Sidibé, Mama Casset of Senegal and Joseph Moise Agbodjelou of Benin, he produced such fine work that we now consider him a great African artist. These master photographers gave us panoramas of life in Bamako, Dakar and Porto-Novo, a vivid record of individual people, largely shorn of their names and stories but irrepressibly alive. Here are good clothes gracefully cut, glowing skin, beautifully coifed hair, polished shoes: all the familiar markers of a person taking pride in his or her appearance. Here’s someone who looks witty, here’s another who looks querulous, another who’s modest, or vain, or sweet. There we see a renegade bra strap slipping off a shoulder, there a large laughing man with a baby, a woman in a bathing suit, youths partying at night with their Afros, bell-bottoms, precious LPs and endless reserves of cool."

She gives lectures and has a self-help book coming out soon. One of her minor themes concerns our deceased father and is particularly nasty. Although there is no way to positively refute statements she has made, neither I nor my two brothers and my mother believe my father capable of the events my sister describes. My father was a kind and giving person. He has living brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews who loved him dearly and would be very upset by my sister’s claims. My husband suggests I confront my sister, but that will most likely not yield a fruitful outcome or change anything. My concern is to protect positive memories. I propose to write about him myself, posting my memories on the Internet. I would not attempt to refute my sister, merely focus on my father and memories of him. This seems the least aggressive path and least likely to create any stir around my sister or her supporters.

‘Listening to Stone: The Art and Life of Isamu Noguchi’,2015-06-25,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Art', 'Sculpture']",A biography of the great border-crossing sculptor.,"The art of biography is not unlike the creation of sculpture. Out of a raw material of artifact and anecdote must emerge the semblance of living form. There may be no one right way to animate such matter. Certainly, there are plenty of wrongs: from hazy abstraction to overwrought realism, from misapplied attention to mannered application. Whatever the approach, however, the spirit of the subject must somehow guide the telling. For Isamu Noguchi, the great border-crossing sculptor of the last century, the art came, he said, from tapping into “the materiality of stone, its essence, to reveal its identity — not what might be imposed but something closer to its being.” The genius of “Listening to Stone: The Art and Life of Isamu Noguchi” is how its author, Hayden Herrera, inhabits the sculpturing hand of its subject. Rather than focus on the surface, Herrera gets “beneath the skin,” as Noguchi would say, to the “brilliance of matter.”"

This has made them convenient and marketable, while draining away their revolutionary content. The art market embraced the products of every “ism” as soon as it recognized its distinct style. The only avant-garde that escaped the zombie line is Dada. "

And one idea that really applied to modern romance, in my opinion, was this whole notion of the paradox of choice. . . . Right now we have the most romantic options that any generation has ever had. And you would think, oh, more options, that’s better. But whenever you look at any studies they’ve done, they always find the more options people have, the harder it is for them to make a choice, and that when they do make a choice they’re less satisfied because they’re scared that they maybe chose the wrong thing. And whenever we talked to people about this in regards to dating, it totally resonated.”"

‘Women Artists: The Linda Nochlin Reader’,2015-06-25,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Art']",A collection of 30 essays by the pioneer scholar of feminist art history Linda Nochlin.,"In 1971, Linda Nochlin published her groundbreaking article “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?,” a passionate and rigorous attack on nearly all the received ideas of her day. While it was necessary (she argued) to question “the unstated domination of white male subjectivity” that shaped the art historical canon, she found equally suspect the feminist impulse to resurrect forgotten or underappreciated women artists and elevate devalued “feminine” qualities. To get to the heart of the problem, it was necessary to question the notion of “greatness” or “genius” itself. Nochlin was then 40 years old. Two years before, she had experienced a feminist awakening when an acquaintance gave her a briefcase of radical feminist zines. A twice-married mother of two, teaching art history at Vassar College and leading what she had considered until then a fashionable and liberated life, she read until 2 a.m., light bulbs going off in her head. “I kept opening doors,” she would write later, “onto an endless series of bright rooms, each one opening off from the next, each promising a new revelation.”"

The feeling didn’t conform to strictly partisan lines, and the objects of wrath included bêtes noires of both the left and the right: banks, oil companies, federal and state governments, news media. At Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, a Tea Party couple visiting from rural Virginia was surprised to find a patch of common ground with Occupiers — at least until the discussion turned to actual policies.
