This past summer, I went swimming for the first time since going on hormones. From a boat, Nan took a picture that is precious to me.

I was doing a fitting for Marc Jacobs’s fall 2017 runway show, and couldn’t understand what anyone was saying and why I was waiting around for three hours. It was nothing like Seoul Fashion Week. My phone died. I started to panic. But then, another Korean model approached me and comforted me. She invited me to sit with her and let me borrow her phone charger. She translated the announcements and told me when it was my turn to be fitted. That woman was HoYeon Jung — she was a year older than I was, and it was her third New York Fashion Week. In Korean culture, we take care of each other, especially when we’re working overseas. We commute to fittings and eat together between shows. I met EZ six years ago at a party in Seoul, and when we went to New York for fashion week, we lived together for the whole season and got really close. I met Chloe recently in New York, but I already consider her a younger sister. What I’ve longed for over the past year has been that sense of community, of going out in Seoul with EZ and my other model friends, like Sora Choi and Yoon Young Bae. We’d meet in Gangnam, where most of us live, and from there we’d have dinner — usually street food, like tteokbokki [a spicy rice cake], dakbal [spicy chicken feet] or Korean barbecue — then bowling, karaoke and bar hopping until we’d end up at one of our apartments to play drinking games and card games, like Go Stop. I’d often end up going home when people were heading to work. I really miss those days."

In this nimble mesh of stories, a trading empire can have its roots in something as simple as the theft of a wig.

Since the start of the pandemic, his social interactions have become severely reduced, limited to daily calls from me (I live across the country), weekly visits from my brother and the occasional shopping trips and church attendance. As our mother passed away before the pandemic, his one loyal companion has been his iPad and YouTube.

Every time my brother or I have a conversation with him, he talks politics and pushes his views, and even after we asked him to stop, he tries to get the last word in by sending us angry emails or texts. Now both of us try to avoid having any interactions with him. I have the password to his YouTube account from a year ago when I helped him with a tech problem. In order to preserve our relationship, I’m thinking about going into his account to delete and pause his viewing history, and perhaps put in some links to more wholesome entertainment such as music and soccer to counter the constant bombardment of extremism. My justification is that if he is being brainwashed by an algorithm, then I might as well use the algorithm to steer him back to his old self so that we can at least have a normal conversation.

How Bad Is Our Pandemic Drinking Problem?,2021-04-21,article,News,,"['Alcohol Abuse', 'Quarantine (Life and Culture)', 'Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)', 'Anxiety and Stress', 'Women and Girls']","The past year has changed alcohol use patterns, especially among women. The impacts probably won’t be fully known for years.","Even before the pandemic began, some Americans were drinking significantly more alcohol than they had in decades past — with damaging consequences. In 2020, researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (N.I.A.A.A.) found that from 1999 through 2017, per capita consumption increased by 8 percent and the number of alcohol-related deaths doubled, many caused by liver disease. The trends are particularly concerning for women: Whereas the number of men who reported any drinking stayed mostly the same, the proportion of women who did so increased 10 percent, and the number of women who reported binge drinking, or consuming roughly four or more drinks in about two hours, increased by 23 percent. (For men, binge drinking is about five or more drinks in that period.) Current dietary guidelines consider moderate drinking to be at most one drink a day for women and two for men."

Celebrities, cinematic characters and figures from commercials often appear: stars from Quentin Tarantino films with hulking shoulders and slender legs; Lolita-like blondes in sunglasses; Serena Williams hammering a tennis ball into the air.

Among them are the myriad atrocities perpetuated against Indigenous people in what we now call America (and beyond), individuals whose experiences are to this day too often distorted or left untold. Lately, though, there have been some hard-won gains on that front, from professional sports teams finally changing their names to the Metropolitan Museum of Art hiring Patricia Marroquin Norby as its first curator of Native American Art.

For this story, we asked 10 queer Indigenous talents from different parts of North America to share one of their artworks and talk about its genesis, and about their practice at large. Like the selections themselves, the conversations, which touched on materials, color schemes, gender fluidity, decolonization, oral history and more, were testaments to the strength — and beauty — of a multiplicity of voices."
