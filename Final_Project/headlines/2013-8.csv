He holds a citywide job, public advocate, that, while not very demanding, is nominally next in line to the mayor. From that post he has been none-too-subtly campaigning for the top job since 2010. As the city emerges from 20 years of Republican and independent leadership and shows its true colors — which are, by most indications, deep blue — candidates don’t come much bluer than Bill de Blasio."

What’s on Monday,2013-08-05,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10:30 P.M. (Showtime 2) 2 DAYS IN NEW YORK (2012) Julie Delpy directed and stars in this tale about 48 hours in the life of Marion, a high-strung photographer; her partner, Mingus (Chris Rock, above left, with Ms. Delpy, right, Talen Ruth Riley and Owen Shipman), a journalist and radio host; and their two children from previous relationships, as they all deal with the arrival of Marion’s Parisian family members, who proceed to drive the couple crazy. Marion’s father (played by Ms. Delpy’s father, Albert) is detained at the airport for trying to enter the United States with cheese and sausage taped to his body; her sister (Alexia Landeau) and her sister’s boyfriend (Alex Nahon) smoke weed in an elevator and have noisy sex in the bathroom, possibly involving Mingus’s electric toothbrush. “The driving crazy part is hilarious and persuasive, partly because Ms. Delpy and her cast depart from the usual caricatures of Frenchness while still engaging in broad, silly satire,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And although Marion and Mingus “never quite seem like a credible, comfortable couple,” he added, the film’s best parts “are those that cast an affectionate, unsentimental eye on the city, which looks lived-in, real and nonmythical, the way that Paris often looks in French movies and New York rarely does in Hollywood confections.”"

What’s on Tuesday,2013-08-06,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"6:50 A.M. (Cinemax) MATCH POINT (2005) Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish tennis player recently retired from the professional circuit, climbs the British social ladder after taking a job at a London club, helping its rich members polish their strokes. Soon, he has befriended Tom (Matthew Goode), an heir to a business fortune; has wooed his sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer); and maneuvered himself into the family firm and into the family as Tom’s brother-in-law. But then Chris meets Tom’s fiancée, a scrappy American actress, Nola (Scarlett Johansson, above, with Mr. Rhys Meyers), and suddenly the temperature of his life increases from a polite simmer to a full sexual boil. “What passes between Chris and Nola is not only desire, but also recognition, which makes their connection especially volatile,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, describing this drama as “a Champagne cocktail laced with strychnine.” He added: “As their affair advances, Ms. Johansson and Mr. Rhys Meyers manage some of the best acting seen in a Woody Allen movie in a long time, escaping the archness and emotional disconnection that his writing often imposes. It is possible to identify with both of them — and to feel an empathetic twinge as they are ensnared in the consequences of their own heedlessness — without entirely liking either one. But it is the film’s brisk, chilly precision that makes it so bracingly pleasurable. The gloom of random, meaningless existence has rarely been so much fun, and Mr. Allen’s bite has never been so sharp, or so deep. A movie this good is no laughing matter.” "

"With Cooked Tomatoes, Stick With Cool Reds or Rosé",2013-08-06,article,News,,"['Wines', 'Tomatoes']","A wide range of wines can work to complement a mellow tomato crostata, though cool reds fare best.","Raw tomatoes, high in acid, demand high-acid wines. But cooked-tomato dishes like this crostata are altogether mellower, and so welcome a wider range of wines. A high-acid wine like an unoaked barbera from Asti or Alba would still go beautifully, but so would a Sicilian nerello mascalese from Mount Etna or a good Provençal rosé. Serve the reds cool. White wines would work well, too, like a falanghina or fiano di Avellino from Campania, or a good sauvignon blanc on the herbal side.

But as the boy eats his first oyster, tastes his first beer and learns how to steer a car, he also ends up being an accomplice — and perhaps a hostage — to a man who turns out to be a desperate criminal. “Mr. Candis, who wrote the script with Justin Wilson, balances the more sensationalistic aspects of the movie — guns are pointed and fired, blood is shed, and threats are issued with heavy, macho menace — with keen attention to details of character and place,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The landscape of Baltimore’s African-American neighborhoods may be familiar to fans of ‘The Wire’ (as will the faces of a few of the actors), but ‘Luv’ is telling a different kind of tale about drugs, the law and urban life.

For what it’s worth, I think Glasner makes a good case that Friedman was indeed more or less a Keynesian, or maybe Hicksian — certainly that was the message everyone took from his Monetary Framework, which was disappointingly conventional. And Friedman’s attempts to claim that Keynes added little that wasn’t already in a Chicago oral tradition don’t hold up well either."

Still, they — we — are dependent to an uncomfortable extent on the world’s judgment, perhaps hoping that by some fluke the world will rate us higher than we rate ourselves. The problem is not that the world so often ignores literary effort (though that is certainly the case), but that to the degree it breaks its silence it tends to distribute the rewards in a mystifyingly erratic manner.

Raw Materials,2013-08-09,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A memoir, presented as a self-interview, by the Nobel laureate Imre Kertesz.","Two of the great pessimistic proclamations of 20th-century literature — Adorno’s “To write a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric” and Beckett’s “I can’t go on, I’ll go on” — have at least one thing in common. They both address the inadequacy of language to articulate reality. Better to say nothing, they both say, or at least that’s the first half of what they say. If Adorno leaves off the productive half of the equation — “I’ll go on” — other writers have supplied it for him, in the form of a very large body of work concerned with the Holocaust that is not only ethically accountable but also incredibly rich and inventive. In fact it is not too much to claim, of Holocaust literature, that the struggle to say what is unsayable has paradoxically yielded some of the most extraordinary literary works we have."

It’s been a fascinating journey because it forced me to look at the Middle East through the lens of Arab environmentalists instead of politicians.

The notion that securing the interests of any single group — Shiite or Sunni, Christian or Muslim, secular or Islamist — over the health of the commons is nuts to them.

What’s On Sunday,2013-08-11,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (AMC) LOW WINTER SUN Frank Agnew (Mark Strong), a Detroit homicide detective with a tragic past, is persuaded by a colleague, Joe Geddes (Lennie James, above), to help him kill another cop, who he claims murdered a loved one of Frank’s. But as holes surface in Joe’s story, Frank starts to worry that he has been played in this new series, based on a 2006 British mini-series of the same title. Ruben Santiago-Hudson portrays the precinct commander, who assigns Frank to lead the investigation into the cop’s death. David Costabile is an Internal Affairs detective delving into corruption. And James Ransone is a thug who, with his wife (Sprague Grayden), and a police officer on his payroll, looks to set up a drug and prostitution business. “It’s a deadly serious drama, but some of the early scenes are so overwrought that they are almost laughable,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. The series, she said, “doesn’t need to overreach. It has an intriguing story, an aptly sinister setting and an excellent cast.” She added: “It’s inevitable for viewers to yearn for the kind of odyssey that series like ‘The Wire’ and ‘Breaking Bad’ provided. ‘Low Winter Sun’ isn’t that, but it’s an entertaining way station.” The fifth, and final, season premiere of “Breaking Bad” leads in at 9. “Talking Bad,” a companion show hosted by Chris Hardwick that analyzes the series’s last eight episodes, follows at 11."

What’s on Thursday,2013-08-15,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"4:15 P.M. (Sundance) ORLANDO (1993) A beautiful young nobleman (Tilda Swinton, above) adored by an aging Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp) falls asleep one night in the 17th century and wakes up five days later as a woman. “Same person, no difference at all,” she says, unflustered. “Just a different sex.” She continues to learn about life through the centuries up until the present, pondering the differences between men and women — as well as their similarities — in this adaptation by Sally Potter of Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel. Charlotte Valandrey plays Sasha, a wanton Muscovite princess with whom the male Orlando falls in love. Billy Zane is the American with whom Orlando’s female version has a more enduring if less sexually demanding relationship. “This ravishing and witty spectacle invades the mind through eyes that are dazzled without ever being anesthetized,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “Throughout Ms. Potter’s ‘Orlando,’ as in Woolf’s, there are a piercing kind of common sense and a joy that, because they are so rare these days in any medium, create their own kind of cinematic suspense and delightedly surprised laughter. ‘Orlando’ could well become a classic of a very special kind, not mainstream perhaps, but a model for independent filmmakers who follow their own irrational muses, sometimes to unmourned obscurity, occasionally to glory.” More than anything else, he added: “ ‘Orlando’ is Ms. Swinton’s triumph. With the firmest but lightest of touches, she has spun gossamer.”"

But there were drawbacks: the chair began to stink after a few days, and it weighed 300 pounds. “Unless you had a forklift in your living room, it was an impossible piece of furniture,” he says. Hall switched to water as his filler. And he decided to build a mattress instead of a chair; since people rarely move their beds, the weight wouldn’t matter so much. Plus, he says,“It’s the piece of furniture you spend the most amount of time in.”"

Jesus Under the Microscope,2013-08-16,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Reza Aslan’s “Zealot” is a reminder that books on the historical Jesus have been popular for a very long time.,"Reza Aslan’s “Zealot” reaching the top of the best-seller list is a reminder that books on the historical Jesus have been popular for a very long time. In 1846, George Eliot translated “Life of Jesus, Critically Examined,” by David Friedrich Strauss, from German into English. Nearly 150 years later, Evelyn Toynton, writing about “Jesus: A Life” for the Book Review in 1992, said A. N. Wilson’s study “does not pretend to add much to the scholarship on the subject.” According to Toynton’s reading, Wilson, like Aslan, argued that Jesus “never saw himself as anything but a Jew or desired any following among the gentiles,” and “was crucified as a terrorist, not as a religious figure.”"

Underground Idol,2013-08-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A group of investigators pursues a horror auteur known for shunning the public eye.,"The true believers come out at night. They meet in condemned buildings marked by the symbol of a stylized eye to watch a “night film” — one of the psychologically punishing horror pictures of Stanislas Cordova, a master filmmaker who has shunned publicity with a zeal that makes Thomas Pynchon look like a shameless attention hog. Adding to the mystique is a sense that Cordova might have retreated because he has something unsavory to hide. Bad things happen to those who try to pick his locked closet for a look at the skeletons. Consider the star reporter Scott McGrath, who plunged into disgrace after a preliminary investigation into Cordova’s secrets blew up in his face. McGrath has a score to settle, so when Cordova’s achingly gifted daughter turns up dead in a Manhattan ruin, it’s Take 2 for the unemployed journalist. Nor is McGrath the only one who wants to know what’s been going on behind the camera; in short order he’s joined by a shabby but smoldering drug dealer named Hopper and a breathless ingénue, Nora Halliday. Together, the three make an adorably awkward family of misfits, who will be even more appealing should George Clooney, Ryan Gosling and Alison Brie be cast for the movie adaptation."

On Foreign Shores,2013-08-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Paul Yoon’s novel, a Korean refugee arrives in Brazil seeking a fresh start.","A number of remarkable short novels have emerged in the recent past: “Tinkers,” by Paul Harding; “Train Dreams,” by Denis Johnson; “The Sojourn,” by Andrew Krivak; “The Buddha in the Attic,” by Julie Otsuka. Far from slight, they all deal with large themes and subjects that could easily fill 500-page books, yet have been compressed into poemlike works. Page count is one of the most prosaic ways to categorize a book, but it points to the fact that one approaches these works differently — the experience more akin to reading poetry or short fiction, where what is left out is at least as important as what remains. With “Snow Hunters,” Paul Yoon proves himself well suited to the short form."
Service Jobs,2013-08-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The young men who narrate Saïd Sayrafiezadeh’s stories sign up to fight in a war as a way of escaping corporate servitude.,"In his beguiling 2009 memoir, “When Skateboards Will Be Free,” Saïd Sayrafiezadeh recounted being raised by devout members of the Socialist Workers Party. His Jewish mother did the actual raising; his Iranian-born father abandoned the family for the cause. Both believed a workers’ revolution was imminent.

Fruit of Knowledge,2013-08-16,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In examining the ways stories keep us company during crises, Rebecca Solnit creates links between seemingly disparate ideas.","Rebecca Solnit’s latest book, a series of essays loosely about story­telling, has a table of contents that sits on the page like a mountain tipped on its side. The essays’ titles mirror or refract one another, imparting symmetry. The summit, a chapter titled “Knot,” evokes another of the book’s metaphors, the bringing together of narrative threads. The tipped mountain shape resembles the traditional rise and fall of story structure.

What’s on Saturday,2013-08-17,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"7:30 P.M. (HBO) ANNA KARENINA (2012) Keira Knightley, above, stars as Anna, the bored wife of a virtuous government official (Jude Law) in mid-19th-century Imperial Russia, who travels from St. Petersburg to Moscow to calm a marital storm in the household of her philandering brother (Matthew Macfadyen) in Joe Wright’s stagy adaptation of the Tolstoy novel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the man who captures her heart: Count Vronsky, a young military officer with the eyes of a poet and a domineering mother (Olivia Williams). And Alicia Vikander is Kitty, a lovely young woman adored by Levin, the gloomy rural landowner (Domhnall Gleeson) widely understood to be Tolstoy’s alter ego, with his idea of love — an ennobling union of souls — serving as a rebuke to the amorality festering in cities. “I assume you know that it ends badly, but Mr. Wright’s real interest, like Tolstoy’s, is in everything that happens in between Anna’s first meeting with Vronsky and her final encounter with the wheels of a train,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And while Mr. Wright’s screen versions of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” and Ian McEwan’s “Atonement” “remain trapped in literariness,” he added, “Mr. Wright’s ‘Anna Karenina’ is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly — wonderfully — crazy terms. Pious Tolstoyans may knit their brows about the stylistic liberties Mr. Wright and the screenwriter, Tom Stoppard, have taken, but surely Tolstoy can withstand (and may indeed benefit from) their playful, passionate rendering of his masterpiece.” Jacqueline Durran won an Oscar for costume design."

What’s On Sunday,2013-08-18,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (13, 49) THE LADY VANISHES In this “Masterpiece Mystery!” movie, based on Ethel Lina White’s 1936 novel, “The Wheel Spins,” from which Alfred Hitchcock adapted his 1938 thriller, “The Lady Vanishes,” Iris Carr (Tuppence Middleton, above, with Tom Hughes), a beautiful young socialite, is befriended on a train by an older Englishwoman named Miss Froy (Selina Cadell), who then disappears — after which Iris’s fellow passengers deny she ever existed. Only Max Hare (Mr. Hughes), the infatuated engineer, pays heed to Iris’s conviction. Is it fair to compare this film with Hitchcock’s? Mike Hale asked in The New York Times. “It doesn’t really matter, because if you’ve seen the original, it’s impossible to do otherwise,” he decided. “This new ‘Lady Vanishes,’ directed by Diarmuid Lawrence (‘South Riding’) from a screenplay by Fiona Seres, is a perfectly adequate television mystery of the week.

What’s On Tuesday,2013-08-20,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Sundance) THE PLAYER (1992) In this film directed by Robert Altman, Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), the head of production at a large Hollywood studio, tries to fend off a young genius (Peter Gallagher) rumored to have been hired as his replacement while figuring out who is writing him poison-pen postcards. When the hate mail’s author — a screenwriter (Vincent D’Onofrio) Griffin failed to get back to — turns up dead, he becomes a suspect, partly for falling in love with the writer’s girlfriend (Greta Scacchi, above, with Mr. Robbins). Whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Lovett play the detectives who make Griffin squirm. “As a satire, ‘The Player’ tickles,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “It doesn’t draw blood.” Mr. Altman’s most subversive message, he added, “is not that it’s possible to get away with murder in Hollywood, but that the most grievous sin, in Hollywood terms anyway, is to make a film that flops.” In “Short Cuts” (1993), at 10:15, Mr. Altman intertwines the experiences of Los Angelenos in adaptations of Raymond Carver stories. Mr. Robbins reappears as a philandering motorcycle cop who can’t be faithful to the woman (Frances McDormand) with whom he’s cheating on his wife (Madeleine Stowe). Lily Tomlin is a diner cook who hits a small boy with her car. Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell are his parents; Mr. Lovett is the baker who makes his birthday cake. Fred Ward, Buck Henry and Huey Lewis are three pals who find a dead woman while fishing. And Jennifer Jason Leigh is a mother who supports her family by doing phone sex, sometimes while washing dishes or changing diapers. “The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done,” Mr. Canby wrote. “When future social historians want to know what the temper of life was like in one corner of America in 1993, ‘Short Cuts’ will be a mother lode of information. It’s also a terrific movie.” "

These usually consist of three or four different types of frittata and they are different from the stack of thin frittatas that I learned to make years ago. Traditionally you would make these simply by making the frittatas, leaving them a little runny on the top and stacking them, then finishing the stack in the oven or just weighting it with a plate and chilling. But it’s easier and faster (though still quite time consuming) if you’re making the crespéu in a breadpan or tureen to cook the eggs and filling like runny scrambled eggs and layer each batch in a breadpan, then bake in a water bath. You can use 3 eggs in each batch instead of 4, but the layers will be thinner."

At the most fundamental level, you can’t guarantee adequate health care to everyone unless the people who don’t need help right now — the young, healthy, and affluent — are induced, one way or another, to contribute to the care of those who do need help. You can do this purely with taxes, via a single-payer system (and maybe even by having the government act as provider), or you can do it, Swiss or Massachusetts style, via a combination of regulation, taxes, and subsidies. But some way of corralling the lucky healthy into contributing is necessary."

"36 Hours in Izmir, Turkey",2013-08-21,article,News,,['Travel and Vacations'],"This sunny seaside city offers everything from a traditional bazaar to bars to boutiques, and serves as a gateway to the ruins of ancient Ephesus.","“Infidel Izmir.” That’s the nickname that was long ago bestowed on Turkey’s third-largest metropolis. Known for most of its history as Smyrna, this port city was, in Ottoman times, a melting pot that included Greeks, Armenians, Jews, French and Italians. Today’s Izmir is largely Turkish, but the moniker lingers. For religious Turks, the label seems appropriate for this sunny, palm-fringed seaside city, with its relaxed attitudes and many nonobservant Muslims. For most residents, though, the nickname is proof of Izmir’s progressiveness. Reverential images of Ataturk, the founder of modern secular Turkey, are everywhere, and in June many in the city protested against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan after his Islamist-inspired government cracked down on peaceful demonstrators in Istanbul who had mobilized to save a city park from developers. Izmir — which is among four international cities that are vying to hold the World Expo in 2020 — has much to offer visitors: a renovated waterfront, an ever-evolving night-life district and slick new design hotels. Meanwhile, a vast traditional bazaar and the spectacular nearby ruins of Ephesus bear witness to a rich past."

"Privileged, but Wired Not to Find Comfort",2013-08-22,article,Review,,['Movies'],"“Thérèse,” set in 1920s France, revolves around an upper-class woman for whom happiness is elusive.","The rich are different from you and me, as F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, sometimes nowhere more so than in French movies. In the United States, a Viking stove in the kitchen and a BMW in the driveway may be mere background noise in a sleek thriller; in France, such emblems of class privilege can be grounds for a date with the Widow (a k a the guillotine), metaphorically speaking. In “Thérèse,” a 1920s woman is driven to commit a terrible crime, for all sorts of nominal reasons, though, in truth, her paramount motive is the accident of her birth: she’s bourgeois."

"Jimmy Connors, Ladies’ Man",2013-08-23,article,News,,['Tennis'],He learned to play a “woman’s game” to beat men. Apparently it wasn’t enough to help him last more than one match as Maria Sharapova’s coach.,"Technically, Jimmy Connors wasn’t the most overwhelming player. He was on the slight side; his serve was so-so, his forehand questionable. His only truly great stroke was his two-handed backhand. That he managed to win eight Grand Slam events (five U.S. Opens, two Wimbledons and one Australian Open), spend 160 consecutive weeks at No. 1 (1974-77) and rack up a record 109 career singles titles (John McEnroe and Roger Federer each have 77; Rafael Nadal has 58) is a testament, in large part, to a relentless and, at times, all-consuming will. This trait goes a long way toward explaining Connors’s most quietly astounding feat: for 16 years, he held a Top 10 ranking. In an era when tennis careers can flame out over a half-dozen seasons, Connors — who on his 39th birthday won a fourth-round U.S. Open match against the 24-year-old Aaron Krickstein in 4 hours 41 minutes — looks, in retrospect, more and more like a freak of nature or nurture or both."

Who Made That Picnic?,2013-08-23,article,News,,"['Picnics', 'Inventions and Patents']",The evolution of the movable feast.,"“It’s part of our DNA,” says Walter Levy, author of “The Picnic: A History,” who points out that “picniclike” events appear in the writings of Ovid, Plutarch and Seneca. The word “picnic,” however, is of more recent vintage. An early mention can be traced to a 1649 satirical French poem, which features the Frères Pique-nicques, known for visiting friends “armed with bottles and dishes.” In 1802, the term made a hop to Britain after a group of Francophiles in London formed a Pic-Nic Society to gorge, guzzle and perform amateur theatricals. Participants drew lots to determine who would supply which dish — from calf’s-foot jelly to blancmange. “Depending on your luck,” Levy says, “you might have to bring something expensive, like pie made from truffles.”"

I was totally lost by Page 2 of the preface — wondering what a Zilchbot was (12 dozen of them were attacking Captain Marvelous and his friends) and why I should care about Kid Caliber or the Diamond Dame (heroes trapped in the Nulzone). As for Captain Marvelous, he seemed like a vanilla remake — a rip-off, really — of Superman, from the big red “M” on his chest to his ruby red cape and captaincy of the Legion of Justice. I am an authority on the Man of Steel, having written a full-fledged biography of him. “I know Superman, Superman is a friend of mine,” I was tempted to write to the author, John David Anderson, “and Mr. Anderson, Captain Marvelous is no Superman!”"
Family Stories,2013-08-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Three picture books capture the objects and incidents that form a child’s heritage.,"What parent wasn’t thrilled to hear about the Emory University study suggesting that children who are told stories about their families’ pasts may develop a greater ability to cope with the vicissitudes of life? But most children’s books that convey a sense of family history and tradition — “All-of-a-Kind Family,” “Little House in the Big Woods” — are written with the older child in mind. Younger children are more likely to learn the day-to-day habits of rabbits, monkeys and bears. So it’s refreshing to find three new picture books that take as their subject the stories of human families, illuminating the ways certain rituals — along with sayings, jokes, pastimes and world views — get passed down through the generations."

In “What a Way to Start a New Year!” Jacqueline Jules imagines what Rosh Hashana might be like for a young family whose new year is starting in a new house in a new town. Dina, who is about 7, finds nothing is as it should be: the friends she liked to visit for the holiday are now hours away, and her home is a mess of packing boxes. “It doesn’t feel like Rosh Hashana here,” she complains. “We don’t even have a round challah.” A series of mishaps makes the phrase “What a way to start a new year!” a common refrain in the house, until a colleague of Dina’s father suggests the family join him at the temple he attends. Though the holidays are different than Dina remembers, she learns something about making friends and embracing change. Judy Stead’s illustrations, rich with festive pinks, greens and purples, are attractive and cheerful even when her characters’ expressive faces register disappointment or impatience. “What a Way to Start a New Year!” is notable in that Jules assumes a basic understanding of the holiday; making this amusing and less obviously didactic book a pleasure to read."

But in Berlin, with Hitler in the stands, Mr. Glickman and Sam Stoller — the only Jews on the relay team — were replaced the day before the event by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe, ostensibly because “secret” German runners were expected to challenge for the gold.

Coetzee’s richly symbolic early novels “Waiting for the Barbarians” and “Life and Times of Michael K,” his starkly narrated new novel plunges us at once into a mysterious and dreamlike terrain. But where those books evoke Coetzee’s native South Africa and the madness of apartheid, immersing the reader in situations of nearly unbearable intensity, “The Childhood of Jesus” is set in a possibly posthumous limbo in which a haze of forgetfulness has enervated most of the characters, as in a paralyzing smog. We arrive by boat in a city called Novilla, in an unnamed but possibly southern European country, in the company of a man named Simón, who has taken under his protection a child named David — “Not my grandson, not my son, but I am responsible for him.” It would appear that the travelers are refugees: they have come from a “camp,” a place called Belstar, where they were given Spanish lessons and two passbooks. The child has been separated from his parents. Simón seems to have no family at all. Having, like all his fellow travelers, been shorn of his memory on the voyage to Novilla, Simón arrives in unknown territory and must establish himself; he must find shelter and he must find work to support himself and the boy. If Simón has had a profession or a trade in his former life, he can’t recall it; he is grateful to find work as a stevedore, for which he is barely qualified. It will be Simón’s obsession to locate David’s mother, whose name he doesn’t know and of whom he knows nothing, not even whether she has arrived in this strange, nameless country."

Overcoming the Orthodoxy of Abstraction,2013-08-29,article,Review,,['Art'],A selection of Alex Katz’s work from the Whitney Museum of American Art is at the Nassau County Museum of Art.,"The standard narrative in 20th-century art history is that painters had to struggle against tradition and conservative institutions to forge a new language of abstraction.

The career of Alex Katz, who successfully made this transition, is one example.

It was like I was fighting off some very aggressive infection.” He wrote to his then-fiancée: “I’ll get over Pynchon somehow. Maybe through criticism, some discontinuity, some dialectic, that will enable me to forget him.” His future wife proved a stronger motivation than any dialectic.

Southern Discomfort,2013-08-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Wilton Barnhardt’s humorous novel concerns a family and a region coming apart.,"“Tell about the South,” his Harvard classmates beseech Quentin Compson in “Absalom, Absalom!” You’ll notice he doesn’t have to be asked twice. Sensitive Southerners — and Southern writers most of all — seem to love nothing better than explaining themselves and their region to outsiders (or to themselves, if no outsider is handy). There are exceptions, though, and Wilton Barnhardt would stand at the head of any list: though born and reared in the South, he has, over the last two decades, produced three well-regarded novels that almost never stray south of the Mason-Dixon line. There ought to be a prize for such forbearance. Or maybe he was just biding time, stockpiling ammunition. Because at long last he has tackled the South head on. Lacerating but affectionate, as exuberant as it is shrewd, “Lookaway, Lookaway” is a Southern novel so sure-footed the only real question for Barnhardt is, “What took you so long?”"
His Favorite Wife,2013-08-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A memoir looks back on the life of the fifth and final Mrs. Getty.,"I’ve often wondered what it takes to be the wife of a captain of industry. What combination of boundless optimism and self-delusion is necessary to live with someone whose real lover is his work, who cannot turn off his competitiveness when he walks through the door, whose wealth means his opportunities and temptations with women are somewhere between “a lot” and “infinite,” and whose children and wife exist as a beautiful backdrop to what he considers his real accomplishments?"

Would her lyricism camouflage or ennoble Haiti’s life-or-death struggles? But it quickly became apparent that her hypnotic prose was perfectly suited to its setting, the tragic and yet magical seaside town of Ville Rose."

Two (Sucked) Thumbs Up,2013-08-30,article,News,,"['Movies', 'Parenting']","For the self-identified cineaste, new parenthood doesn’t mean just seeing a lot fewer movies; it means no longer trusting your judgment about the rare movies you do get to see.","A year ago, on the day my wife, Liz, would give birth to our first child, we sat down to watch “The Avengers.” She’d already seen it, and it wasn’t something I was particularly dying to see — superhero movies aren’t usually my thing. My cinematic taste generally tends to the somewhat obscure and the challenging — I’d much rather rewatch anything by Rainer Werner Fassbinder than sit through any of the “Fast and Furious” sequels. But Liz had started to feel the fluttering of early labor, and our birth-class instructor had advised us that this particular stage could last for several hours. The best thing to do, she said, was find a distraction: go for a walk, play cards or watch a dumb movie. As it turned out, there wasn’t going to be a need for any distractions. Within minutes, that fluttering became what Liz described, with some understatement, as cramps. What followed was such an incredibly compressed labor that there’s actually a special name for it: precipitous labor, which happens less than 3 percent of the time. Our son, Jack, was born an hour and a half later, at home, in our bed. I still haven’t seen “The Avengers.”"
Googling Yourself Takes on a Whole New Meaning,2013-08-30,article,News,,['Wearable Computing'],The latest in high-tech eyewear.,"Here’s what you see if you look at my face: a skinny titanium headband stretched across my forehead. It looks like a futuristic pair of sunglasses, minus the lenses. On my right-hand side there’s a computer, a metal frame with a small, clear cube of plastic perched just over my eye. When I tilt my head upward a bit, or run my finger along the side of the frame, the cube lights up. What I see, floating six inches in front of me, is a pinkish, translucent computer screen. It gives me access to a few simple apps: Google search, text messaging, Twitter, a to-do list, some hourly news headlines from CNN (“See a Truck Go Airborne, Fly Over Median,” “Dolphin Deaths Alarm Biologists”). Beside the screen is a teensy camera built into the frame of the glasses, ready to record anything I’m looking at."

Barker of the rooms his father rented to test a radar system he was making for the U.S. military. John L. Barker Sr. — then an engineer at Automatic Signal Company — had been working on traffic lights in the 1930s, but during World War II, he dedicated himself to military research. “He pointed the machine out a window, and he tested it on cars that drove through an intersection.” Barker was about 8 years old at the time and admits that his memories are hazy. “I have no idea why I was even involved,” he says."

Alternate Realms,2013-08-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A story collection encompasses the mythic and the everyday.,"In Aimee Bender’s short stories, the value of life is measured in terms of goodness, succulence and simplicity, all qualities that can be tasted, chewed and ultimately swallowed by the mouth or the mind. In “Appleless” (one of this new book’s many parable-like fictions), the nameless narrator distrusts a girl who doesn’t appreciate the bright-hued, hand-clutched density and watery meat of apples — and the narrator goes on, with the help of others, to devour every last apple in sight. The overachieving seamstress of “Tiger Mending” isn’t satisfied with simply stitching up cut lips and handkerchiefs; she eventually takes a job in a faraway country sewing the stripes back on ruptured tigers (who apparently yawn too widely for their own good). And in one of Bender’s best stories, “The Red Ribbon,” a bored wife can’t enjoy sex with her husband unless he pays her. She likes to keep track of their accumulating ecstasies in a ledger: “ ‘I need a specific amount, each time,’ she said, ‘or,’ clearing her throat, ‘I feel I will melt into nothingness.’ ” "
Big Brother,2013-08-30,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A man attempts to reconcile with his estranged older sibling in this novel set in Toronto.,"Dennis Bock’s third novel, “Going Home Again,” begins ominously: “On the Friday evening before Kaj Adolfsson was killed, I was actually feeling pretty good about things.” But readers expecting Nordic noir will be disappointed. The murder, when we finally hear about it in the last few pages, is a minor plot point. This is not a whodunit but a story about reckoning with the past."
Free Range,2013-08-30,article,Review,,"['Poetry and Poets', 'Books and Literature']",A poet whose work inhabited a variety of subjects and forms.,"Major poets, like trick-or-treaters, tend to arrive in pairs or small groups (whether this is a matter of fate or academic convenience may be debated). And yet from roughly 1930 to 1950, British and Irish poetry seemed to fall under the sway of a single writer: W. H. Auden. Auden was hardly a solitary figure, of course — his compatriots included Louis MacNeice, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis (father of Daniel), and the four writers were once thought to be so intimately related that the poet Roy Campbell referred to them as “MacSpaunday.” But it wasn’t a relationship of equals: the MacSpaunday poets were usually considered notable not because of how closely they resembled one another, but because of how much the other three looked like Auden."
