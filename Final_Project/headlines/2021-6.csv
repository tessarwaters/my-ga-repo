It was a Black city. Following the Watts Rebellion — the uprisings that took place in August 1965 in the predominantly Black Watts neighborhood, just north of Compton in southern Los Angeles — white residents who hadn’t already left the area were desperate to get out. By the end of that decade, Compton’s population, which had previously been mostly white, was about 70 percent Black. “The difference between Compton in 1959 and in 1969 is almost like night and day,” says Robert Lee Johnson, a local historian. When the city elected Douglas Dollarhide, its first Black mayor, in 1969, he came into office with a majority Black school board and an entirely Black City Council. But keeping the city middle class was an uphill battle. The mass relocation of white-owned businesses led to sweeping job losses and soon Compton, which had formerly been “known for its housing and schools,” Johnson says, couldn’t afford to maintain either, let alone support the arts."

Hiding from the virus, in any case, was more reasonable than hiding from the ceiling or the refrigerator, as he would often suggest to me then, or from the Bible or Shakespeare’s complete works, as I would suggest to him. So we huddled under the table and screamed fake screams of fear — fake because they were whispered imitations of screams, and also because the fear was fake, in theory, though at that moment I did feel fear. Or maybe it was fatalism — a fatalism that now, in light of events, strikes me as a barely diminished version of optimism. "

"New Audiobooks From Seth Rogen, Danielle Henderson and Elon Green",2021-06-08,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"From a grisly ’90s true-crime story to slapstick comedy to family heartbreak, these narrators know how to keep your attention.","The only thing more essential to a road trip than an audiobook is gas. I often spend as much time selecting the listening material for a long drive as I do mapping the itinerary, and I’ve seldom made a better choice than LAST CALL: A TRUE STORY OF LOVE, LUST, AND MURDER IN QUEER NEW YORK (Macmillan Audio, 8 hours, 11 minutes), by Elon Green. Recently, my husband and I listened to this true-crime stunner on a drive from North Carolina to New York, and the hours flew by as quickly as the landscape. In 1991, a Pennsylvania Turnpike maintenance worker opened an unusually heavy trash bag and found a mutilated body: “It looked like a loaf of bread,” he recalls, “but then I saw freckles.” The freckles belonged to a gay man, a divorced banker and father who’d last been seen at a Midtown Manhattan piano bar called the Townhouse. Just over a year later, workers emptying trash cans at a rest stop in New Jersey found a bloody bag containing a human head. It belonged to a closeted gay man, a married father of four who had also last been seen at the Townhouse. These were the first known victims of the so-called Last Call Killer, who went on to murder at least two more gay men the next year. The nearly decade-long and sometimes bungled hunt for the serial murderer gives the book its suspense. Green’s sensitive portraits of the victims, and his deeply researched re-creation of an epoch of gay history, provide its soul. Inherently shocking material needs no dramatization, and David Pittu’s understated narration highlights the tragedy and horror of these crimes. “Last Call” is the kind of book that keeps you wide awake all night turning the pages. As an audiobook, it will keep you wide awake all day as you drive, hoping you don’t get wherever you’re going before it ends."

There is a proliferation of new sources, and one of them, E-Fish, is the outgrowth of a wholesale company that started selling fresh fish from various sources to restaurants last year. “Chefs had to deal with individual fishermen and it was complicated for them, but by aggregating we made it easier,” said Jeff Tedmori, the chief executive and a graduate of MIT’s Sloan School of Management. He came up with the idea with his business partner and the chief operating officer Matthew Henderson, whose family has been in the fish business for generations. Soon after they saw that the fishermen on their roster could not do enough business with so many restaurants closed, they opened for consumer sales. They say most of their products are harvested to order and shipped within a day. What is especially appealing for those of us in the East is that they carry some West Coast varieties that we rarely see, like succulent petrale sole, California king salmon and live spot prawns. Jean-Georges Vongerichten is on the company’s chef advisory board. "

"Brigid Berlin, Andy Warhol’s Most Enduring Friend",2021-06-18,article,News,,"['Art', 'Content Type: Personal Profile']","Berlin, who died last year, was a great artist in her own right, and her New York apartment, which is being sold, is a window into a bygone era in the city’s history.","In 2001, soon after he moved into the small prewar doorman building on East 28th Street where he still lives, Rob Vaczy met a 60-year-old Brigid Berlin as he was waiting for the elevator. His new neighbors had warned the multimedia producer about the nutty lady on the ninth floor — every building has one, they joked — with her querulous duo of pug dogs toted in a baby carriage, and nonstop pronouncements issued in an archaic highbrow accent straight out of “The Philadelphia Story.” Vaczy, then 36, was instantly enchanted. Growing up in a working-class Long Island family, he had been involved in the early 1980s punk scene and was familiar with Berlin’s lore of the Pop movement, though it took him a while to connect the dots, to figure out that the woman who lived four floors above him had starred in Andy Warhol’s films and was in his inner circle for more than 20 years. Vaczy knew her as the society girl manquée who got fat expressly to spite a controlling mother, and who earned the nickname Brigid Polk at the Factory, Warhol’s studio, because she loved to “poke” herself — and anyone in the vicinity — with a hypodermic needle of amphetamines. She had always scoffed at the idea that she was an artist, but friends like Robert Rauschenberg and the sculptor John Chamberlain regarded her as an equal. John Waters once described her as “big, often naked and ornery as hell.” That afternoon at the elevator she asked Vaczy if he wanted to come up to her apartment for five minutes. “But with Brigid, there was no five minutes,” he says. “We wound up drinking all night and watching ‘Dr. Zhivago.’”"

But can new directors really put the oil giant on a cleaner path?,"On the day the little investment firm Engine No. 1 would learn the outcome of its proxy battle at Exxon Mobil, its office in San Francisco still didn’t have furniture. Almost everyone had been working at home since the firm was started in spring 2020, so when the founder, Chris James, went into the office for a rare visit on May 26 this year to watch the results during Exxon Mobil’s annual shareholder meeting, he propped his computer up on a rented desk. As an activist investor, he had bought millions of dollars’ worth of shares in Exxon Mobil to put forward four nominees to the board. His candidates needed to finish in the top 12 of the 16 up for election, and he was nervous. Since December, James and the firm’s head of active engagement, Charlie Penner, had been making their case that America’s most iconic oil company needed new directors to help it thrive in an era of mounting climate urgency. In response, Exxon Mobil expanded its board to 12 directors from 10 and announced a $3 billion investment in a new initiative it called Low Carbon Solutions. James paced around the empty office and texted Penner: “I was doing bed karate this morning thinking about how promises made at gunpoint are rarely kept. Exxon only makes promises at gunpoint.”"

In 1980, about 5 percent of the country’s children between 2 and 19 were experiencing obesity, according to the C.D.C.; as of 2018, more than 19 percent were — and an additional 16 percent were considered overweight. Because children are far more likely to gain an unhealthful amount of weight while out of school over the summer, experts were worried last spring when in-person schooling was suspended indefinitely because of the pandemic. They feared extended closures might “exacerbate the epidemic of childhood obesity and increase disparities in obesity risk,” as researchers from the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and colleagues put it in a paper in the journal Obesity in June 2020. That, in turn, would mean more children living with related conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and fatty-liver disease. "
