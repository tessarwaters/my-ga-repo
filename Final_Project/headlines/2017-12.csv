Louise Erdrich on Pregnancy and Who Controls Women’s Bodies,2017-12-01,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"“When you’re pregnant,” Erdrich said recently, “everybody puts their hands on you.” Her new novel, “Future Home of the Living God,” hit the best-seller list last week.","EXPECTING: Louise Erdrich’s new novel, “Future Home of the Living God,” drops off the hardcover fiction list after debuting last week at No. 13. As a work of straight-up science fiction, imagining evolution out of whack and the climate in (more) acute crisis, the book represents something of a departure for Erdrich. But she’s cooking with familiar ingredients: Ojibwe identity, the Minnesota landscape and — especially — sexual politics, as the government asserts a claim on pregnant women’s bodies. “I wanted to explore what a public creature you become when you’re pregnant, how everybody puts their hands on you,” Erdrich told Bethanne Patrick in The Los Angeles Times last month. “You’re vulnerable to an extreme degree when you’re pregnant.” To that end, the novel grapples openly with questions of choice: not necessarily abortion, since Erdrich’s pregnant heroine wants her baby, but with women’s freedom to control their biological destiny. “It’s so obvious to me that anti-choice rhetoric isn’t about religious faith,” Erdrich told Patrick. “That’s just a way for people to frame what they’re doing in a way that is palatable for them. Anti-choice is about controlling women’s bodies period. It’s about seizing control of young women.”"

The book is, no surprise, every bit as rowdy as the movie. Haddish grew up in foster care in South Central Los Angeles, and for a time had a job as an “energy producer” at bar mitzvahs, where she was paid to dance enthusiastically and encourage other guests to have a good time. (“I was basically the Flava Flav of bar mitzvahs.”) In one memorable chapter, she explains how that gig led to a sideline pimping out her male friends. “If you’re doing bar mitzvahs, you’re going to meet old Jewish ladies,” she writes. “They started telling me how lonely they were and saying things like, ‘My husband’s not satisfying me.’” When one woman showed Haddish her collection of romance novels — “She had one that was like a slave thing or whatever. It was a big, strapping black guy on the cover, holding this passed-out white woman” — Haddish was inspired. “I don’t know any slaves,” she told the woman, “but I could probably hook you up with somebody big and strong.” Word spread, and Haddish thrived until the men realized they could cut their own deals without her. That’s O.K. She’s found other ways to put her people skills to lucrative use. On the copyright page, her publishers suggest stores file the book under “Biography and autobiography / Rich and famous.”"

It also happens to be the way detainees at Guantánamo Bay get their television. The satellite carries a wealth of religious programming, from “Bible Explorations” to “God’s Learning Channel” to “Global Buddhist Network” — not a lineup well tailored to the particular viewing interests of the Gitmo demographic. What detainees tend to be most interested in is current events, and among the news channels that the satellite carries, RT is one of the most popular. So for lawyers who want their Guantánamo clients to see that their interests are being represented, RT is probably the best option. For that reason, in 2014, a young defense lawyer named Alka Pradhan became a frequent guest on the channel. And because Pradhan is technically an employee of the Department of Defense, her appearances constitute one of countless idiosyncrasies of Gitmo: a contractor for the United States military using a Russian propaganda channel while working for Qaeda terror suspects."

How to Escape a Burning Building,2017-12-22,article,News,,['Fires and Firefighters'],Don’t stall in the “premovement phase.” Don’t hole up in a bathroom.,"“Don’t wait until you see smoke or flames,” says Margrethe Kobes, a senior researcher at the Institute for Safety in the Netherlands who studies how psychology and building design affect human behavior during fires. For one project, she offered subjects a stay in a four-star hotel. After conducting some sham experiments, everyone went to bed only to be awakened before dawn by a call from the front desk telling them the building was on fire. This, of course, was the real experiment. “In a fire, you need to evacuate quickly, but that’s not what we see,” Kobes says. Instead, people put on their shoes, got dressed, searched for their keys and repeatedly peered out their door into the hallway. Stalling before exiting is what evacuation researchers call the “premovement phase.” Don’t prolong it."

Poem: Ligament,2017-12-22,article,News,,['Poetry and Poets'],Selected by Terrance Hayes.,"Ever wonder about the role a sentence can play in a poem? It can be more controlled and malleable than a prose sentence. It can be a bit more subtle than a line break.

Harriet Tubman’s Hymnal,2017-12-22,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Words the Civil War abolitionist could not read, but still held sacred.","In 2010, a church hymnal that once belonged to Harriet Tubman — the American abolitionist hero who, after escaping slavery in 1849, devoted her new freedom to leading hundreds more of her fellow enslaved out of captivity, first as a conductor on the underground railroad and then later as a Union spy — was donated to the National Museum of African American History and Culture by the collector and historian Charles L. Blockson. Given to him by Tubman’s great-grandniece Mariline Wilkins (the daughter of Eva Stewart Northrup, whose signature is inscribed inside the book’s cover), it was just one of dozens of Tubman’s belongings bequeathed to the museum that day. Eric Williams, the curator of religion at the Smithsonian’s Center for the Study of African American Religious Life, considers the book particularly revelatory, given that Tubman was illiterate. “This idea of having a sacred book and not being able to read it,” he said in a phone interview, “that’s a window into her piety. And it is in line with a longer tradition one finds in the black religious experience in North America.” Although many black men and women, whether enslaved or free, could not read them, he explained, “these books — the Bible and hymnals — bore witness to the liberating power of the Gospel contained within their pages.” Williams told me that for Tubman, who could sing every word it contains, this hymnal would have been “invested with a spiritual power,” and that it is a text to be valued “not just as literature but as artifact — as an object of devotion.” "

Behind the Lens of ‘The Things They Loved’,2017-12-29,article,News,,"['Music', 'Photography']",The photographer explains how this year’s photo essay came together.,"I had heard of the “anniversary effect,” or the pain of a traumatic event returning as its calendar date comes back around. My father died on Dec. 16, 2016, so my own anniversary effect was in full swing when I began this project. At each door, I was met by a person who had stepped up when needed — who had recently lost someone but hadn’t yet finished taking care of them. After a while, I stopped being surprised by everyone’s sense of humor and warm, present, tense clarity of purpose: I related to it. It was the common denominator with everyone I met, probably because it is the prerequisite — or perhaps the reward — for being the person who steps up before and after a loss. Each circumstance was different, but my intention was to honor each absence by describing vitality and presence wherever I could find it."
