How to Keep Your Skin Moisturized for the Rest of Winter,2019-02-04,article,News,,"['Skin', 'Cosmetics and Toiletries']",Protecting your skin from the elements no longer means layering on uncomfortably thick salves.

It’s hard to overcome the season’s moisture-depleting elements — biting winds, extreme cold and overactive indoor heating systems — all of which can leave skin parched, she explains. But layering on thick creams is not necessarily the answer. “Unless they are formulated to absorb effectively into the skin’s lipid bi-layer,” Dr. Dolder says, “they will sit on the surface and potentially cause clogging of the pores.” This is especially problematic for sensitive and acne-prone skin types. Fortunately, a new batch of rich-but-not-thick moisturizers now delivers ultra-hydrating ingredients — everything from squalane to plant stem cells — with airy textures."

Cedric Vongerichten, 37, the son of the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, has opened a restaurant blending Asia and France, just as his father did. When it comes to Asia, the younger Mr. Vongerichten looks not to Thailand, but to Indonesia, the home country of his wife, Ochi Vongerichten, a partner in the venture. This is his first independent move; he is still the executive chef at the West Village restaurant Perry St., owned by his father’s company. So the name, Wayan, meaning “first-born” in Bali, is fitting. The front of the restaurant has a marble bar, whitewashed brick walls and a few tables. In a passageway to the main dining room in the rear is a shelf with a display of spices used in Indonesian cooking, like long pepper and turmeric root. There’s greenery throughout for a tropical feel, and the design, by Rockwell Group, includes custom Indonesian decorations. Mr. Vongerichten describes the food, most of it served family-style, as coming from a mixture of cultures, using French techniques to interpret Indonesian classics. There’s avocado and a peanut relish instead of spicy peanut sauce on his gado gado, and a rustic cabbage and egg dish; he is using less of the funky shrimp paste that is ubiquitous in Indonesia. Satays, small plates and bright, fruit-forward cocktails are on the menu, but no rijsttafel. (Opens Monday)"

Or perhaps it’s that our definition of eating well involves pizza slices picked up on the way to the movies and that our idea of exercise is slipping through the subway cars right before they close. But the past five years have seen a sea change in New York’s wellness culture. A new generation of plant-forward, Instagram-friendly cafes — among them Dimes and West-Bourne — are replacing funkier, hippyish staples like Souen in SoHo and Angelica Kitchen, which both closed in the past two years (though Souen’s East Village location remains open). And while the city has always had a thriving health and beauty scene, there has been a move toward the natural and holistic with shops like CAP Beauty and Clover Grocery, a wave of new healthful convenience stores and Taryn Toomey’s crystal-wielding workouts. Here, our list of the best New York has to offer — new and old — for those looking to get their wellness fix."

Today, travelers come to hike the misty trails linking Sapa to surrounding stopped-in-time villages such as Ta Phin and Cat Cat, whose residents sell handmade brocades and silver jewelry. For the new 249-key Hôtel de la Coupole, set in a mustard-yellow building in Sapa’s Muong Hoa Valley, the Bangkok-based architect and designer Bill Bensley was interested in how, a hundred years ago, these types of artisanal goods made their way to Paris and ended up influencing Western fashions. “I found a 1920s haute couture hat in Paris, which was basically a Vietnamese rattan hat covered in white and red polka dots, and decided to do the entire hotel like that,” he says. To that end, there are cane and velvet barrel chairs in the high-ceilinged cafe, Cacao Patisserie, and, in some of the bedrooms, French lounge chairs covered in graphic hill-tribe fabrics and linen-colored pendant lights draped in tribal silver beads. Bensley, who believes a hotel should be a layered, even intellectual adventure in itself, has also hung some 500 vintage fashion illustrations and ads throughout the property and erected a lobby installation lined with industrial-size bobbins spooled in jewel-toned threads that recall not just vibrant silks but also the lush orchid gardens of nearby Ham Rong Mountain. — LUCIE ALIG"

The designers had been thinking about domesticity, an idea that informed looks in pajama-like stripes and a shiny brocade reminiscent of ’80s-era curtains.

Can Bukowski’s view of addiction survive a new era?","It’s often thought that to become a poet, it helps to be a little gonzo. As the 16-year-old Arthur Rimbaud famously put it, “The Poet makes himself a seer by a long, gigantic and rational derangement of all the senses” — a description that, but for the careful inclusion of “rational,” makes poetry seem less a craft than an extreme lifestyle choice. As for Rimbaud it frequently was; his flailing misadventures with his lover Paul Verlaine are a case study in knives, bullets, profanity, theft and dubious personal hygiene. The idea behind this outré behavior was that “deranging the senses” doesn’t simply mean sitting at your desk having especially unusual thoughts; it means actively surrendering to your own unconscious and often unconventional desires. The poet’s sense of self becomes like a medieval tapestry obscuring a secret passage; it must be torn aside so that what waits in the darkness — monster or treasure — can be discovered."

36 Hours in Goa,2019-02-21,article,News,,['Travel and Vacations'],"Known for its gorgeous beaches and hippie vibe, this tiny state in western India also offers a fascinating blend of Indian and Portuguese influences that are reflected in its buildings, cuisine and art.","Think of it as India’s happy place: The state of Goa, which occupies a sliver on the country’s western coast, is where residents of Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and other cities converge for long weekends and lazy holidays filled with sun, sand and revelry. These days, the beguiling beaches might look like they’ve been colonized by foreign hippies and rave-goers by the thousands, but the region’s European connection dates back centuries. The Portuguese defeated the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur in 1510, beginning a four-and-a-half-century reign — Goa only became part of India in 1961, 14 years after the rest of the country won its independence from Britain. The result of this commingling of cultures is one of the most fascinating pockets of India, defined by a leisurely pace and laid-back attitude. Perhaps there’s no better way to describe the vibe in Goa than “susegaad,” a Konkani term derived from Portuguese that alludes to a sybaritic, contented way of life — or, as the travel show host and Goa resident Mayur Sharma told me, the feeling that you can “sink into life here.”"

In an age rife with the sleek and the minimal, papier-mâché (“chewed paper” in French), has less-than-mythic associations: It is homey and sloppy, redolent of kindergarten and the corner store. Like clay, papier-mâché is infinitely moldable, but instead of coming straight from the earth, a noble mix of raw minerals, it has lived another life entirely, from tree to pulp to industrial printing press to breakfast table to garbage bin to art, before emerging entirely unrecognizable in sculptural form."

Overproofed Gin for Your Martini,2019-02-25,article,News,,"['Gin (Liquor)', 'ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES']",Fords Gin Officers’ Reserve is a higher alcohol-content spirit made in the style of British Navy gin.,"Navy-strength describes a category of gin that’s overproof, that is, more than the standard 40 percent alcohol for most spirits (and sometimes more than 50 percent). “But why Navy?” you may ask as you sip your gin and tonic. In the British Navy, the shipboard gin supplies traditionally included casks, usually from sherry-making, that held high-proof gin reserved for officers. If gin (or rum) could ignite gunpowder, it gave “proof” that it was not diluted, and had to be at least 57 percent alcohol. Simon Ford, who makes Fords Gin, has now introduced his Officers’ Reserve, a Navy-strength gin at 54.5 percent alcohol. Like Fords Gin, it’s London-style, dry and infused with classic botanicals and spices, like juniper, which impart subtle flavor. The alcohol gives it heat, which can be tempered with ice and a splash of lime and good tonic water. It does well in a martini, with a little more than a soupçon of vermouth."

After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods.

In the summer, we hired two people for the same position. They had similar educational and work experience. One of the employees is a black woman living in a large city in Florida, and the other is a white woman living in a small city in the Midwest. When the employee in the Midwest was offered the position, the hiring manager did not consult the human-resources department and offered her a salary above the typical range. The employee in Florida was hired just a few days later and was offered a salary several thousands of dollars below what the Midwestern employee makes. The cost of living is significantly less in the part of the Midwest where the white employee lives, making the wage difference illogical. I am also furious that the nonprofit is paying a woman of color significantly less than a white woman, simply because of organizational politics."

On every morning (or at least some of them), the president has traditionally received the most crucial findings of the United States spying apparatus, personally delivered in a solemn face-to-face exchange with a senior intelligence official. Beginning in late 2016, a series of anonymously sourced reports claimed that Trump was not taking the brief with sufficient frequency, or seriousness, or focus, or preparation. Even after the inauguration, there were claims that the spies did not trust him and were holding the good stuff back; there were claims that Trump did not even believe in objective reality. In the middle of it was Pompeo, Trump’s new C.I.A. director, who some in the president’s circle felt was the man best suited to educate Trump about the complexities of foreign policy. The president “has a steep learning curve, but you’ve got to get him up it quickly,” Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s former senior adviser, says he told Pompeo."

The 180-seat, two-story space (with a wraparound gold-leafed Cubist-style mural on the ground floor and a grand polished walnut staircase leading to the second) will offer clams casino, oysters Rockefeller and cornflake-crusted crab cake served with coleslaw and spicy mayonnaise as well as classic mains such as roasted chicken for two, Dover sole in brown butter and parsley-topped strip steak. These dishes might be paired with an expertly mixed Rob Roy or Tom Collins and, for dessert, there’s spumoni and ice cream sundaes. “I’m not trying to invent anything,” says Keller. But he is trying to build a New York restaurant more approachable than Per Se, his celebrated fine-dining outfit farther uptown. “It used to be that you ate out to meet friends and to celebrate,” he says. “There was a real sense of fun.” To that end, TAK Room diners can look forward to live music and table-side preparations, which, Keller believes, aren’t about showing off technique so much as personality. — MAYUKH SEN"
