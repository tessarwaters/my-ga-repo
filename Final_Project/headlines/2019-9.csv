A dictatorial party facing domestic and global pressures — especially from the ongoing trade negotiations with the United States — the C.C.P. is getting impatient, apparently.

Watch with a grain of salt: In his review, the New York Times critic A.O.

What’s on TV Thursday: ‘The Front Runner’ and ‘The Emoji Movie’,2019-09-05,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",Movies airing Thursday night offer drama of both political and emoji varieties.,"THE FRONT RUNNER (2018) 5:20 p.m. on Starz. About a year after playing P.T. Barnum in “The Greatest Showman,” Hugh Jackman starred in this drama, which effectively posits that the former Senator Gary Hart’s 1987 presidential campaign was brought down by a media circus. Directed by Jason Reitman, the movie casts Jackman as Hart. It focuses on a period of weeks that begin with Hart being widely considered the most likely candidate for the Democratic nomination, and ends with the politician suspending his campaign after it is overcome by rumors of extramarital activities. The film “belongs to the accusatory tradition of ‘Ace in the Hole,’ ‘Network’ and ‘Absence of Malice,’ movies that see reporters and editors not as guardians of democracy but as barbarians inside the gates of the republic, subverting its values through cynicism, self-importance and mercenary scandal-mongering,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Reitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion,” he added. “But after a while, once we’ve met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play.”"

We all know what we ought to believe a man is, because every patriarchal culture (which is to say, most cultures) has taught us that to be a man is to possess variations of the same few key qualities, many of which arguably had more value in an age when physical might was actually necessary for human survival."

Certainly not the folks at Alfred A. Knopf, who published his first novel, “Go Tell It on the Mountain,” in 1953. Back then, the young James Baldwin — he was just 28 when “Mountain” came out — had a protector named William Cole, who was Knopf’s publicity director. Always on the lookout for fresh voices, the publicist read magazines like The New Leader, Commentary and The Nation, where, a few years earlier, essays and reviews by a man named James Baldwin had begun to appear with some frequency. And what Cole found in the emotionally charged writing were thoughts that sometimes — thrillingly — strained against its own gorgeous, literary, knowing style: Baldwin “read,” but from up high. Cole brought a few of his pieces to Knopf’s editor in chief, Harold Strauss, who contacted Baldwin’s agent and learned that he was at work on a novel."

What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and ‘WOW’,2019-09-07,article,News,,"['Movies', 'Television']",Women go head-to-head in the Oscar-nominated drama “Mary Queen of Scots” and in the women’s wresting show “WOW.”,"MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. A year after Saoirse Ronan played a pink-haired, rebellious teenager in the indie drama “Lady Bird,” she returned to the big screen as the title character of this period drama, Mary Stuart. Adapted from a biography by John Guy, the film reimagines the decades-long tug of war between Mary and another queen, her Protestant cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). When a young Mary returns to Scotland from France in 1561 and claims the throne, she asserts she also has the right to Elizabeth’s crown. That sets off a deadly rivalry between the monarchs, which is heightened by dubious men who manipulate their rulers only to inch closer to royalty. The movie opened to mixed reviews; some critics argued the performances were uneven and that Ronan dominates the picture. And while historians may find faults in the plot, the visuals place you right in 16th-century Britain. (The film received Oscar nominations for costume design and makeup and hairstyling.) THE FAVOURITE (2018), another historical drama about women scheming for royalty, leads in at 5:55 p.m."

Toggling between work and family life can be a challenge no matter your profession, but it’s especially trying for Ray Shoesmith, the contract killer at the center of this series.

In his review of that season for The New York Times, Mike Hale referred to the show as “another dark comedy about the divided soul of the 21st century male, caught between rage and cuddly vulnerability — in dramatic terms, between Scorsese and ‘Everybody Loves Raymond.’” The story, Hale added, “deftly and dryly exploits the gap between Ray’s violent occupation and his efforts to be a good father, boyfriend, brother, ex-husband and mentor.” Ray will continue straddling that gap in the second season, which debuts Thursday."

What’s on TV Friday: ‘Top Boy’ and ‘Undone’,2019-09-13,article,News,,['Television'],A British crime drama is revived on Netflix. And a surreal new series hits Amazon.,"TOP BOY Stream on Netflix. Over two seasons released toward the beginning of the decade, “Top Boy” established itself as a very English, very gritty example of modern crime drama. Set in the Hackney borough of London, the show counted among its ensemble a pair of rapper-actors (Kane Robinson, who performs as Kano, and Ashley Walters). They played Sully and Dushane, two drug dealers whose rise over the course of the two seasons led to rivalry. Their stories halted after the show’s network, Channel 4, canceled it. Five years later, it has been revived by Netflix — thanks in large part to the involvement of Drake, a fan of the show and an executive producer of its third season. The story resumes with Dushane (Walters) returning from exile in Jamaica to go into business with Sully (Robinson), who gets released from prison after a long sentence. Much of the drama centers on their conflict with Jamie (Micheal Ward), a young gang leader who has little interest in allowing the relative old-timers to resume business."

He based the faces on models from Sears catalogs and stock photos, but calls the type a “Redbook Juggler,” after the supermarket glossy that advises women on how to cook, shop and dress. While Currin’s exaggerated compositions blow his figures up to kewpie-doll proportions or deflate them into a jumble of jutting elbows and toothy smiles, he renders each inch of flesh in laborious, glowing brushwork that has earned him comparisons to Dutch masters. He was, in fact, exhibited alongside the celebrated Golden Age Dutch painter Cornelis van Haarlem, at the Frans Hals Museum in the Netherlands in 2011, just two decades after his first solo show at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in 1992 (where his provocative portraits of bold older women elicited accusations of sexism but nevertheless sold out). Currin’s works still draw that criticism on occasion, but not much that he depicts emerges solely from his own imagination. His subjects wash in from the flotsam of American life — kitschy souvenirs and cringey ads, screenshots and centerfolds — and it’s by polishing this lowbrow commerical imagery with a high-art sheen that he manages to make obvious what others might be happy to ignore about our culture.

Their pursuit of an assailant unexpectedly leads them back to Washington, where Marie, who’s been branded a liar, has lost faith in her own memory. Like other female-focused dramas like “The Sinner,” “The Tale” and “Share,” the series explores the ways in which memory and credibility are sometimes called into question in cases involving sexual assault and trauma."

It made sense, evolutionary psychologists theorized, that women’s erotic pleasure might be tempered by the potential burdens of pregnancy, birth and child rearing — that they would require a deeper emotional connection with a partner to feel turned on than men, whose primal urge is simply procreation. Modern statistics showing that men are still the dominant consumers of online porn seem to support this thinking, as does the fact that men are more prone to hypersexuality, whereas a lack of desire and anorgasmia are more prevalent in women. So it was somewhat surprising when a paper in the prestigious journal P.N.A.S. reported in July that what happens in the brains of female study subjects when they look at sexual imagery is pretty much the same as what happens in the brains of their male counterparts."

What Really Brought Down the Boeing 737 Max?,2019-09-18,article,News,,"['Aviation Accidents, Safety and Disasters', 'Boeing 737 Max Groundings and Safety Concerns (2019)', 'Pilots']",Malfunctions caused two deadly crashes. But an industry that puts unprepared pilots in the cockpit is just as guilty.,"On Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 taxied toward the runway at the main airport in Jakarta, Indonesia, carrying 189 people bound for Bangka Island, a short flight away. The airplane was the latest version of the Boeing 737, a gleaming new 737 Max that was delivered merely three months before. The captain was a 31-year-old Indian named Bhavye Suneja, who did his initial flight training at a small and now-defunct school in San Carlos, Calif., and opted for an entry-level job with Lion Air in 2011. Lion Air is an aggressive airline that dominates the rapidly expanding Indonesian market in low-cost air travel and is one of Boeing’s largest customers worldwide. It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots — most of them recent graduates of its own academy — and for paying them little and working them hard. Pilots like Suneja who come from the outside typically sign on in the hope of building hours and moving on to a better job. Lion Air gave him some simulator time and a uniform, put him into the co-pilot’s seat of a 737 and then made him a captain sooner than a more conventional airline would have. Nonetheless, by last Oct. 29, Suneja had accumulated 6,028 hours and 45 minutes of flight time, so he was no longer a neophyte. On the coming run, it would be his turn to do the flying."

What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Aniara’ and a Climate Forum,2019-09-19,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",A melancholic Swedish sci-fi movie hits Hulu. And several Democratic presidential candidates gather for a climate forum.,"ANIARA (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This sci-fi drama from the directors Pella Kagerman and Hugo Lilja is based on a downbeat 1956 poem by the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson. Like its source material, the movie tells a story that is, despite being about humans traveling beyond the confines of earth’s atmosphere, supremely claustrophobic: It centers on a spaceship knocked off course, out of fuel and running out of hope. The crew of the ship, which had left an earth in environmental ruin and was bound for a human colony on Mars, includes MR (Emelie Jonsson), the story’s protagonist, whose situation becomes increasingly grim. “At times, the commitment to bleakness feels artistically admirable,” Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The film unblinkingly faces the void, and it refuses to console the audience, which has come along for the ride. But mostly, this is a movie that simulates the experience of losing the will to live, a daunting premise even for the bravest voyagers.”"

But it was also the nursery for a new kind of moral activism.

"T Suggests: Photographs of ’70s California, a Family-Made Olive Oil, and More",2019-09-20,article,News,,"['Art', 'Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Sneakers']",A roundup of things our editors — and a few contributors — are excited about in a given week.,"Out this month — to accompany a show at the McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco — is a beautiful monograph of the work of the photographer Michael Jang. Born in 1951, Jang is Chinese-American, and grew up in Marysville, Calif., which is right outside Sacramento. From the start, he showed a natural affinity with the camera — his earliest pictures are of the Jang family in intimate moments: gathering at Christmas, watering the garden, doing the laundry. The pictures are playful, full of curiosity and laughter. Later, while attending school at Cal Arts, Jang found ways to rub shoulders with movie stars and politicians and other celebrities at the Beverly Hilton Hotel — he photographed figures such as Ronald Reagan, Jack Lemmon and David Bowie. Other moments, with crowds or bellhops, show how people and faces were fascinating for Jang. Afterward, he moved north to San Francisco, where he began to capture scenes on the street or out at night. It was the ’70s, and there’s something electric about seeing San Francisco through Jang’s eyes. I grew up in the Bay Area a decade and a half later, not too far from where Jang wandered around (and still does) — and though his pictures feel very familiar to me, that’s not why I find them so compelling. There’s something to admire in how technically precise Jang is in working in black and white — he seems to understand intuitively the depth of a picture before he even takes it, and I admire him more for how incredibly witty he can be, catching visual puns or simply revealing the humor of a particular moment: the college kid who has passed out sucking his thumb; the expression on the Sex Pistols’ Johnny Rotten’s face caught by surprise while lying low at Japantown’s Miyako Hotel. “Michael Jang’s California” is on view from Sept. 27, 2019 to Jan. 18, 2020 at McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco. The book “Who Is Michael Jang?” $65, is available now at atelier-editions.com. — THESSALY LA FORCE"

It’s an honest product not tricked up with caramel. Kitty Keller, an importer in Oakland, Calif., has some that are new to the American market, and they’re beauties. Copper-colored Mas d’en Gil, from Priorat, south of Barcelona, is more tart than sweet; use it to enliven a quick weeknight pan sauce for chicken or pork. Alvear from Cordoba in Andalusia makes both sweet and dry Pedro Ximenez vinegars; the complex dry one is my preference, especially for a vinaigrette."
