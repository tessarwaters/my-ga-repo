Escape From L.A.,2014-07-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In an apocalyptic future, a couple seek a stable community as they prepare for the birth of their baby.","Some dystopian novels, like Cormac ­McCarthy’s “The Road,” explore human relationships in dark, existential post-collapse scenarios, uninterested in either causes or solutions. Others engage with global warming head-on and imagine the possibilities beyond catastrophe, as in Margaret Atwood’s ultimately optimistic Madd­Addam trilogy. But there’s a middle path too — one exemplified by Edan Lepucki’s first novel, “California,” in which characters traverse a cross-section of mid-collapse landscape, framed by the gradual decline of civilization. This approach may seem too optimistic given dire news about melting icecaps and acidic oceans, but it does allow for a reading of the novel as satire, skewering the elements of modern life that have brought us to this tipping point.

Patriarch and Pariah,2014-07-03,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints)']","The life, and death by lynch mob, of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism.","A religion whose followers believe that the Earth was created somewhere in the neighborhood of the planet Kolob, and that the Garden of Eden was created somewhere in the neighborhood of Kansas City, Mo., would seem to have so fortified itself against mockery that there’s no sport in scorning it. In this respect, Mormonism is an honest reflection of its founder, a man who offers such an easy target that providing even a partial list of his myriad and exotic transgressions feels too easy, like a distasteful piling on.

Rural Noir,2014-07-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Tom Bouman’s “Dry Bones in the Valley,” an elderly recluse finds a stranger dead on his property in northeastern Pennsylvania.","Some stories are so sad, you want them to have the comfort of a gentle storytelling voice. Tom Bouman extends that kindness in DRY BONES IN THE VALLEY (Norton, $24.95), his beautifully written first novel set in the mountainous region of northeastern Pennsylvania that sits atop the Marcellus Shale, a vast geological treasure, prized and exploited for its natural gas resources. With neighbors feuding over whether to lease drilling rights to companies accused of poisoning the environment, it’s no wonder that a crazy old recluse like Aubrey Dunigan would be testy with anyone he finds hanging around his decrepit farm. But these hills are also overrun with meth cookers, dope dealers and Mexican drug cartels. So just because a stranger is found dead on his property doesn’t make poor old Aubrey a murderer."
A People’s History,2014-07-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"America’s true story lies with “its most overlooked and marginalized peoples,” this book argues.","“Where else in the world does one have the freedom to contradict oneself?” Ilan Stavans asks in “A Most Imperfect Union,” a witty alternative history of the United States from the arrival of European settlers to the shooting of Trayvon Martin and the Mars rover landing in 2012. It’s a prequel to “Latino USA” — his previous collaboration with the illustrator Lalo Alcaraz, a cartoon history of Latino culture in America — and even more ambitious. This time the focus is on “the dispossessed and minority groups of all stripes, as well as individuals known and unknown to most students of American history.” What the books have in common, Stavans writes, is “sarcasm.”"

Americanos,2014-07-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A group of Latino immigrants faces the challenges of assimilation in Cristina Henríquez’s novel.,"If it’s true that — in the long tradition of “Don Quixote” — all novels are about road trips, then perhaps no novels detail the challenges of the journey more than immigrants’ tales. The tradition is long and worldwide. The hearts of the downtrodden, the forgotten and neglected, swell with hope at the prospect of starting over somewhere. They collect their courage along with essential belongings and begin the trek to the unforeseen. No matter if the stories they’ve heard about the new country are exaggerated and acculturation is a frightening hurdle, it will — it must — be better than the present situation. In this spirit, the characters in ­Cristina Henríquez’s new novel, “The Book of Unknown Americans,” have come to the United States."

It is estimated that the country could get 450,000 laborers by the combing-out process. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 5, 1939."

Do I Have the Right to Be?,2014-07-05,article,News,,"['Philosophy', 'Time', 'War Crimes, Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity']",We fail to appreciate how radically contingent our lives really are.,"It’s a disturbing thought: All of us are alive today thanks at least partly to some mass atrocity that was committed in the past. This is because war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and ethnic cleansing invariably affect who is born after them. Who knows how many of us can claim, “Even if the Holocaust had not occurred, I would still have been born”? And if you can, perhaps because you were conceived before 1933 or shortly afterward without having been influenced in some way by the effects of Hitlerism, what about the Crusades or slavery in America? Anyone who reflects on the unjust death of others will be surprised at how much his or her own right to be is put in question, to the point where his or her place on this earth can appear as a usurpation. This might not be obvious at first so let’s slow down a bit. "

When “Justice” Isn’t Just,2014-07-05,article,News,,[],Readers comment on my column about an innocent man who spent 25 years in prison for murder,"My Sunday column looks at the flaws in our criminal justice system through the remarkable story of Michael Morton, author of a new memoir. Morton was a middle class guy in Austin with no criminal record, and he came home from work one day to find his wife murdered–and himself a key suspect. He spent the next 25 years in prison for murdering her, partly because the authorities suppressed exculpatory evidence. It’s as harrowing a story as you can imagine, and it’s a good starting point for a discussion about what to do to improve the justice system. Three elements of an improvement would be, I think: 1.) an end to the disastrous mass incarceration experiment that began in the 1970’s; 2.) an improved network of mental health services, so that prisons and jails are no longer our default mental health system; 3.) improved treatment programs for addicts, so that a failed war on drugs no longer fills up prisons and jails. That’s all a bit glib, I realize, and there’s no silver bullet solution the problems of drugs, but it’s impossible to read Morton’s memoir without feeling that the present system is an appalling and expensive mess."

1914: America Sends a Million Dollars of Gold to Mexico,2014-07-06,article,News,,"['Foreign Aid', 'Gold']",Highlights from the International Herald Tribune archives: Mexican rebels sponsored by money from the United States in 1914.,"EL PASO, Tex. — More than a million dollars of gold from big business sources in the eastern States alone have been poured into the Mexican rebel coffers during the last nine months. This is admitted by Constitutionalists of prominence. It is added that since the split between Generals Carranza and Villa much money has been withheld, and the rebel cause now faces serious embarrassment. The bitterness engendered by the clash of the two leaders has loosened tongues, and the facts are now known for the first time. The money has come here in single drafts for $50,000 at a time on two local banks transferring the funds. It is impossible to get documental proof, but it is believed that most of it has gone to the honest needs of warfare. So acute has become the need of more money that Senor Alberto Madero has hurried to New York to impress the capitalists alleged to be financing the revolution with the necessity of funds. General Villa is trying to raise money by concessions for the sale of dynamite and the exportation of cattle. The Pearson and Guggenheim lumbering and mining interests have been allowed to reopen. Unusual protection is being afforded the latter. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 7, 1914"

No More Anthony on ‘Opie & Anthony’,2014-07-06,article,Brief,,['Radio'],The radio shock jock Anthony Cumia has scratched off another of his nine lives.,"The radio shock jock Anthony Cumia has scratched off another of his nine lives: He was fired last week from SiriusXM’s “Opie & Anthony” radio show. The decision came after Mr. Cumia, below, posted what the company described in a news release as “racially charged and hate-filled remarks” on his personal Twitter account over a run-in with a black woman in Times Square. The tweets, as well as expletive-laced reactions toward his firing, have been removed from his account but can be found online. In the news release, Patrick Reilly, a SiriusXM spokesman, called Mr. Cumia’s comments “abhorrent” and “wholly inconsistent” with the company’s values. Fans have taken to social media to express support of Mr. Cumia, some saying they’ve canceled their SiriusXM subscriptions. An online petition to reinstate him had reached nearly 7,000 signatures through early Sunday afternoon. The show’s other host, Greg Hughes, a.k.a. Opie, posted on Twitter that he was devastated and would meet with SiriusXM on Tuesday. The hosts have a history of trouble. In 1998, Mr. Cumia and Mr. Hughes were fired from a Boston radio station for an April Fools’ prank in which they extensively, and falsely, reported that the city’s mayor had died in a traffic accident. In 2002, their syndicated show in New York was canceled after they broadcast a live account of a couple supposedly having sex in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. And in 2007, their XM Radio show was suspended for 30 days because of a bit about violent sex and Condoleezza Rice."

In her comprehensive takedown, the historian Deirdre N. McCloskey noted that Clark’s idea was a “bold hypothesis, and was bold when first articulated by social Darwinists such as Charles Davenport and Francis Galton in the century before last.” Indeed, over the past 150 years, various white Western scientists and writers have repeatedly offered biological explanations for Caucasian superiority. They have repeatedly failed because, as Mc­Closkey noted, none ever mounted a credible quantitative argument."

Zambia, with its abundant copper ore deposits, is one of the most important investment destinations for China. His English was excellent, and he liked to talk — and talk. After telling me about how much he loved the country and its people, he sometimes went into a rant about how Zambian miners liked drinking and money too much, and did not like to work hard. It was that mentality, he continued, that had caused his company all its troubles (not the workplace-safety and low-pay grievances of which it was accused). But even though the Zambian government had repossessed his company’s mines, this man wasn’t leaving. He was now working as an interpreter for the government. "

A dozen of his limpid gouache renderings of Michigan houses, all masterly compositions of point, line and plane, show buildings broken into constituent walls, roofs, floors and columns.

He brushed calligraphic proposals for the new streamlined building types of the Machine Age — gas and radio stations — with a fierce graphic energy. His radically angled photographs of America’s traffic jams, skyscrapers, fire escapes and power lines found their way into “Amerika,” the German architect Erich Mendelsohn’s photographic essay of American cityscapes.

This Disney 3-D animated movie musical produced “Let It Go,” the Oscar-winning power anthem, written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, on seemingly every child’s (and quite a few adults’) lips since its release in November. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee directed this fable about Elsa (the voice of Idina Menzel), an ice princess cursed with a frigid touch, and Anna (Kristen Bell), her younger sister and best friend. When Anna falls for a handsome prince (Santino Fontana), Elsa forbids them to marry, casting their Scandinavian kingdom into eternal winter with a wave of her hand. Horrified, she retreats to an ice palace atop a mountain, but sibling love sends Anna plowing through drifts and up glacial ridges in search of Elsa, confident that she can reverse the spell. “Allegorically, ‘Frozen’ lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this blockbuster, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.” “There are moments when you may feel that you are inside a giant crystal chandelier frosted with diamonds.” Josh Gad plays Olaf, the snowman sidekick (above, with Anna and Kristoff, voiced by Jonathan Groff) who would rather be a beach bunny, in this Oscar winner for best animated feature."

So far, the Obama administration, which has worked to maintain ties with the monarchy despite human rights concerns, has responded weakly. It must go further to show that such behavior is unacceptable.”"

By tomorrow evening, scores of competing “bals” will have sprung up at most of the major intersections and squares, and seemingly nearly all of Paris will be kicking high in a polka or weaving in a conga line. With a frenzy matching the revolutionary fervor in the streets on July 14, 1789, many will pursue the dancing until dawn on Tuesday. The hardiest then will rest briefly before hustling over to the Champs-Élysées for the annual military parade. Officially, July 14 has been celebrated as a national holiday only since 1880. The parliament then, it has been said, wanted to endow the Third Republic with a fête day comparable to those established under previous regimes. Although nearly a century had passed since the Revolution, strong but futile protests were delivered in parliament against the official glorification of a day associated with the parading of decapitated heads on spikes in the streets. Some of the rites marking that first official commemoration continue to be observed today. Others have been modified or have disappeared. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 13, 1964"

Never before had so many military planes of one country carried out an expedition of this character over the territory of another. The only information given the squadron commanders before they left the ground was that their destinations were “somewhere in France.” Sealed orders, when broken in the air, instructed the heavy bombers, totaling about eighty units, to make a round- trip, non-stop flight to Bordeaux, the French port on the Bay of Biscay, a two- way distance of nearly 1,200 miles. Similar orders provided a shorter flight for about forty medium bombers passing above the French cities of Le Treport, Orleans, and Le Mans, near Cherbourg.

Picture books about ­potty training, tantrum throwing, the death of a pet and other emotionally charged topics proliferated, and were often shelved together at the library under the catchall heading of “bibliotherapy.” Some authors explored these concerns more artfully than others. Judith Viorst (“Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day”) and the late Charlotte Zolotow (“The Hating Book,” “William’s Doll”) proved to be masters of the genre, their dry-eyed wit, empathic touch and storytelling prowess easily a match for their good intentions."

Adaptation,2014-07-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this first novel, a girl adopted from China finds it difficult to situate herself in American life.","At the heart of Kathryn Ma’s haunting first novel, “The Year She Left Us,” is a young woman who loses her way. Ari is 18 and home from a summer in China, where she worked for a company that takes Western families with adopted Chinese girls on “heritage tours.” They visit the orphanages and, sometimes, the places where the abandoned babies were first found: police stations, department stores and random patches of dirt by the side of the road. For these orphans, their “Finding Day” may be the closest approximation to the simple commonplace most of us take for granted — a birthday."
The Indiscreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,2014-07-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A holiday near the Mediterranean leads to disaster for a doctor and his celebrity patient in this novel by the author of “The Dinner.”,"Published in English last year, “The Dinner,” by the Dutch writer Herman Koch, became an international best seller in part by occupying that slender intersection between literary and commercial fiction. Its prose has the direct, undemanding quality of an airport novel, its story the momentum of a page turner. Yet its more literary devices — an elegant structure, with each section titled by course, “Aperitif,” “Appetizer” and so on, as a single restaurant dinner progresses; a narrator who seems increasingly unreliable — suggest a greater complexity, an ambition to achieve Higher Things."
School for a Scoundrel,2014-07-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A classicist tries to unravel the enigma of Seneca, the Stoic philosopher who tutored the emperor Nero.","The name Seneca brings a particular image to mind: a gaunt, half-naked old man, glaring wildly, his veins open, his lifeblood seeping into the small bath beneath him after he was forced to commit suicide. Painted by Rubens, memorialized by Dante in his first circle of hell, gilded into medieval manuscripts alongside Plato and Aristotle, Seneca has come to represent the perils of proximity to absolute power. The central question of James Romm’s “Dying Every Day” is this: When we confront this tragic Roman wordsmith, tutor to the emperor Nero (and, some argue, the power behind that terrible throne), who stares back at us? Is it a tyrannodidaskalos, a tyrant-teacher? Is he the ultimate exemplar of Stoicism, a would-be philosopher king? Or is Seneca simply an accretion of history, a phantom constructed to fit our ravening for heroes, for antiheroes and for the sensational in the stories of antiquity?"
Rage Runs Through It,2014-07-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A painter with violent impulses tries to start over, but his past catches up with him.","Jim Stegner — the narrator of Peter Heller’s second novel, “The Painter” — burns hot. When rage finds him, “everything goes dark at the edges. Kind of tunnels down to the target.” This temper drove him, years ago, to pull a .41 Magnum and shoot a known sex offender point blank. "
Inside the List,2014-07-11,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Joan Rivers’s “Diary of a Mad Diva,” No. 7 on the hardcover nonfiction list, is filled with the author’s brand of rapid-fire politically incorrect jokes.","The Fur Flies: Comedy is like sex, or subatomic particles: The more you try to analyze it, the more elusive it becomes. So it’s probably futile to look too closely at Joan Rivers’s latest book, “Diary of a Mad Diva,” new at No. 7 on the hardcover nonfiction list. But what the heck. As its title suggests, the book is structured as a conventional diary that happens to be filled with the author’s brand of rapid-fire politically incorrect jokes — in the second entry, Rivers contrasts herself favorably with Anne Frank: “I’ve written six books, and Anne? She didn’t even complete her one.” Rivers is unavoidably outré — racist, sexist, raunchy, crass — which isn’t to everybody’s taste. (Another way comedy resembles sex, and maybe subatomic particles — I’m no scientist — is that different folks like different strokes.) But readers seem divided as to whether Rivers is truly meanspirited or whether it’s all a provocation, a persona she slips into as easily as the fur coat she’s wearing on her book’s cover. When the CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield suggested as much in a recent interview, noting that Rivers is a well-known animal rights advocate and wondering whether the fur was there just for its shock value, Rivers went ballistic. “Are you wearing leather shoes? Then shut up,” she said, before storming off the set. “I don’t want to hear this nonsense.” She didn’t seem to be joking."

H. Brady.,"LITTLE SCHEIDEGG, Switzerland – The ascent of the Mönch made on Saturday by Mr. J. H. Brady, of Baltimore, was accomplished in face of the most unfavorable conditions, and the route chosen on the northern side of the peak was one of the most difficult. The progress of Mr. Brady and the two Grindelwald guides, Christian and Peter Kaufmann, who accompanied him, could be observed nearly all the time through glasses from the Seiler Hotel, at Little Scheidegg. The party took ten hours to reach the summit. The ascent of the Mönch peak, although its altitude is not quite as great as that of the Jungfrau, is one of the most difficult climbs in the Bernese Oberland. From Little Scheidegg, at the foot of the Eiger — which with the Mönch and the Jungfrau forms the Interlaken group of peaks, of which the Mönch is the central one — the journey requires at least thirteen hours, with a stop for rest and sleep at the Guggi Hut, where climbers for the Mönch and the Jungfrau part company. The Mönch was first scaled by Dr. Porges, of Vienna, in 1857. Its altitude is 13,465 feet, and the climb from the Guggi requires between nine and ten hours. It cannot be undertaken by anyone but a most experienced climber, as the difficulties to be overcome are innumerable. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 14, 1914"

The act provides for nullification by court order of revengeful wills in which husbands or wives cut off their widow or widowers and children with a contemptuous shilling or nothing at all, leaving them destitute while the money goes to charity, to persons outside the family or to some freakish cause. Testators are given self-defense, however, in a clause permitting them to append a side statement to their wills setting forth the reason for ignoring the dependants. The courts will take such a statement into consideration when dealing with a contested will. Those who may benefit under the act are limited to a widow or widower, unmarried daughters of any age, sons under twenty-one and sons or daughters who cannot earn their living because of mental or physical incapacity. If any such persons contest a will, a court will decide whether ‘‘reasonable provision’’ has been made. If not, the court may ‘‘tear up’’ the will and redistribute the assets of an estate. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 14, 1939"

What’s On TV Sunday,2014-07-13,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10:30 P.M. (Ovation) SERENITY (2005) A small crew aboard a spaceship led by Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) tries to scrape together a living smuggling cargo from one fringe of the universe to the next in this film written and directed by Joss Whedon. But the crew members’ off-the-radar existence is threatened when an agent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) of an oppressive government tracks them down, intent on killing a teenager aboard the ship (Summer Glau, above). Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis compared this science-fiction adventure with the “Star Wars” movies by George Lucas. “Scene for scene, ‘Serenity’ is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas’s recent screen entertainments,” she wrote. “Mr. Whedon isn’t aiming to conquer the pop-culture universe with a branded mythology; he just wants us to hitch a ride to a galaxy far, far away and have a good time.”"

The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that won successive elections after Mr. Mubarak’s fall, was swept from power during a military takeover of the government last year and banned as part of a crackdown on political opposition. Experts say a new election law is likely to further constrict Egypt’s political life, producing a legislature subservient to the new president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while reviving some of the patronage networks that thrived under Mr. Mubarak.

Introducing a Poet Who Works in 3-D,2014-07-15,article,News,,['Poetry and Poets'],"Alex Butler’s new verse volume, “Circling the Same” — which she’ll read from tonight at Creatures of Comfort — is a multimedia experience.","The writer Alex Butler may live in brownstone Brooklyn, but that’s about the extent of her similarities to the young literary set. A licensed social worker, she has also worked for the designer Jane Mayle, served as a production assistant on the set of “Sex and the City” and recorded a series of humorous performance videos. It was the loss, in quick succession, of both her parents — and Butler’s experience as her mother’s caretaker during a harrowing illness — that spurred her to turn what had been a secret hobby into a career. But rather than sit down at a laptop and type about the experience, she began speaking words and dialogue into a Dictaphone — and later her computer’s camera — which led to not one, but two books: her debut memoir, “Walking the Night Road,” due out next year from Columbia University Press, and “Circling the Same,” a 41-poem meditation on loss. The latter — newly available online through its publisher, the Los Angeles–based gallery and art-book press Ohwow — is as much art object as literature: Butler’s words are printed alongside photographs from the artists Mirabelle Marden and Andrea Longacre-White. “Both of these artists’ work, and what I imagined were their intentions, reminded me of a world altered by grief,” she explains."

Somehow it’s all very funny.","Maria Bamford has a mantra of sorts, and here it is: Do the work. Three words, three syllables. An easy, orderly thing. She tells it to herself when she wakes up in the morning, whether it’s at her bungalow in a middle-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Los Angeles or at a Holiday Inn in Boston or a Marriott in Bloomington, or any of the other highway-side hotels she hits for one night before moving on. Do the work. It’s a stay against paralysis, against the descent of dread. It’s less dramatic than “seize the day!” more affirming than “stop overthinking everything!” It is functional, and that’s what she’s trying to be. Do the work. She repeats it on airplanes, in taxis, on the long walks she takes to calm her nerves before a show. Sometimes she amends it to: Just do the work, the “just” a reminder that she’s not, after all, performing surgery on babies. There’s another, more refined version, too. Do your bits, she’ll tell herself, resigned to the idea that this may always be a struggle. Just do your bits."

O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called “a brilliantly truthful movie on a subject that is usually shrouded in wishful thinking, mythmongering and outright denial.” Robin Williams portrays Dwight D. Eisenhower; Liev Schreiber is Lyndon B. Johnson; and Alan Rickman is Ronald Reagan, with Jane Fonda as his wife, Nancy; Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz are the fellow butlers who become Cecil’s close friends; and David Oyelowo is the older son whose politics Cecil eschews. “In part, their story is a chronicle of the generational misunderstanding that has occurred in upwardly mobile families of every background, especially in the baby boom era, when educated and restless young people turned against the parents who had sacrificed so much on their behalf,” Mr. Scott wrote. “ ‘The Butler’ has the historical insight and the generosity of spirit to honor the father and the son equally, and to look with skepticism at each’s point of view.” He added: “We remember those who marched and who stood up for themselves in the face of injustice. It is good to remember that, to paraphrase Milton, they also stand who only wait and serve.”"

A semiofficial communiqué issued in Warsaw read: ‘‘Quite apart from the manner in which Germany may desire to incorporate Danzig in the Reich, Polish political quarters declare that the very fact of such an incorporation would constitute an inadmissible violation of the present political and juridical state of affairs and would evoke the appropriate response.’’ This response, if previous Polish declarations are to be trusted, would be in the form of the use of force by Warsaw to restore the status quo ante in the Free City. In a declaration in the House of Commons at the beginning of last week Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made it clear that should Warsaw determine to resist an attempted change from within or without in the status of Danzig, Britain, backed by France, would come to its aid. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 19, 1939"

Back in the ’20s, Scotch was a synonym for “cheap.” Richard Drew, a 23-year-old research assistant at Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, was trying to create a sticky-but-not-too-sticky adhesive tape for auto painters to use on two-tone paint jobs. When he erred on the not-too-sticky side, one of the car-painters asked, “Why so Scotch with the adhesive?” and a brand name was born."

The shooting coincided with racial outbursts in other Southern cities, including St. Augustine, Fla., and Philadelphia, Miss. Police said five white men who entered Mr. Crosby’s drive-in restaurant were arrested and charged with assault in a scuffle that preceded the shooting. The victim of the shooting was identified as Maurice Lawson of Atlanta. Mr. Crosby was arrested and charged with wounding Mr. Lawson. He was released on $1,500 bond. Detective Tony Quave said Mr. Lawson and the five told the Negroes in the restaurant, “You just have to go.” Mr. Quave said the white men attacked two of the Negroes, punching one in the nose, before Mr. Crosby pulled his pistol. Mr. Crosby held his fire and ordered the white men to leave. All left except Mr. Lawson, who advanced on the restaurant owner with a beer bottle. Mr. Crosby then began shooting. A few blocks from Mr. Crosby’s restaurant, a white man and his son were wounded by blasts from a shotgun fired by Negroes from a passing car. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 19, 1964"

Since so many of the criticisms of the reformist tendency have focused on issues where there either isn’t a definite “reform” position or where our ideas are more modest and incremental than the received wisdom about what American conservatism “must” do, I’m concerned that my responses — whether on immigration, foreign policy, the culture war, or climate change — have contributed to the sense that reform conservatism somehow has an ambition problem … that it’s a plausible first step toward a new right-of-center agenda, but lacks (or hasn’t yet been gutsy enough to advance) the Big Ideas that conservatism really needs to matter in American policy debates again.

So is 13 a lucky number for Siddons? Maybe not, judging from the largely disappointed comments readers are posting online about “The Girls of August.” But Siddons has overcome negative reviews before. As a student at Auburn University in the late 1950s, she was fired from the campus newspaper for defying the administration with a scorching column in support of integration (an incident that later found its way into her novel “Heartbreak Hotel”). “Never write a column when you’re mad or sick or disgusted, or all three,” she proclaimed early in the offending essay. “These are the things that make bad little columnists get reprimanding letters from the intelligentsia. Only the greenest, foolhardiest, most naïve amateur would broach a forbidden subject in Enemy Territory. . . . Meet an amateur par excellence.” Later in the same column she mulled the word “tolerance” — “It’s a grown-up word. Children and mobs do much better with four-letter ones” — and criticized people who were content to let their “moral petticoats” drag in the “good old Southern mud.” Auburn finally did integrate in 1964, seven years after that column, and the school eventually forgave Siddons for her justified dudgeon. It awarded her an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 1997, and organized a tribute to her last fall on the anniversary of the column’s publication date."
Stop the Clocks,2014-07-18,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],David Grossman’s book in verse is an intimate study of grief and mourning.,"The emblematic Man, any man, every man — dazed, heartsick, utterly bewildered — suddenly pushes away his dinner and gets up from the kitchen table. He can’t take it any longer — the overwhelming, claustrophobic grief, which has hollowed him out — and so he decides to go “there.” But where is there? That’s what the emblematic Woman, any woman, every woman, can’t figure out. That’s what she wants to know. She understands, this woman who is also a mother, a wife, that there is no place to go when you’ve lost a child. You are already wounded by disaster, forever bereft. “In an instant we were cast out / to a land of exile,” she remembers. But this man can’t sit still any longer. The trouble has taken him over again. And so he sets out to go “there” anyway. It has been five years, and he is determined to see his dead son one more time, though no one has ever made the journey and come back alive.

It has to do with the nature of the genre. Furst’s makeshift spies act with courage, but their choices are shaded with a brutal irony, darkened by what we readers, a few paces further along in history, know will be coming for them and the people they care about: the battlefields, the camps. The consolation Furst offers for this knowledge is present in a careful hedonism, which insists on the heightened beauty of the evanescent during wartime — the unexpected pleasure of a meal or a glass of wine, a night in bed with a stranger as it snows outside, anything human."

A ’70s Childhood,2014-07-18,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets']",Dan Chiasson’s new collection evokes the father he never knew.,"In his fourth book of poems, “Bicentennial,” Dan Chiasson is after beauty of a kind, so his poems are often beautiful, odd and quite moving.

Yet “Bicentennial” is no mere intellectual pleasure. It’s also a journey into a 1970s New England childhood haunted by a father Chiasson never knew."

Bush. “Yes, it is a probing and unsettling inquiry into the recent political and military history of the United States, but it is also a bracing and invigorating philosophical skirmish,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The tension between those two registers — between hard facts about state violence and devilish abstractions about causes and consequences — is what gives the film some of its energy and suspense.” The film, he added, “is a cat-and-mouse game in which each player thinks he’s the cat, making it both thrilling and disconcerting to watch.

The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office, in a statement carried by the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency, said the officers had fabricated an investigation into a supposed terrorist group as a pretense to spy on top officials. More than 500 prominent figures have been illegally wiretapped since 2010, CNN Turk television reported, citing the prosecutors’ office. More than 100 officers have been charged with falsifying evidence, illegal wiretapping and espionage, and 67 were taken into custody in a 22-city security operation. Some of those who were detained were involved in a corruption inquiry that ensnared Mr. Erdogan’s close circle and forced four ministers to resign in December, news reports said.

A report by the World Health Organization and Unicef said that 36 children had been paralyzed by the polio virus in Syria since the disease first reappeared there last October after a 14-year absence. Polio also has been detected in two Iraqi children in Baghdad, and it paralyzed one of them in April, the report said. Although 25 million children under the age of 5 have been vaccinated multiple times in seven Middle East countries under an emergency campaign, the report said many Syrian children missed out because of fighting and restrictions on distributing medical aid. The report said 765,000 Syrian children under 5 live in hard-to-reach areas. Polio, which is spread by feces, was thought to be nearly eradicated a few years ago, but it has spread in some fragile countries this year. In May, the W.H.O. declared a global health emergency because of the resurgence, imposing travel restrictions on Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon because the virus had spread from those countries to neighbors.

The ruling, which The Board calls “mindless and harmful,” seized on “poorly drafted” language in the Affordable Care Act to end subsidies in the states that opted not to set up a state health exchange and instead relied on the federal exchange. “It defies common sense to think that Congress really intended that there be no subsidies at all in 36 states,” The Board writes. For now, the outcome is unclear: A second federal appeals court panel ruled the opposite way just a few hours later and the Obama administration is expected to appeal the first decision. “Consumers are expected to retain their coverage and tax credits while this and similar suits in other jurisdictions wend their way through the court system.” In future decisions, The Board calls for “common sense in interpreting the law, not ideological opposition to Obamacare.”"

1914: Servian Nation to Resist Austria,2014-07-25,article,News,,['World War I (1914-18)'],Highlights from the International Herald Tribune archives: A correspondent appraised Serbia’s chances in a war with Austria-Hungary in 1914.,"BELGRADE — Servia will not shrink from the power of the great Austro-Hungarian Empire, and will reply to force by force. It is a possible case of David and Goliath. Such is the opinion I have gathered here on every side. It may sound at first suicidal on the part of this small country to seek to measure itself against the might of the Dual Monarchy. But the Servians don’t seem to have an atom of fear. Undoubtedly — and the opinion of all military experts who have seen them is the same — the officers and men of the Servian army constitute the best fighting material in Europe. I saw them, at the time of the first Balkan war — three divisions, or 60,000 men, march through Mustapha  Pasha, to the aid of the Bulgarians. Every man had already been in one, two or more actions. Everything one hears and sees leaves the impression that the Servians know what they are about, and that their lack of fear concerning their traditional enemies, the Austrians and Hungarians, is not without good reason. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 26, 1914"

I read it in restaurants, on the subway and in the park. I read it with the front cover obscured. To dislike the title of the book is to reject its putative premise — that Brando wasn’t just a sexy slob with no technique but an extremely skilled, deeply intelligent, fiercely perceptive “public citizen” who “carefully controlled his smiles.” Mizruchi seems to be making a case that the modus operandi of one of the movies’ greatest performers can be reduced to the strategic concealment of dental work.

Inside the List,2014-07-25,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Marja Mills, whose “Mockingbird Next Door” is No. 4 on the hardcover nonfiction list, spent ample time observing Harper Lee going about her ordinary daily life.","Private Lives: America’s most famous literary recluses are back in the spotlight. J. D. Salinger, who died in 2010, is the subject of Thomas Beller’s gentle New York-centric biography, “J. D. Salinger: The Escape Artist,” while Harper Lee turns up at the center of “The Mockingbird Next Door,” by the former Chicago Tribune reporter Marja Mills, new at No. 4 on the hardcover nonfiction list. There are a lot of superficial similarities between Salinger and Lee: Born seven years apart, both wrote beloved novels that have endured for decades as staples of high school reading lists — “The Catcher in the Rye” and “To Kill a Mockingbird,” as if you didn’t know — and both quit writing in the early 1960s to retreat into strictly enforced silences. But they probably never met for drinks, to judge from the portrait of Lee that emerges in “The Mockingbird Next Door.” Mills first met Lee and her sister on assignment for The Tribune, and eventually rented the house neighboring theirs in Monroeville, Ala., for a year and a half, during which she had ample time to observe Lee going about her ordinary daily life: eating at McDonald’s, feeding the town ducks, fishing with hot dogs as bait. Contrast those humble details with what we’ve learned over the years about the deeply eccentric Salinger, whose daughter claimed he sat in an orgone box and drank his own urine, and it becomes clear they don’t have much in common after all."

Liberal people may not have been universally admired, but few took to castigating them as dangerous to the health of the state. The opposite of “liberal” was not “conservative” but “strict.” When Bassanio tells Portia in “The Merchant of Venice” that he will give her “the dearest ring in Venice,” she replies, “I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.” No one in Shakespeare’s audience would have concluded that the dissolute nobleman with whom she banters stood on the left side of the political spectrum."
Against Closure,2014-07-25,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],This novel’s protagonist cannot surmount his grief over his wife’s murder.,"A while ago, on the planet of the novelists, two warring factions argued over whether or not characters had to be likable. Absolutely not, the frowny-face contingent claimed, arguing that one of literature’s goals is to illuminate the state of being human, in all its flawed glory. The smiley-face tribe took umbrage: What’s the matter with creating characters readers would like to have as friends? But maybe the question of liking or not liking is the easy one. The harder one, maybe, is what should we make of characters who never really allow us to know them? Characters who are in pain for reasons we understand and behave badly for reasons we can comprehend, but who inspire nothing as strong as liking or loathing.

Love Is Strange,2014-07-25,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Cruelty and lust predominate in A. L. Kennedy’s stories.,"My inappropriate nickname for A. L. Kennedy is “Dr. Strangelove.” Not because she’s a devious former Nazi played by Peter Sellers in a movie of the same name, but because her work is obsessed with love and strangeness and, in this particular case, with the strangeness of love. There’s also a strangeness in her writing — both her premises and her sentences — that makes it tricky to situate this prolific Scottish author in any particular literary context. She does things her fellow widely prized and widely translated peers do not: compose whole novels in the second person, write BBC dramas, perform stand-up comedy and ponder in prose the existence of such items as a chocolate-flavored condom, as she does in her new collection of stories, “All the Rage.”"
World of Our Great-Grandfathers,2014-07-25,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Jews and Judaism']",A history of Jewish life in the villages of Eastern Europe before the period familiar to American Jews.,"Back in the days when Jews could travel without having to go anywhere — one minute a house was in Poland, the next in Russia — they lived in places called shtetls, defined neither by physical size nor population, possessing mysterious features both urban and rural. Though Christians lived there too, the shtetl tilted spiritually toward Jerusalem, while performing economic services for the Slavic society to which it also belonged, giving it an Eastern European character all its own. Its amorphous nature has made it the subject of easy mythologizing, so that it often pops up in the American imagination as a kind of Jewish Brigadoon where all the villagers are singing, unless they are running from a pogrom."
Insatiable Gaze,2014-07-25,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Art']",A biography of the painter who crossed paths with everyone from Kate Moss to the Kray brothers.,"Was Lucian Freud really a great painter? I’m not convinced. But he looms large in the social history of postwar London, an inimitable figure who crossed paths with everyone from Kate Moss to the Kray brothers. Born in Berlin in 1922, Freud was 10 when his family moved to London (well before his famous grandfather, who escaped Austria only in 1938). He showed precocious talent as a draftsman — and as a troublemaker. Quick with his fists, he was a chronic expellee. Eventually he ended up at a private art school in Essex run by Cedric Morris; when the school burned down one night, Freud took the credit. But he remained a protégé of Morris, one of a series of gay elders with whom the young Freud knew how to ingratiate himself — though he was conspicuously, not to say voraciously, heterosexual. His looks were as striking as his talent, despite Stephen Spender’s observation at the time that he resembled Harpo Marx."

Written from 1910 to 1920, before Harding was elected president, the correspondence has helped inspire reassessments of his time in office. Harding is usually relegated to the bottom of presidential rankings. But he shouldn’t be, according to Vox’s Dylan Matthews and Slate’s Ronald and Allis Radosh. “Harding was hardly a great president,” Matthews writes, “but he doesn’t deserve the overwhelmingly negative reputation he’s developed.”"

In the wake of several storms that have engulfed his life, he’s been left stranded, a fish flapping uselessly on the sand. Set, as so many of Winton’s books are, in Western Australia — “which was, you could say, like Texas. Only it was big” — his new novel, ­“Eyrie,” is a dark but dazzling study of people and places on the edge. These marginal zones are where Winton enjoys spending time, scavenging for driftwood, floats, rope, old sea boots — and characters like Tom Keely, a washed-up environmentalist who’s been unceremoniously ejected from the world of idealism and activism."

But the champions aren’t safe yet: this new round of games pits past winners against one another in an ultimate death match. Donald Sutherland returns as President Snow, the target in Katniss’s sights; Liam Hemsworth is one of her love interests, Gale Hawthorne; Woody Harrelson is Haymitch Abernathy, the only living Hunger Games victor from District 12; and Elizabeth Banks is Effie Trinket, the tributes’ escort. “ ‘Catching Fire’ isn’t a great work of art but it’s a competent, at times exciting movie and it does something that better, more artistically notable movies often fail to do: It speaks to its moment in time,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Boys (and men) are still boys, of course, including in movies, but the very existence of Katniss — who fights her own battles, and kisses and leaves the boys, only sometimes to save them — suggests cultural consumers are ready for change, even if most cultural producers remain foolishly stuck in the past.

In particular, it’s been interesting to watch Ryan’s liberal critics train so much fire at his blueprint’s support (not as a universal requirement, as I understand it, but as a potential model for states to follow) for a contractual approach to anti-poverty spending, in which beneficiaries draw up customized life plans, set goals and targets, and have rewards and penalties pegged to their follow-through on those responsibilities. The liberal critiques of this idea, from writers like Annie Lowrey and Jamelle Bouie among many others, have been genuinely informative: I feel (sincerely!) like I have a better handle on the left-of-center view of poverty and anti-poverty policy than I did a week ago, and hopefully my future posts on the subject will profit from that advance in understanding."

Out there the waves would be less than a foot high, perfect conditions for our prey. “Those specks really like clear water,” said Bob Walter, a 58-year-old fishing guide everyone calls Captain Walt. My father, Bill Neville, stood next to him near the skiff’s center console as we motored downstream, the wake fracturing the sunlight into golden tesserae. The captain had been doing this for 43 years, and my father, who is in his 70s, has pretty much spent his entire life within whiffing distance of the bay. For as long as I can remember he has been chasing speckled trout."

Immortal Beloved,2014-07-31,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Classical Music']",This biography of Beethoven is also a personal journey through his music and the Enlightenment-era ferment that shaped it.,"In the show “30 Rock,” there was a running joke about tragedy. A character appears, reveals her tearful past, then brightly adds, “They made a Lifetime movie about me” — the credential of an absurdly pathetic story with a redemptive payoff. Of all the great composers’ lives, Ludwig van Beethoven’s seems the most made for Lifetime. The curtain opens on a difficult childhood: an abusive alcoholic father, a boy genius mocked for his dark skin. He survives, makes his way to Vienna for fame and fortune — only to be stricken by (gasp) deafness. In addition, we have impossible passions for mysterious beloveds, side themes of class struggle, freedom, individuality, the backdrop of Napoleonic conquest and a score (what a score!) surging with alternating storminess and tenderness. Beethoven’s story is almost too good to be true, and almost too bad to be television. "
Mr. Salinger’s Neighborhood,2014-07-31,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Writing and Writers']",Thomas Beller views J. D. Salinger as a New York writer.,"“J. D. Salinger: The Escape Artist,” by Thomas Beller, is a story of echoes. In this short, sensitive and irresistible biography, echoes ricochet from Salinger to Beller and back, bouncing off a word, a phrase, an accent, a memory, a chat with an acquaintance. Beller grew up in Salinger’s far-reaching shadow, that cool, shady place so many kids have discovered in “The Catcher in the Rye”: the overwhelming relief of shared anxiety. He also grew up in New York. The sidewalks, the gravel paths of Central Park, the elevators and white-tiled bathrooms that figure so prominently in Salinger’s work are part of Beller’s vocabulary, too. He writes about New York in both his fiction and nonfiction with intimacy and patience and wonder. New York City is a unifying theme in “J. D. Salinger,” almost as much as Salinger’s life itself, almost as much as Salinger’s work. It is in New York, the fictional, literary city and the actual city, where the two writers truly meet."

A period that yielded the blandest of modern presidents, Gerald Ford — “a Ford, not a Lincoln,” as he circumspectly described himself — is not to be confused with cataclysmic eras like the Civil War, the Great Depression and the Vietnam ‘60s. The major mid-70s disruptions — the Watergate hearings and Richard Nixon’s abdication, Roe v. Wade, the frantic American evacuation of Saigon, stagflation, the dawn of the “energy crisis” (then a newly minted term) — were adulterated with a steady stream of manufactured crises and cheesy cultural phenomena. Americans suffered through the threat of killer bees, “Deep Throat,” the Symbionese Liberation Army, a national meat boycott, “The Exorcist,” Moonies and the punishing self-help racket est, to which a hustler named Werner Erhard (né Jack Rosenberg) attracted followers as diverse as the Yippie Jerry Rubin and the Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

In “Calvary,” he plays a world- and time-tested expert of another sort: Father James, a conscientious priest and widower whose faith isn’t shared by his flock, which includes a serial sinner, a hostile Buddhist, a dog hater and other furious souls, including one self-professed future executioner."

Countries can’t either, at least not over the long run. But countries can certainly leave the bill for their current spending to the young and to future generations. Official borrowing is the old-fashioned way to do this: Sell Treasury bonds, and other securities, and spend the proceeds. But borrowing in broad daylight has a drawback: The more you do it, the more lenders worry about repayment, and the more interest they charge for their loans."
