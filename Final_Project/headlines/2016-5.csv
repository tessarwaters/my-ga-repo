And a new exhibition at Pace Gallery presents “The Yosemite Suite,” a group of more than 20 works that Hockney made on his iPad during visits to Northern California’s Yosemite National Park in 2010 and 2011."
Duro Olowu and Sidney Garber’s Striking Jewelry Collaboration,2016-05-02,article,News,,['Jewels and Jewelry'],The dressmaker and the jeweler’s new capsule collection features lightweight lapis and gleaming gold.,"It didn’t take long for Brooke Garber Neidich, the daughter of the legendary Chicago jeweler Sidney Garber, to make a name for herself after she began to design jewelry for her father’s eponymous boutique. Her versatile, just-conceptual-enough pieces — in particular, her signature chain bracelet, a stretchy length of articulated gold — made fast fans of powerful women like the Olsen twins. When her father died, she inherited the business, and in 2014 she opened a second shop in New York. Now, she’s expanding her horizons further by introducing a collaboration with the Nigerian-born clothing designer Duro Olowu. To hear the pair tell it, the idea was hatched casually over dinner and carried out almost effortlessly; indeed, the resulting capsule collection is an easy, seamless blend of two aesthetics: Upper East Side meets citizen of the world. “We really have the same taste,” says Olowu, whose drapey printed dresses have their own passionate fan base. They agreed that lapis — a relatively humble, deceptively lightweight blue stone that Olowu describes as luminous and seasonless — should anchor the collection, which includes a chunky ring, sinuous lariats and a bold, studded cuff, all set in gleaming gold and available at Neidich’s Madison Avenue store."

Now the duo has collaborated with Burrow bakery’s Ayako Kurokawa on a scented and flavored cookie, as part of Régime des Fleurs’s ongoing Artefact program of collaborations. “We used essences that can be used for both perfumery and flavoring,” says Woods. “It’s meant to be tasty but subtle — and hard to put your finger on.” The dough and icing are subtly infused with notes of bergamot, orange, elderflower and almond to conjure up the uplifting feelings Kurokawa’s hand-painted watercolor-like bouquets represents. Each cookie is made to order in Brooklyn, and takes about a day and a half to complete."

The recognizable geometric shapes, stringent symmetry and acceptable flora established in French gardens had remained unchallenged for centuries; Burle Marx abandoned the rigid layouts and began to use local plants. Importantly, he treated these projects as a form of art. “The flowers and the plants were his brushes and his colors, and the landscape became the canvas,” says Jens Hoffmann, the deputy director of exhibitions and public programs at the Jewish Museum. “And there was an added dimension of time. He became very, very sophisticated in his understanding of the way that things grow, when, under what conditions — and he could influence these conditions, too, by planting things next to one another, or he sometimes created shadows so certain plants weren’t exposed to light.”"

Some ingredients, including pork and eggs, come from his upstate farm. (Opens Friday): 60 Greenwich Avenue (Perry Street), 212-373-8900, tapestryrestaurant.com."

On the far wall, a smudgy Cy Twombly canvas hangs above a row of ceramics. The unglazed vessels look very Edmund de Waal, but in fact are the creation of Rogers’s mother-in-law, Dada, who first taught her to cook. “Edmund de Waal admired them when he came to dinner,” says Rogers of the ceramicist’s handiwork, as she scales a ladder to reach a vertiginous kitchen cupboard. The whisk she procures proves essential in the day’s delicious agenda: the preparation of white and green asparagus served with a sparkly take on a traditional Bagna Cauda (meaning “hot bath”) sauce. Here, the red wine that typically makes up this centuries-old northern Italian recipe, featuring garlic and anchovies, is swapped for Prosecco (the full recipe for which is detailed below)."

No one is doing that more hilariously than Brad Williams, who gets his second Showtime comedy special on Friday, May 20.

Step 2: Wait.” In the new special, “Daddy Issues,” he serves up a rollicking story about running a race in the Special Olympics and chastises the men in the audience over which urinal not to use in a public bathroom.

You have to ask yourself one question: Who do you want your kid to be? Do you want your kid to be ready for the world that is, or for the world that should be?”"

Directed by Zhang Yang, it dramatizes a 1,200-mile pilgrimage by the actual residents of the Tibetan village of Nyima. The movie so upends the traditions of documentary and narrative filmmaking that “dramatizes” may be inaccurate — the filmmakers followed the real pilgrims for a full year, after all.

Soi Cheang, a former assistant to the likes of the Hong Kong auteurs Ringo Lam and Johnnie To, honors this tradition with the generically titled policier “Kill Zone 2,” a quasi-sequel to a 2005 Donnie Yen vehicle and a hearty, layered, big-budget helping of orchestrated mayhem."

I refrained from starting that sentence with “It is a truth universally acknowledged,” because it isn’t, and also because that would have been too obvious a way of calling attention to the Austen glut and its attendant clichés. I’m happy to report, in any case, that the release of “Love & Friendship” mitigates both the shortage and the surfeit. It’s the Whit Stillman movie that some of us have been waiting a long time for, and also a Jane Austen movie that goes some way toward correcting the record of dull and dutiful cinematic Janeism."

DeLillo is well known for his attention to the music and even the visual appearance of his sentences: “The words typed on the white page have a sculptural quality,” he told The Paris Review in 1993. But to judge from his interview with The Los Angeles Times, this devotion to craft doesn’t extend to shoptalk with writer friends. “When I talk to novelists, we tend to talk about movies,” he said. “It’s true. It’s much easier to talk about. I just don’t talk much about my work with other writers, and I don’t talk much about their work. A few sentences. We’re like two characters in an old western movie in which the main element, the main audio element is to be very laconic. That’s what happens when I talk about writing with other writers.”"

Over the past 100 years, regular injections of inert, unthreatening forms of feminism were supposed to stave off the virus threatening to wreck a patriarchal body politic. Now that women’s liberation is cool again, now that the f-word is cropping up on billboards, catwalks and talk shows, the pressing question is how far radical feminists can allow the mainstream to co-opt our movement without cheapening the message. Andi Zeisler’s “We Were Feminists Once” is a shrewd survey of, as the subtitle has it, “the buying and selling of a political movement.”"

The peculiar intimacy of modern audiobook narration (with earbuds, the narrator’s voice seems to emanate from inside the listener’s head) intensifies the old association with cozying up with Mom or Dad and a bedtime book.

Le Nain Brothers’ Prescient Work at Kimbell Art Museum,2016-05-19,article,News,,['Art'],"“The Brothers Le Nain: Painters of Seventeenth-Century France” illuminates one of the greatest, least-known sources of modern realism.","One of the least-known sources of modern realism will be honored Sunday, May 22, in Fort Worth, where the Kimbell Art Museum is opening “The Brothers Le Nain: Painters of Seventeenth-Century France.” Contemporaries of Velazquez and Georges de La Tour, the brothers — Antoine, Louis and Mathieu — were prominent in Paris in the 1630s and 1640s. Often signing their efforts simply Le Nain, they elevated genre painting with dignified depictions of peasants usually seated, motionless, in landscapes or plain interiors. Odd in scale, spatial illusion and gravity of mood, these images are fittingly painted in a solid, workmanlike style and are startlingly prescient of 19th-century French artists like Courbet and Manet. Collective anonymity has always seemed appropriate to the way the Le Nain brought painting down to earth, but this rare overview of 44 paintings — including less radical religious works — also presents new scholarship regarding which brother did what.

Inside the List,2016-05-20,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Louise Erdrich, whose novel “LaRose” is No. 8 on the hardcover fiction list, says getting humor into her work is “the hardest thing.”","Tragicomedy Central: If you were compiling a list of America’s funniest novelists, you might not think to include Louise Erdrich. That’s no knock against her: Erdrich’s richly layered books, dealing with subjects from rape to war to marital strife to racism, have rightly placed her in the top ranks of the literary pantheon. They just haven’t earned her a reputation for, you know, humor. So it’s striking that reviewers of her latest novel, “LaRose” — new at No. 8 on the hardcover fiction list — have singled out what Mary Gordon, in these pages, described as “this serious novel’s unexpected comedy.” (Gordon cited a scene in which the residents of an assisted-living home tamper with a villain’s medicine to give him “an unstoppable erection and uncontrollable diarrhea.” This in a book about the shooting death of a 5-year-old boy.) In a profile for Erdrich’s hometown newspaper, The Minneapolis Star Tribune, the journalist Laurie Hertzel also praised the story’s comic elements. “Oh, good,” Erdrich said. “I was looking over my notebook a while back, and I had this giant note in the middle of my pages. And it said: ‘Problem. Big problem. There is no humor whatsoever in this manuscript.’ It’s the hardest thing, writing humor into a book. But it’s also essential. I just don’t feel like I’ve got a book unless there’s something funny in it.”"

‘Jane Doe January’ and ‘I Will Find You’,2016-05-24,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Two women write books piecing together decades-old sexual attacks.,"Like a common virus, the experience of rape invades not only the body but the mind of its victims, and it can do so in startlingly similar ways. Dissociation kicks in, mercifully and efficiently, almost like a response of the immune system, as well as a twisted, desperate desire on the part of the victim to please the rapist, in the desperate hope of a quicker conclusion, a better chance for survival. And yet, while these reactions appear to be almost universal, their emotional wake is intensely personal, possessing — at times obsessing — each individual in a unique way. Consider, for example, these two memoirs, which explore the 20-year aftermath of being raped by a stranger."

On Reading ‘Portrait of the Artist’ as a Young Man,2016-05-25,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"For years, I thought literature belonged only to others. James Joyce taught me I was wrong.","This year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.” Its genesis was long and tortuous — Joyce began writing his novel in 1904 — and the road to its canonisation as one of the seminal works of Western literature was not short either: The reviews spoke of the author’s “cloacal obsession” and “the slime of foul sewers,” comments that seem strange today, insofar as it is the subjective aspect of the book, the struggle that goes on inside the mind of its young protagonist, that perhaps stands out to us now as its most striking feature. What appeared at the time to be unprecedented about the novel seems more mundane to us today, whereas what then came across as mundane now seems unprecedented. Joyce’s novel remains vital, in contrast to almost all other novels published in 1916, because he forcefully strived toward an idiosyncratic form of expression, a language intrinsic to the story he wanted to tell, about the young protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, and his formative years in Dublin, in which uniqueness was the very point and the question of what constitutes the individual was the issue posed."

As an adult, I don’t subscribe to any religion. My immediate family, however, continues to be deeply religious and very much adheres to what I now believe are extreme views. They are, of course, free to worship as they please. I, however, take issue with the hypocrisy in their own lives. For example, they are strongly anti-choice, yet one had an abortion during a complicated pregnancy. They are “pro-family,” yet gave up an adopted child that became “too difficult.” They boycotted a parental wedding because the bride and groom were each previously married; participating would have “blessed the sin.” There is also a personal aspect for me in that they openly oppose L.G.B.T. rights, support politicians and groups that are extremely anti-gay, attend schools that require opposition to gay civil liberties in their codes of conduct and belong to anti-gay churches. I’m openly gay. I have been told that I am not welcome in certain family members’ homes because of my “lifestyle choice.” "

The Story Behind the E.P.A’s Contaminated Water Revelation,2016-05-27,article,News,,"['Hazardous and Toxic Substances', 'Teflon', 'Regulation and Deregulation of Industry']","Fifteen years after one environmental lawyer called for better regulation of perfluorooctanoic acid, the agency has finally responded.","Last week 5.2 million Americans learned that their drinking water is contaminated with man-made chemicals linked to cancer. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a health advisory for two compounds: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is used in the manufacture of Teflon and other nonstick substances, and the related perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). An E.P.A. health advisory is not a regulation; it is nonbinding and nonenforceable. It does, however, require a public water system to notify its customers of the presence of the chemical and the dangers it poses. As a result, the E.P.A.’s announcement had immediate effects. Within hours, public wells were shut down in Horsham, Pa., and Maricopa County, Ariz. West Virginia’s Bureau for Public Health ordered a “do not drink” advisory for the water in three communities: Parkersburg, the site of a Teflon factory that until recently was operated by DuPont; the adjacent town of Vienna; and Martinsburg, four hours east, near the Maryland border. The West Virginia National Guard sent convoys of tankers containing drinking water to Vienna."
