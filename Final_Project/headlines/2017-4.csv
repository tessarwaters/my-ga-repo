A slow-roasted pork sandwich, a wild rice grain bowl and a maitake mushroom tart are some lunch items. Dinner will feature brined vegetables, scallop crudo, roasted red cabbage, and pork collar with sprouted spelt and endives. Bowls of steel-cut oats are served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

A French-born jihadi named Larossi Abballa had murdered a police officer and his wife in a town west of Paris and then delivered a macabre speech on Facebook Live — with the couple’s 3-year-old child cowering nearby — in which he called for the killing of seven public figures. The French media omitted the details, but an Interior Ministry official soon called with confirmation: Kepel’s name was near the top of the list. His initial feeling, he later told me, was “as if the subject I’ve been studying for 35 years had turned around to strike at me.” Within hours, he had a government security team assigned to guard him 24 hours a day. A similar death warrant was issued against him later that summer, elevating the sense of danger."

The “degenerate art” was presented in chaos and disarray, accompanied by derogatory labels, graffiti and catalog entries describing “the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or pencil.” Hitler and those close to him strictly controlled how artists lived and worked in Nazi Germany, because they understood that art could play a key role in the rise or fall of their dictatorship and the realization of their vision for Germany’s future."

One Photographer Spent 25 Years Documenting Wealth,2017-04-07,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Photography']",Lauren Greenfield‘s “Generation Wealth” documents the lives of the affluent in America.,"Lauren Greenfield (who may be most well known for her 2012 documentary “The Queen of Versailles”) has been documenting American wealth since 1992, when she began taking pictures of students at her old high school in Santa Monica. “Despite the dramatic divisions in the city revealed by the L.A. riots ... rich kids and poor kids had found common ground that their parents had not, and it was a shared love for Versace,” she writes in “Generation Wealth,” her new book. With a golden cover and 650-odd images inside, the volume is a sociological record of the extreme measures taken to acquire and spend money, what Greenfield calls “the influence of affluence.” One shot shows Tupac at the craps table in Vegas, another, a Chinese billionaire’s replica of the White House. Some of the photographs will go on view this weekend in a show of Greenfield’s work at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, and are set to land in New York this fall, around the release of her next documentary. All of this output suggests a longstanding clarity of purpose, but Greenfield says it wasn’t until the financial crisis of 2008 (which she calls “a morality tale”) that she realized the underlying theme uniting her work. “It’s not about Birkin bags or the Kardashians,” she says. “It’s about the culture that gave rise to them.”"

The metaphors we use to talk about brains and minds struck Daugman as especially susceptible. The technology that Greeks and Romans developed for pumping water, for instance, underpinned their theories of the four humors and the pneumatic soul. Later, during the Enlightenment, clockwork mechanisms left their imprint on materialist arguments that man was only a sophisticated machine. And as of 1990, it was concepts from computing that explained us to ourselves: “Today’s embrace of the computational metaphor in the cognitive and neural sciences is so widespread and automatic that it begins to appear less like an innovative leap than like a bandwagon phenomenon,” he wrote. “There is a tendency to rephrase every assertion about mind or brains in computational terms.”"

The Unreasonable Genius of Russell Westbrook,2017-04-13,article,News,,['Basketball'],The end of the N.B.A. season proved that the Oklahoma City Thunder player is a maniac of historic proportions.,"The N.B.A.’s regular season ended last night, which means that we can now say it officially: Russell Westbrook is not just an unreasonable maniac — he is an unreasonable maniac of historic proportions.

This had happened only once in N.B.A. history, in 1962, and it seemed unlikely to ever happen again. “Averaging a triple-double,” I wrote, “is like having a helicopter that is also a boat that can also write the Great American Novel”; if Westbrook managed to pull it off, it “would be not only historic and impressive but also a little weird, almost disturbing.”"

Auden published a very long poem that, despite winning a Pulitzer Prize, is now remembered less for its contents than for its title: “The Age of Anxiety.” Something about the idea that an age can be anxious must resonate deep in America’s cultural bones, because the phrase has been used to describe countless moments since, from the vogue for tranquilizers like Miltown and Valium in the ’50s and ’60s to the coronation of today’s young adults as, in The New York Post’s recent estimation, “The Anxious Generation.” At this point, it’s difficult to imagine a slice of time whose resident humans would not agree with the notion that their lives were more hectically modern — more anxiety-inducing, more in need of the occasional benzo — than any before."

One week later, it sued a ring of law firms, accusing them of illegally levying high fees on desperate clients seeking to lessen their crushing debt loads. In the days that followed, the government took action against several others, including a California-based mortgage lender and a Virginia-based pawnbroker.

"New Sentences: From ‘Barkskins,’ by Annie Proulx",2017-04-18,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],Rarely is a writer quite so good at making words’ sounds match their meanings.,"Annie Proulx’s “Barkskins” is — and I’m simplifying slightly here — a 700-page intergenerational soap opera about lumberjacks.

Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.,"For the past few years, the Harvard professor David Keith has been sketching this vision: Ten Gulfstream jets, outfitted with special engines that allow them to fly safely around the stratosphere at an altitude of 70,000 feet, take off from a runway near the Equator. Their cargo includes thousands of pounds of a chemical compound — liquid sulfur, let’s suppose — that can be sprayed as a gas from the aircraft. It is not a one-time event; the flights take place throughout the year, dispersing a load that amounts to 25,000 tons. If things go right, the gas converts to an aerosol of particles that remain aloft and scatter sunlight for two years. The payoff? A slowing of the earth’s warming — for as long as the Gulfstream flights continue."

Our Climate Future Is Actually Our Climate Present,2017-04-19,article,News,,"['Global Warming', 'Floods']","How do we live with the fact that the world we knew is going and, in some cases, already gone?","A few years ago, a locally famous blogger in San Francisco, known as Burrito Justice, created an exquisitely disorienting map, with help from a cartographer named Brian Stokle, and started selling copies of it online. The map imagined the city in the year 2072, after 60 years of rapid sea-level rise totaling 200 feet. At present, San Francisco is a roughly square-shaped, peninsular city. But on the map, it is severed clean from the mainland and shaved into a long, fat smudge. The shape of the land resembles a sea bird diving underwater for prey, with odd bays chewing into the coastlines and, farther out, a sprawl of bulging and wispy islands that used to be hills. If you lived in San Francisco, it was a map of where you already were and, simultaneously, where you worried you might be heading. “The San Francisco Archipelago,” Burrito Justice called it — a formerly coherent city in shards."
How a Warming Planet Drives Human Migration,2017-04-19,article,News,,"['Global Warming', 'Politics and Government', 'Middle East and Africa Migrant Crisis', 'Sustainable Living', 'Migrants (Environmental)']",Climate displacement is becoming one of the world’s most powerful — and destabilizing — geopolitical forces.,"Climate change is not equally felt across the globe, and neither are its longer term consequences. This map overlays human turmoil — represented here by United Nations data on nearly 64 million “persons of concern,” whose numbers have tripled since 2005 — with climate turmoil, represented by data from NASA’s Common Sense Climate Index. The correlation is striking. Climate change is a threat multiplier: It contributes to economic and political instability and also worsens the effects. It propels sudden-onset disasters like floods and storms and slow-onset disasters like drought and desertification; those disasters contribute to failed crops, famine and overcrowded urban centers; those crises inflame political unrest and worsen the impacts of war, which leads to even more displacement. There is no internationally recognized legal definition for “environmental migrants” or “climate refugees,” so there is no formal reckoning of how many have left their homes because climate change has made their lives or livelihoods untenable. In a 2010 Gallup World Poll, though, about 12 percent of respondents — representing a total of 500 million adults — said severe environmental problems would require them to move within the next five years."

To get there, you ride an industrial elevator more than 325 feet into the earth, and that brings you to the operations tunnel, a curving space as lofty as a cathedral. It is so long that workers get around on bicycles. Safety goggles mist up with the heat and the humidity; the rock walls, wet from dripping water, look so soft they might have been scooped out of chocolate ice cream. This is as far as anyone — even the workers — can go. The caverns themselves are an additional 100 feet beneath the ocean: two sealed cylindrical vaults, extending away from Jurong. They opened for business in 2014. Next year, three new vaults will be ready. Then, if all goes according to plan, there will be six more."

"Rei Kawakubo, Interpreter of Dreams",2017-04-26,article,News,,"['Fashion and Apparel', 'Photography']",The 74-year-old force behind the avant-garde label Comme des Garçons makes otherworldly clothes that express hidden desires and fears.,"Rei Kawakubo is a 74-year-old Japanese designer who has been making monochromatic, boiled, overstuffed, unraveling, surreal clothes since she began her label, Comme des Garçons, in 1969. In the ’80s, an era of triangular fluorescent shoulders and moussed bangs, she sent widow’s weeds trailing down the runway. In the ’90s, her clothes grew tumors that resembled bustles, blurring the lines between illness and beauty, what to look at and what to look away from. While her stores stock simple cotton poplin shirts as well as more challenging lumpen jackets and her runway shows present one-off sculptures, the through-line is a thoughtful rejection of should and a strong feeling of perhaps. The name of her label, which translates to “Like the Boys,” is a quiet, defiant shrug."

Is that why so many activists distrust him?,"Last May, at the height of the Democratic presidential campaign, two weeks before the California primary, Bernie Sanders flew to San Bernardino, Calif., for a meeting with leading AIDS groups. The gathering was arranged by Peter Staley, the esteemed activist and founder of the Treatment Action Group, which in the 1990s helped speed the development of antiretroviral drugs. The meeting was called to secure the Sanders campaign’s support for a spike in federal spending to combat AIDS, but as the session began, those in attendance were puzzled to find the conversation oddly strained. Sanders’s demeanor, Staley recalled, “was very wary — he was very chilly when we shook hands.” Sanders seemed to be churning internally about something until, dispensing with ceremony, he blurted out: “Let me be blunt. Do any of you get money from the drug companies?”"

The Man to Blame for Our Culture of Fame,2017-04-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"His name was Walter Winchell, and he presided over Table 50 of the Stork Club, temple of a new cult of celebrity, in mid-20th-century Manhattan.","It’s gone now, replaced by a small, unobtrusive park, but in the middle of the 20th century the Stork Club, on East 53rd Street in Midtown Manhattan, was the center of an emerging national culture of celebrity. As Daniel J. Boorstin wrote in his landmark 1961 book THE IMAGE: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, fame, which had once been based largely on achievement or on high birth, was becoming more a matter of “a person who is known for his well-knownness.” And the Stork Club was the temple of the high priest of this new cult of fame for fame’s sake, the columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell, who presided over a mélange of stars, athletes, politicians and the merely notable from the club’s Table 50. In Winchell’s reporting, “The death of ten thousand people in Ethiopia was followed immediately by a Hollywood divorce or romance,” Neal Gabler wrote in his brilliant 1994 biography WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity. “Dozens of these items raced past listeners each program, not only abutting one another but most given the same urgency and drama. Nothing was differentiated.” Winchell’s reach was enormous. One listener recalled “strolling one Sabbath evening for six blocks through a residential section of Birmingham [Alabama] and never losing a word of W.W.’s broadcast as his voice came through a succession of open windows.”"

It’s never been less fragile, and with this MoMA survey, which opens on Sunday, April 30, one of its most astute critics becomes one of the season’s brightest stars. (Through July 30; moma.org.)"

But really these are just the parsley on the meatloaf. Flip through the back pages and it’s clear that Warren, the hard-punching Massachusetts senator, has a more personal fight in mind: The index listing for “Trump, Donald” is divided into dozens of subcategories beginning with “bait-and-switch and” (two citations), then moving on to “bigotry and” (four citations), “corporate influences on” (five citations) and “trickle-down and” (seven citations). There are also listings for “tax returns and,” “‘nasty woman’ comment of” and — my favorite — “tweetstorms vs.,” which directs readers to a four-page recap of Warren’s social media battle with Trump during the presidential race. “I tweeted about how he cheated hardworking people who had built his hotels and golf courses,” she recalls. “I mentioned his bullying, his attacks on women, his racism, his obvious narcissism. And in that first tweetstorm, I did my best to sound the alarm: This guy is dangerous, and he could end up as president of the United States.”"

7 Key Themes in Rei Kawakubo’s Career,2017-04-28,article,News,,['Fashion and Apparel'],"In advance of the Comme des Garçons designer's exhibition at the Costume Institute, Alexander Fury revisits important ideas in her work. ","In the 1980s, the color black quickly became synonymous with Kawakubo’s aesthetic. When Comme des Garçons made its Paris Fashion Week debut in 1981, the clothes drew attention in their absolute absence of color — an impression that was underlined by interviews with Kawakubo, herself invariably dressed in blacks. Note the plural: Kawakubo used so much, it was possible to see shades and nuances of black in her collections. She wasn’t the first to design in black, of course — Chanel transformed it from a color of mourning into a color of fashion in the 1920s, with her little black dresses, and designers had used it ever since. But by the 1980s, it had fallen out of favor with the rising preference for flashier colors — the brilliant pinks and greens of Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler — and the greiges and navies of Giorgio Armani. Black had never been used with Kawakubo’s severity and insistence — she’s used the word “strength” to describe the color. But in 1988, Kawakubo seemed to abruptly change course: She showed a fall collection dominated by rich scarlet. The thought process behind the decision? “Red is black,” she said at the time. Kawakubo’s challenge to color — and perhaps, as the French theorist Jean Baudrillard reasoned, to the idea of women sporting loud hues being transformed into ‘objects’ — is one of the most important fashion statements of the late 20th century. It transformed black into a color of fashion, intellectualism and rebellion — women who wore her clothes were dubbed “the crows.” And when the Harvard School of Design gave Kawakubo an Excellence in Design Award in 2000, they stated that she “invented” black. Maybe not — but she did reinvent it."
