The sword is placed in our hands by force. I hope that, if at the last moment my efforts to bring about an understanding between ourselves and our adversaries and to maintain the peace do not succeed, we may, by the help of God, so use our swords that when all is ended we can replace them in their scabbards with honor.

Paperback Row,2014-08-01,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Paperback books of particular interest.,"SUBTLE BODIES,  by Norman Rush. (Vintage International, $15.) A sophisticated romp through the joys and tribulations of friendship and marriage, Rush’s third novel has many of the qualities that defined its predecessors, “Mating” and “Mortals.” In 2003, with the invasion of Iraq looming, a group of college friends and self-styled wits, now middle-aged, gather in the Catskills after the sudden death of their ringleader."

Inside the List,2014-08-01,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"With the debut of Daniel Halper’s “Clinton, Inc.” at No. 10, there are now three volumes related to Bill and Hillary Clinton on the hardcover nonfiction list.","Power Couple: The title of Daniel Halper’s “Clinton, Inc.” refers to the marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton — Halper, the online editor at The Weekly Standard, argues that the couple function as co-chief executives of a mighty enterprise whose main business is politics. But you could be forgiven for thinking his title also describes the publishing industry. With the book’s debut this week at No. 10, there are now three Clinton-related volumes on the hardcover nonfiction list; Halper joins Edward Klein, whose “Blood Feud” is No. 3 after five weeks, and Hillary Clinton herself, whose “Hard Choices” is No. 5 after seven weeks. This state of affairs is nothing new. By my count, the Clintons have featured in more than 60 best sellers since entering the national stage in 1992. And they retain a close interest in what’s written about them, according to Halper. “While I was still reporting on my book,” he told Politico last month, “James Carville’s office called, seemingly out of the blue, to grill me on whom I’d already spoken to. I obviously refused to indulge the questioner.” Halper also said that Clinton’s publisher had reached out to his publisher for information about the book, and that “Clintonites” were scrambling to identify his unnamed sources. “I’ve found the task of covering the Clintons fascinating,” he said. “They’re not exactly the people we see on television.” They may, however, be the people we see in literature — Halper sets his tone by opening “Clinton, Inc.” with a damning line from “The Great Gatsby”: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into . . . whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”"

The Music of Time,2014-08-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In many of Jane Gardam’s stories, a figure from the past suddenly looms.","A novel can afford to unveil its secrets slowly. Not so a short story. With its constricted circuitry, it has to be a stairway of surprise (in Emerson’s phrase) or the reader will stop climbing at the second or third step. The most incisive stories by Jane Gardam, a writer well known in Britain for children’s books and a host of novels (including the “Old Filth” trilogy that has recently won her new readers in America), are constructed, more often than not, around a double take. From colonial postings abroad, from buried love affairs, from the lists of the presumed dead (or “near-dead,” as they are called in one of Gardam’s ghost-ridden stories), a once-familiar figure suddenly looms. The unsettling appearance of such revenants — as in Proust or Anthony Powell’s “A Dance to the Music of Time” — brings about, in these deftly written tales, a shift, a re-evaluation, a fresh sense of what really happened in the past and an opening into a possibly altered future."
Mind Ablaze,2014-08-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"The poet and novelist Stephen Crane “raced through his life,” documenting war and poverty until his death at 28.","Stephen Crane, whose likeness appears on the album cover of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” was America’s first rock-star writer. He self-published his realist novella “Maggie: A Girl of the Streets” at 21, losing so much money that he took to starving himself and wearing rubber boots because he couldn’t afford shoes. By the time he was 23, he had imagined “a creature, naked, bestial, / Who, squatting upon the ground, / Held his heart in his hands, / And ate of it. / I said, ‘Is it good, friend?’ / ‘It is bitter — bitter,’ he answered; / ‘But I like it / Because it is bitter, / And because it is my heart.’ ” "

I can’t tell you, because I was too thoroughly swept away by this richly imagined and continually surprising novel to be concerned with cute comparisons. "

Rules of Style | Danny Bowien on How to Look Sharp and Why He Chopped His Locks,2014-08-01,article,News,,['Restaurants'],"The chef behind Mission Chinese and MIssion Cantina discusses biking style, where to buy the best T-shirts and the virtues of kitchen clogs.","The chef and restaurateur Danny Bowien claims he’s not into fashion, but he’s clearly got his own idiosyncratic ideas about style. A typical look involves an oversize, vintage Bulls athletic tank jersey turned inside out, blazing red nylon shorts from Creatures of Comfort and dark leather Bragard slip-on kitchen shoes paired with black knit socks. His trademarks are a pair of worn-in, sciencey specs and his two-tone hair, which he recently trimmed himself. The cut was inspired both by his six-month-old son Mino (“I didn’t want to be that dad with weird hair”) and his insanely busy schedule, which leaves little time for grooming. With two restaurants to run — Mission Cantina in New York and Mission Chinese Food in San Francisco — along with various pop-ups, including his newest at Mile End Deli on Bond Street, Bowien has been living out of his Y-3 backpack and traveling on his 3Rensho bike whenever possible. Earlier this week, he took a break in between lunch and dinner services to talk about his love of band T-shirts, why he had to quit using cologne and his former stint as a Uniqlo model (watch out, it could happen again)."
Deep End,2014-08-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Yannick Murphy’s thriller “This Is the Water,” the mother of two girls on a competitive swim team is having an affair with her friend’s husband.","Rules, rules, so many stupid rules: “Don’t switch point of view.” “Don’t give away the identity of the killer.” “Don’t write in the second person.” Yannick Murphy, an author who seems drawn to high cliffs, ignores all the warnings in THIS IS THE WATER (Harper Perennial, paper, $14.99), an inventive thriller set in suburbia — and in the troubled minds of her characters. The second-person narrative voice that feels alienating at the outset (“This is the water. . . . This is the swim mom. . . . This is the bathroom”) soon becomes hypnotic (“This is you, Annie”) and then seriously unsettling (“This is the killer”). Annie, the mother of two girls on a competitive swim team, is the most appealing of all the moms in their pretty New England town who shell out $1,000 per child to get their kids on the team and hundreds more for those sadistically engineered racing suits that are supposed to shave milliseconds off their records. But while Annie dutifully volunteers to time the girls’ practice swims and drive to out-of-town meets, she can never satisfy a fanatic like Dinah, who monitors everyone’s moves and complains that “Annie and her daughters always seem to be doing what they’re not supposed to do.”"
What the Hearts Want,2014-08-01,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Fifty-nine short stories about love and other passionate longings, tinged with surreal potential, by Stuart Dybek, a master of the form.","Our American present seems best served by a literature of swerves. Whiplash plot changes. Arrivals that surprise, departures that are kicks in the teeth. Characters who veer violently off course: Think of poor Ned Stark from “A Game of Thrones,” or erratic Amy Dunne from “Gone Girl.” This is popular fiction’s response to the cloud of dark news that won’t quit raining on us. If life really has taken on a schizoid vibe, then maybe a narrative schizophrenia has come to look like real life."

Two of these elections have attracted intense media coverage, or will. India’s national elections, which took place in May, swept out of office the long-ruling Congress Party and handed government of a rising economic and political power to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Brazil’s elections, which will be held in October, are coming on the heels of the World Cup, one of several high-profile events that have marked the country’s emergence as the second giant of the Americas.

And essentially that’s what it is, though, if done right, those twists and turns have the elegance of choreography. Created by the Dutch design studio Game Oven, this recently released app steers users through entwining duets choreographed by Ernst Meisner of the Dutch National Ballet. To replicate the swinging, circular moves, you and your partner maneuver an icon along arcing, ever-shifting pathways, inevitably getting tangled. If we can’t put down our phones, Bounden exploits that isolating tendency to bring us closer — physically, at least. It’s fun, especially at early levels, where good dancing isn’t the point. As the game advances, it becomes trickier, monitoring your accuracy and flashing “Hurry up!” if you fall behind the music, like a good-natured ballet master. Videos, featuring dancers from Dutch National Ballet’s junior company, offer something to aspire to. (gameovenstudios.com.) "

Twenty-five years after Russian troops invaded East Prussia and German troops crossed the Belgian frontier, this anniversary has now completed the full cycle of change from a symbol of defeat to a harbinger of eventual German triumph. By Chancellor Hitler’s personal command, tomorrow will be a holiday for the entire German Army — the largest and strongest in German history. Every garrison in the Third Reich will hold special exercises to mark the beginning of four years of war which ended in defeat for Germany. This paradox is elaborated — if not explained — in columns of historical comment which fill the German press today. The grim situation in Europe this summer is explained in this official history as a parallel to that of 1914 only in its external form.

There is now a way to spend an unlimited amount on your child’s campaign for Congress, completely ignoring that annoying $2,600 legal limit on what you can give,” says an editorial in The New York Times. “All you do is set up a ‘super PAC’ for your kid and start writing checks.

A group calling itself Space PAC, in promoting Mr. Rothblatt’s campaign, “has raised $225,000, all of it from Martine Rothblatt.” The Times says, “family-financed super PACs are only the latest and most outrageous examples of how super PACs are used in this campaign cycle to evade the limits on donations.” Congress should pass the Empowering Citizens Act, “a bill introduced in the House that would put strict limits on these kinds of coordinated contributions.

First, lawmakers must institute a viable method of taxation — “policies that allow licensed businesses to undercut the illegal market but keep prices high enough so dependence on the drug does not increase a lot.” Second, distributors must not be permitted to market to minors: “Controls should emulate the restrictions on targeting young people, banning outdoor advertising and product placements that the tobacco industry accepted as part of its settlement with the state attorney general in 1998.” And finally, streams of cultivation and retail should be segregated — to avoid a similar system of juggernauts that dominates the tobacco industry. Ultimately, “whatever states decide to do, it is important that they stand ready to modify policies as legal marijuana markets evolve.”"

Whatever the case, I was now in the awkward position of having to drag him, kicking and screaming, down four flights of stairs (we lived in a walk-up) while also toting my younger boy, then an infant. So I canceled the play date (thus committing a “friendship fail,” too, all in one morning). "

The sharks are not all that hungry for humans, scientists say; seals are their preferred prey. One way great whites capture them is by breaching.

Muller, who traveled to False Bay, South Africa, to photograph sharks for a book coming out in 2015 from Taschen, said waiting for a shark in the dark is an intense experience. “They come up like a missile, knock the seal to shock it and then they bite it,” he says. “There’s no noise, no warning.

The promise of easy money must prod many into the field, but a vast majority of reality show participants never make substantial cash from their television appearances. What else is there, then? Well — duh — fame. And what is the purpose of fame? Well — duh — more fame. "

You Mean It’s Not Dead?,2014-08-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Michael Schmidt surveys 700 years of the novel, from Austen to Zola.","Michael Schmidt’s 1,172 pages encompass similarly big numbers. Seven hundred years of fiction are chronicled, hundreds of novelists looked at, and even more novels summarized. The biggest number of all, which can only be guessed at, wincingly, is how many hours of reading this intrepid book distills between its straining covers. Schmidt reveres Cervantes as one of the fathers of modern fiction, and there is something quixotic about Schmidt’s own enterprise. As the French general Bosquet said, watching the charge of the Light Brigade into the valley of death, “C’est magnifique.” But, to paraphrase the second half of his tribute, “Ce n’est pas la critique littéraire.” It is not literary criticism — at least not the currently approved kind that gets you a Ph.D., tenure and an endowed chair.

What’s on TV Wednesday,2014-08-13,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9:45 P.M. (HBO2) ARGO (2012) Ben Affleck, above, directed and stars in this Oscar winner for best film, which covers a little-known chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis, in which Antonio J. Mendez, a Central Intelligence Agency officer and a wizard of disguise, was tapped to help free six State Department employees stranded in Tehran after revolutionary forces seized the United States Embassy on Nov. 4, 1979. His plan: to have them pose as a Canadian movie crew filming a science-fiction flick called “Argo.” John Goodman and Alan Arkin play the Hollywood makeup artist and producer who help him. Bryan Cranston, his neck tendons popping, is one of his bosses; and Clea DuVall, Tate Donovan, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham and Kerry Bishé are the escapees. After setting your pulse racing, Mr. Affleck “smoothly downshifts, easing from the high anxiety of the opener — which evokes 1970s political thrillers like Sydney Pollack’s ‘Three Days of the Condor’ — into something looser, mellower and funny,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

For decades whites used zoning laws to keep blacks out of desirable areas; among black residents “within the city, poverty and unrest grew.” The black population has also been subjected to intervention from the largely white police force “far out of proportion to their population,” according to the editorial. “The circumstances of Mr. Brown’s death are, inevitably, in dispute,” says the editorial, but “what is not in dispute is the sense of permanent grievance held by many residents and shared in segregated urban areas around the country.” Mr. Brown’s death serves as “a reminder of a toxic racial legacy that still infects cities and suburbs across America.”"

Hybrids From a Fervid Iconoclast,2014-08-14,article,Review,,['Art'],"A Lucas Samaras show at the Metropolitan Museum emphasizes the diversity of his artistic output, from Happenings to works in which he tinkered with his own image.","Despite its grand, somewhat romantic title, “Lucas Samaras: Offerings From a Restless Soul” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art demonstrates quite clearly that Mr. Samaras is at his best as an artist when he settles down — particularly with photography, the medium he’s most associated with. Unfortunately this show, drawn from the museum’s collection — particularly a cache of works bequeathed to the Met by Mr. Samaras’s art dealer, Arnold Glimcher, and Mr. Glimcher’s wife, Milly — is rather slim on photography. Instead, it tries to bolster Mr. Samaras’s status as a versatile artist, with negligible results. "

Them Dames,2014-08-14,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Graphic Novels']",Jules Feiffer’s graphic novel is a tribute to film noir and detective fiction.,"Oedipus gets all the buzz, but surely a daughter’s desire to vanquish her mother is even more elemental. Not because daughters want to sleep with their daddies (although they sometimes do, as long as they’re de facto daddies; see “Mildred Pierce”), but because it’s so darn hard to become yourself with Mother hovering. You want — no, need — to dance in the Trevi Fountain and there’s Mommy, holding your galoshes. Veda Pierce, come to think of it, had a similar complaint about Mildred: “I literally can’t open my mouth in a theater, or a radio studio, or anywhere, that she isn’t there, bustling down the aisle, embarrassing me before people.” Mother is omnipresent until she’s not, and then you hate her even more for daring to leave you."

You remember ice. The stuff that forestalled so many polar explorers back before global warming and dreams of beachfront homes along the shores of Baffin Bay. But, as Hampton Sides reminds us in this first-rate polar history and adventure narrative, the notion of mildish weather in the Arctic did not begin with climate change. Just 150 years ago many believed that the Gulf Stream and its counterpart in the Pacific, the Kuroshio, reached all the way to the North Pole. Once a ship broke through a rim of ice circling the top of the globe, the thinking went, it would encounter an open polar sea and easy sailing to the pole. "
May Loves December,2014-08-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Lucinda Franks’s memoir of her marriage is a tribute to her husband.,"The secret to a long and passionate union is to marry someone almost 30 years your senior. That seems to be the message of Lucinda Franks’s engaging memoir, “Timeless: Love, Morgenthau, and Me.” Of course it helps if that someone is Robert M. Morgenthau, scion of a historic family, on the cusp of an extraordinarily long-running career as Manhattan’s district attorney. But the real subject of this brave, highly personal account of the Morgenthaus’ shared life is the mysterious alchemy that forges an unlikely couple out of two dissimilar souls. This is also a love story in a political context: the great events in New York’s life in the last 40 years, observed by a sharp reporter from a privileged perch."

Taking Wing in a Time of Extremis,2014-08-14,article,Review,,['Art'],"The artist Jim Hodges is the subject of a career retrospective, “Give More Than You Take,” at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston.","BOSTON — In the 21st century, we tend to talk about new art in terms of medium and style: Performance is back, painting is back, Pop is back, and so on. But for roughly a decade, from the late 1980s to the late 1990s, the emphasis was on ideas and emotions. As racial and gender politics navigated the culture wars, and the toll taken by AIDS grew overwhelming, content often trumped form. In a lesson learned from feminism, personal history and feeling were O.K. Even spirituality, which the New York art world handles with tongs, became an admissible subject."

King after he was beaten by Los Angeles police in the 1990s, said that he expected to file a complaint this week, and that the circumstances surrounding the shooting in South Los Angeles remained unclear. Police officials have said that Mr. Ford tackled an officer who had stopped him and lunged for the officer’s gun, which was secured in his holster. The officer’s partner then shot Mr. Ford and the first officer reached for a backup weapon to shoot as well. Mr. Lerman said that the police could have easily used less lethal options on Mr. Ford, whose family said he had a mental illness. “They could have used a Taser, they could have wrestled him to the ground, they did not have to shoot right away,” Mr. Lerman said. Cmdr. Andrew Smith, a police spokesman, said that Mr. Ford had continued to walk as the police tried to stop him and tried to conceal his hands. Residents who said they witnessed the shooting told local news media that they had seen no sign that Mr. Ford put up a struggle. "

Morning Views,2014-08-15,article,News,,[],"Opinions on abusive police tactics in Ferguson, the U.S. strategy against ISIS, the “death tax” in Washington state, Saudi Arabia’s commitment to fighting terrorism and Airbnb in Canada.","After a “night that startled the nation with images of police overkill,” higher authorities “wisely stepped into” Ferguson, Missouri, says an editorial in The New York Times. The St. Louis suburb was rocked by an incident last Saturday, when a police officer shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old. Residents held protests since the shooting, and were  “countered by aggressive street policing by officers outfitted in war gear who too often veered toward provocation more than protection.” The local authorities have refused to identify the police officer who shot the teenager. “Residents have a right to know whether the officer has a record of reckless behavior,” and whether the officer lives in the community. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said the protesters should be given the right to demonstrate, and that Ferguson “would become known ‘as a community that pulled together to overcome’ violence.” Bringing back a “sense of justice” will not be easy in the town where the majority of residents are black while the leadership is white, the editorial says. The authorities are warranted in responding “forcefully” to violence, but the “unyielding use of military tactics and abusive behavior” have widened the gap between them and the town’s residents. “Once the tear gas has dissipated, Mr. Nixon and Mr. Obama have an obligation to ensure that a real dialogue begins in Ferguson and other racially segregated areas, in hopes of keeping armored vehicles off the streets of America.”"

It was bad enough to steal the picture, they argued, but to return it fixed up according to his own ideas was almost a sacrilege. Yet not one of them was prepared to argue that Serge’s criticism of the work before he altered it was wrong. They only doubted that he was the man for the job. Meanwhile, the picture lies in a safe in the Louvre and in the days to come it will be studied by a group of specialists. It may be, as some believe, that Serge has harmed it to some extent, or, as others believe, that he improved it. That will take time to determine, but the Louvre publicly admits the painting is still worth its $100,000 assessment value. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, August 16, 1939"

The argument might never have been settled had not a friend of Gaines’s come across an agricultural magazine advertising something called the Nel-Spot 007.

The idea was that the ears would then be fertilized by pollen from a different type of corn in the adjoining row, thus creating a hybrid. The year I was 13 my parents said that yes, I could have a horse if I earned the money to buy it, so I took on three acres, for $30 each."

The crime is such that knowledge of it will cause a great deal of emotional trauma. It would be hard (and probably unconstitutional) to prosecute the perpetrator while keeping the details of his crimes private. In general, should the victims be informed despite the trauma it will cause? What is the ethical obligation to the public at large? ARLO LYLE, MINNEAPOLIS"

1964: Vietnam Presidency to Khanh,2014-08-15,article,News,,['Politics and Government'],Highlights from the International Herald Tribune archives: South Vietnam gets a new head of state in 1964.,"CAP ST. JACQUES, South Vietnam — In a major revision of South Vietnam’s governmental structure, the military revolutionary council today [Aug. 16] ousted Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh as chief of state and gave Premier Nguyen Khanh sweeping new powers by electing him to the newly created post of president. The council, meeting at this seaside resort about 40 miles east of Saigon, also promulgated a new national charter similar to a provisional constitution. This action clears the way for the establishment of an appointed provisional national assembly within one month. There has been no assembly or post of president since President Ngo Dinh Diem was overthrown last November. The council blocked Gen. Khanh’s bid for a one-man rule during the previously declared state of emergency and insured that final authority would rest with the council as a whole. Gen. Khanh retains the position of council chairman and commander in chief of the armed forces. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, August 17, 1964 "

Some Assimilation Required,2014-08-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"As a Ukrainian family adapts to life in Brooklyn, memories of the old country linger.","Yelena Akhtiorskaya’s impressive debut novel, “Panic in a Suitcase,” considers the precarious position of émigrés ­trying to build a life in America — specifically, Ukrainian émigrés trying to build a life in Brooklyn’s Brighton Beach. Set there and in Odessa, Ukraine, the novel spans 15 years in the lives of the Nasmertov family. It opens in 1993 as Pasha, the only remaining family member in Odessa, visits Brighton Beach to see his cancer-stricken mother, the matriarch of the family. Pasha — sometimes called “the greatest poet not just in Odessa and not in all of Ukraine but in all of Russia” — is a beacon for his family, much to the curiosity of his young niece, Frida. Though the first half of the novel centers on the family’s attempt to coerce Pasha into moving to America, this beautifully drawn portrait of a splintered ­immigrant family is also about young ­Frida and her struggle to assimilate. Akhtiorskaya layers the novel with equal parts humor and anxiety, and expertly highlights the unease of having one foot in and one foot out of the old country. "

Using archival material and other sources, the experts ascertained that the Liebermann painting rightfully belonged to the descendants of the industrialist David Friedmann, they said in a statement on Sunday. The work is only the second of 458 disputed paintings, prints and drawings in the collection, known as the Munich Art Trove, that the panel of experts, convened by the German government, has determined was looted. The other, a Matisse, was found in June to have been stolen from the collector Paul Rosenberg. Yet the Matisse has not been returned to Mr. Rosenberg’s heirs, and the Liebermann is sure to face a similar fate, because of the legal limbo surrounding Mr. Gurlitt’s collection following his death. Although Mr. Gurlitt, the son of an art dealer who worked for the Nazis, left his collection to the Kunstmuseum Bern, it has not yet decided whether to accept the gift. An agreement signed between Mr. Gurlitt and German authorities binds the new owner to restitute any looted works, but that cannot happen until the gift is accepted. David Toren, a great-nephew of Mr. Friedmann’s who lives in New York, filed a lawsuit against the German government in hopes of speeding the return of his family’s art work. “This is a very important first step in returning the painting to its rightful owners and we hope that the German government will not further delay returning the painting,” Mr. Toren’s attorney, August J.

Mr. Schoenaerts is her perfect foil and complement, as large and coarse as she is small and delicate, and also as tender as she is tough.”"

Getting Groovy With Reactive Android,2014-08-18,article,News,,[],Mohit Pandey explains the reactive functional programming we are focusing on for our Android redesign.,"“Slow,” a word no one ever wants to see associated with their app. Delay and lag of as little as 100–200 milliseconds will be perceived by users as poor, slow performance. Keeping long running tasks on the main thread will result in that perception, the dreaded “Application Not Responding” (ANR) and a bad user experience. This leaves us developers one choice: concurrent execution of code. The recent growth in popularity of functional programming is well deserved. As things become more asynchronous, the functional model really fits well. Being able to sequence, chain and transform asynchronous operations can be considered a must. However, the mechanisms for asynchronous programming provided in Android leave much to be desired, especially when compared to the web development realm. Many of the ideas and techniques from “enterprise” Java frameworks have not yet migrated to the Android world. Practices that some would consider table stakes for web development on the JVM have just begun to trickle in on Android; dependency management and a modern build system, for example. We can even dream of one day receiving proper support for unit tests."

But with the right colleagues in chamber music and the right conductor in concertos, reined in just a bit, Ms. Argerich is often incomparable.

It happened, in spectacular fashion, 75 years ago. Out in Forest Hills, Bobby Riggs, fresh from victory at Wimbledon, defeated Welby Van Horn to take the singles title at the United States National Championships, while the incomparable Alice Marble repeated as women’s champion by putting away Helen Hull Jacobs. And over in Flushing Meadows, thousands of visitors were getting a glimpse of the “world of tomorrow” at the New York World’s Fair."

"In the Shadows, With Their Physical and Moral Impairments",2014-08-21,article,Review,,['Movies'],A criminal enforcer ends up working with an assassin’s blind sister in the Italian film “Salvo.”,"A soulful romance, an existential action flick and something of a miracle movie — the appealing slow-burner “Salvo” hovers at the crossroads of genre. Its story pulls in all directions, and its mood, tone and backdrop are as serious as a Mafia hit. Yet its setup has the makings of a comedy sketch: A Sicilian mobster, Salvo (Saleh Bakri, holding every inch of screen), meets a blind woman, Rita (Sara Serraiocco), who soon after begins to see the light. It’s a moment that summons the New Testament prophecy about the blind seeing, but it’s also old-fashioned movie-made hokum. "

It begins on a modest note. “Instead of going to the priest,” its opening sentence says, “the men who gathered at Doherty’s Bar after work went to Eileen Tumulty’s father.” But if Eileen, the book’s wrenchingly credible main character, had not been raised by such a secular Irish-born strongman (and an alcoholic mother as tender as an ice cube), her life would never have followed the path it did."

The protesters are angry, and they’re not aimlessly angry. They have a specific set of policy grievances about policing and criminal justice that are shared by a large slice of the electorate, particularly the Democratic primary electorate."

One is a stalwart of the Frick’s collection by El Greco, purchased in 1913, when Henry Clay Frick was building the Fifth Avenue mansion that was ultimately intended to become a museum for his extensive collection. The other painting, on loan from a private collection and rarely exhibited, is by El Greco’s Roman contemporary, Scipione Pulzone."

It is hard to avoid comparing “If I Stay,” which opens on Friday, with “The Fault in Our Stars,” but there is also no reason to choose between them.

What’s on TV Friday,2014-08-22,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) KILL YOUR DARLINGS (2013) A tale of the Beat movement in its larval stage, this film from John Krokidas pictures Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe), Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) and Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan, above with Mr. Radcliffe at left) as restless young intellectuals in 1940s New York City. (William S. Burroughs, less young but equally restless, is played by Ben Foster.) Ginsberg is the film’s protagonist and moral center, but the plot revolves around Carr’s friendship with his former teacher, David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), which edged into obsession and ended with a fatal confrontation in Riverside Park. The film “is at once a lurid true-crime chronicle and a coming-out story,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Its vision of the past is stereoscopic, affirming Allen’s erotic self-discovery even as it explores the shadows of the closet where he and his friends must dwell.” "

During the war, both sides made efforts to prevent the destruction of works of art in churches, museums and private collections. During the early phases of the struggle, anarchist fanatics defaced many sacred paintings, such as “Jesus and the Virgin,” by Roger Van der Weiden, in the St. Cruz Hospital in Toledo. The Republican authorities took pains to stop this destruction. As Franco’s troops occupied the country’s territory, the authorities immediately organized a service for the protection and reassembling of works of art. These services, directed by Eugenio d’Ors, now are engaged in checking losses and putting together the famous collections which have been dispersed. Some priceless antiques and works of art are definitely lost. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Aug. 23, 1939"

The markets are piled high with irresistible produce — summer squash, tomatoes, green beans, corn, peppers and chiles, greens and herbs – and corn tortillas are a great vehicle for them.We’ve seen enough taco trucks, especially here in Los Angeles, the home of the Korean taco, to know that you can wrap a warm tortilla around just about anything and call it a taco. I leave the kimchi out of my own (though I did make one unconventional filling with tofu, a sort of picadillo cooked and mashed in a salsa ranchera that proved to be irresistible) and stick to the Mexican seasonings I love: chiles and cilantro, cumin and chili powder and salsas. Vegetables were the focus of each filling, and all of this week’s tacos are vegetarian. I combined sweet corn and green beans in one, and roasted peppers, squash and potatoes seasoned with cumin and chile powder in another. I grabbed chard from my garden for a few of the fillings, and made use of this summer’s bounty of squash.I love the flavor of corn tortillas, and they’re a godsend for friends who have trouble with gluten. I buy them in packs of three dozen, then divide the packages so I can freeze them by the dozen because I usually don’t use 36 tortillas in a week (though this week, I did). As for how much filling to count on for each taco, I follow Rick Bayless’s advice and use about a quarter cup. As he says, tacos are as much about the tortilla as they are about the filling, and you wouldn’t want to overwhelm the tortilla any more than you’d want to overwhelm pasta with too much sauce."

What’s on TV Tuesday,2014-08-26,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10:05 A.M. (Flix) THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS (2002) In Jeff Stockwell’s screen adaptation of Chris Fuhrman’s novel, directed by Peter Care, the teenage friends Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) cope with the anxieties of education, puberty and first love by writing a series of superhero comics. “The masterstroke of this small, heartfelt directorial debut,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, “is its integration of animated sequences (by Todd McFarlane) in which action-adventure caricatures of the comic book characters parallel or comment on events in the boys’ lives.” Those lives are darkened as the film progresses, most affectingly by a story of familial abuse shared by Francis’s new girlfriend, Margie Flynn (Jena Malone). Jodie Foster plays Sister Assumpta, an especially reviled teacher at the boys’ Roman Catholic school. Mr. Holden wrote: “Ms. Foster, who seems to grow primmer with each film, locates the compassion beneath her character’s grim, authoritarian surface. Like tiny ripples on a pond, her face registers the concerns of a caring surrogate parent committed to practicing an austere form of tough love.”"

Thirteen years later, the settlement that sprang up was named for Charlotte Sophia, the wife of England’s King George III. But it wasn’t until 1799 that Charlotte’s emergence as a financial center began, with the discovery of a 17-pound gold nugget in the northern woods, sparking the nation’s first gold rush. In the years since, Charlotte has endured war, poverty, racial strife and financial crisis on its way to becoming a global banking powerhouse. Today, Polk’s original crossroads lies in the shadow of the Bank of America tower in the heart of an eminently walkable downtown, which Charlotteans call Uptown. In the last decade, escapees from jobs in the corporate world have revitalized nearby enclaves like Dilworth, NoDa and Plaza Midwood, leaving galleries, breweries and farm-to-table enterprises in their wake — all increasingly linked by greenway, bike route and light rail. The “Queen City” is smaller and easier to navigate than, say, Atlanta, and is an excellent place to soak up the new Old South."

Adam Tanner’s ostensible objective is to reveal big secrets about how Las Vegas casinos, notably those owned by Caesars Entertainment, collect and use data that customers drop when they visit, just as they drop money. Surely, there’s something sexier about this than there is about the way Amazon analyzes you based on your purchases. Surely there’s something about gambling that makes it different from surfing the web. Not exactly. Mr. Tanner, a fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard and a former Reuters bureau chief, spends a lot of time covering familiar ground. And not all of it is in Nevada. He starts at Harvard Business School, where Gary Loveman joined the faculty at 29 and became known for an article about the financial value of customer satisfaction. As part of his job, he trained executives from Harrah’s, the casino giant. A few years later, he left academia to become Harrah’s chief operating officer and moved to Las Vegas. He may have been the only guy in town who used words like “stochastic” and “vitiate” in conversation. "

Toward the end of July, we began talking to Paolo and Peter about going into Gaza and Israel, respectively, to make some pictures. We had noticed that during this summer’s outbreak of violence, the prevalence of cellphone cameras and social media led to many more images of Gaza than in previous iterations of this long-running conflict. This imagery made the cost of war visually appreciable in a way that it had not been even as recently as 2009. Yet as powerful as these photos were, the speed and fervor of their dissemination tended to bring them to us isolated from context. Paolo and Peter, working more slowly, could try to capture a deeper and more narrative sense of the texture of life on the ground."

The juxtaposition of innocence and cruelty, of a naïve ignorance of political causes with a vivid understanding of their human effect, can refresh and deepen our perception of past atrocities. But there are risks, too: of sentimentality, of vagueness and of a wide-eyed naïveté that mystifies events we have an ethical duty to see as clearly as possible. For every “Pan’s Labyrinth,” which mines archetypes and fairy tales to unearth the hidden truth of Spanish fascism, there is “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,” which turns the Holocaust into maudlin kiddie-kitsch."

As played by Kevin Kline with an almost disconcerting low-key openness, Flynn trades on his name recognition with an earnest, self-deprecating manner, though that is itself a form of entitlement. A go-between reaches out first to 15-year-old Beverly Aadland (Dakota Fanning), who is invited to a play audition in a country house borrowed for the purpose, which is not to audition. (In 1943 Flynn was acquitted of statutory rape in a case whose notoriety stuck.)"

Vera Farmiga is Alex, the fast-moving executive who, for the first time, causes Bingham to rethink his life. “ ‘Up in the Air’ is an assertively, and unapologetically, tidy package, from its use of romance to instill some drama into the narrative (the book introduces disease instead) and the mope-rock tunes that Mr. Reitman needlessly overuses,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of the Walter Kirn novel. Still, one of the film’s pleasures is that its actresses “share the frame with Mr. Clooney as equals, not props.” The film, chosen by Ms. Dargis as a critic’s pick, received Oscar nominations for its three leads and Mr. Reitman, as well as a best picture nod."

This reissued recording, “Duets of Love and Passion,” originally released in 1964, presents the couple in scenes from Saint-Saëns’ “Samson et Dalila,” Bizet’s “Carmen” and two Verdi operas, “Otello” and “Aida.” McCracken’s muscular voice and intensity combine excitingly with Warfield’s dark colorings and warmth. Though Warfield, who died in 2009, had to accommodate her voice with some awkwardness to the subtle demands of Verdi’s Desdemona, a classic soprano role, she smolders as Verdi’s Amneris. The recording includes bonus tracks from “McCracken on Stage,” an aria album that shows this important tenor, who died in 1988, was not just in his element in Wagner, but bending phrases sensitively in Verdi.

There was an air of expectancy in — when I reached it on Monday forenoon. News was scant and people were evidently becoming restless. Crowds were massed in the principal square watching the arrival from time to time of French soldiers with trophies captured from the enemy. Knots of men and women were gathered around villagers from the countryside and listening intently to vague accounts of fighting outside the city. About five o’clock the atmosphere in the streets began to change. It seemed panicky. Rumors were afloat that the Germans were arriving; that the Prefect had given orders for all the flags to be hauled down; that the Prussian cavalry would enter the city at nine o’clock! What these reports were worth at the time I do not know. But when, an hour or two later, I saw the officers in my hotel suddenly begin to pack their bags and pay their bills I considered it was time I prepared to move on, too, having no desire to be taken prisoner by the Germans. The tactics of the German cavalry is to appear here, there and everywhere, and the effect on the population is inevitable. We reached —— at noon. We felt at once that the Germans were near. There was that unmistakable atmosphere. A general air of deadness, stagnation and stifled fear; suspense and anxiety on every face. Scant news has filtered through of the great battle between Mons and Charleroi. It is, of course, a secondary line which has wisely fallen back on a stronger line in order to cope better with the German cavalry movement on our left, a movement which must be watched.— The New York Herald, European Edition, Aug. 30, 1914"

Basho went north from present-­day Tokyo through a mountainous land of often shattering beauty. Yet his walk was marked by moments of terrible loneliness, and he seemed to travel under a kind of compulsion, without a defined goal or purpose. Basho walks because he must, and in reading him the old cliché comes alive: Life is a journey. Whether that journey has any meaning, whether there’s anything beyond putting one foot in front of the other . . . well, that’s another question entirely."

Robert Timberg. He was on a routine mission to deliver pay to front-line units in Vietnam. The gas tank carried 456 gallons of fuel with little protection from underneath. If it exploded, anyone inside would be, as the Marines said, “fricasseed.” So the passengers sat on the top or clung to the sides.

Bodies of Evidence,2014-08-29,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In a nameless city, women are abducted, tattooed with crude maps and released.","The cast includes women who’ve been abducted, hooded, forcibly tattooed and released with no explanation. A bum, a stripper, a life coach, a real estate agent. They have nothing in common but the maps inked onto their backs — evidence of an unskilled hand, the maps illegible and crude. Playing the leads: a killer, Wrobleski; a hired thug, Billy Moore; his precocious 12-year-old daughter, Carla; a real estate mogul; and one cranky driver. In addition, two innocents turned amateur detectives — think “the Bloodhound Gang” (see PBS’s “3-2-1 Contact,” not the band) — who commit themselves, with no prelude or wherewithal, to solving the mystery of the tattooed women. And, as backdrop, a nameless city that feels like New York in about 50 years, but isn’t New York. Just some run-down urban mecca: corrupt, filthy, mysterious, cinematic. Put it all together and you’ve got Geoff Nicholson’s new crime novel, “The City Under the Skin,” which compels the way a good crime novel should: by making you turn the pages at a clip. "

In it, Ryan offers voters — oops, readers! — a softer, more personal account of his life, discussing among other things his courtship of his wife and opening up for the first time about his father’s alcoholism and early death. “Before I lost him to a heart attack,” Ryan writes, “whiskey had washed away some of the best parts of the man I knew.” None of this, of course, means the book isn’t full of your basic agitprop. Running a column about it last month, one Texas newspaper used the succinct headline “Ryan Blames Everything on Left.” So is this the first volley in a presidential campaign? Ryan has been noncommittal in interviews, saying he’ll wait until 2015 to decide.

What’s on TV Saturday,2014-08-30,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG (2013) Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to Smaug, the menacing dragon who lords over the lost dwarf kingdom and vast treasure in this second installment in Peter Jackson’s adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s book. Martin Freeman (who plays Watson to Mr. Cumberbatch’s Holmes on the television series “Sherlock”) once again portrays Bilbo, the hobbit who has been chosen to lead the fight for the reclamation.

Sixteen Negroes were accepted in four elementary schools here and by 10 a.m. this morning 14 were in first-grade classes. One of the two remaining Negroes was rejected when it was learned that the child’s parents live outside the state. The other is to attend a school that starts classes later.  The fact that there were no incidents today contrast sharply with the rioting that claimed two lives when Negro James Meredith enrolled at the University of Mississippi at Oxford two years ago. White parents sat in their cars in the vicinity of the four Biloxi schools long after their children had entered, but there was no attempt to interfere when the Negro youngsters appeared and walked shyly, holding their parents’ hands, into the schools. The mother of one of the Negro pupils later told a reporter: “Everything is OK, but it ain’t over yet.” School desegregation also came peacefully today to Columbia, S.C., for the first time as six formerly white schools in Columbia enrolled 22 Negro students. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 1, 1964"

Want More Wonka? A Lost Chapter Is Found,2014-08-31,article,Brief,,['Books and Literature'],A lost chapter of an earlier version of the 1964 book “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” was recently published for the first time in The Guardian.,"It appears that Roald Dahl, below, once planned for Charlie Bucket to have a lot more company and a somewhat wilder adventure in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” A lost chapter of an earlier version of this 1964 book that was found after Dahl’s death in 1990 was recently published for the first time in The Guardian. It reveals more temptations for a larger cast of characters and some variations on character names. The chapter opens with eight children — including Charlie, escorted by his mother instead of his Grandpa Joe — entering the Vanilla Fudge room. At this point, two other children, Miranda Grope and Augustus Pottle, who later became Augustus Gloop, have already fallen into the chocolate river. Inside the room, the visitors see a mountain of chocolate where hundreds of workers (later called Oompa-Loompas) are chipping away chunks of fudge that are then loaded onto wagons and transported through a dark hole in the wall. Two children, Tommy Troutbeck and Wilbur Rice, disobey Willy Wonka and jump into the wagons. They are quickly swept away through the hole into the “Pounding and Cutting Room.” Wonka tells the parents that this room is where the fudge is pounded “against the floor until it is all nice and smooth and thin.” After that, he says, “a whole lot of knives come down and go chop chop chop, cutting it up into neat little squares, ready for the shops.” The chapter did not make the book because it was “deemed too wild, subversive and insufficiently moral for the tender minds of British children almost 50 years ago,” The Guardian said. “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide in 55 languages, according to RoaldDahl.com, and has been made into two movies and a musical."
