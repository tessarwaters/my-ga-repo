The dramatic volcano would have been an obvious choice of subject for Gall, whose work has focused on nature — from formal gardens to underground caves — for more than three decades. But there, in the ancient city of Syracuse, a surprising fascination emerged: “As I walked through all the narrow streets,” she says, “my gaze was drawn upward to a swirl of moving color, which turned out to be laundry hung out to dry from balconies.” Over the next two years, Gall traveled to seaside cities in Italy, Cuba and Croatia, capturing the movement and forms of hanging laundry and, later, kites. Inspired by the nonrepresentational paintings of Kandinsky and Miró, she pared away all but the essential details, developing abstract compositions against clear blue skies. The resulting series — now on view at Julie Saul Gallery in New York City — is transformative: In image after image, whirling, wind-tossed dish towels, dresses and denim conjure the shapes and colors of blooming poppies and flocks of birds.

What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this reader’s life, provided a lifeline. Perhaps her greatest legacy was her refusal to cede to societal expectations as she carved out a persistently unusual world for herself in which the demands of femininity — marriage and children, specifically — were rethought and redefined."

The book is a collection of short pieces, quasi- or semi-fictional but based in reality, touching on aspects of life in the part of western Turkey where Sinan (Aydin Dogu Demirkol) and his family live. Pitching the manuscript to a local government official he thinks might subsidize its publication, the author is at pains to describe it in resolutely anti-commercial terms. Though the area includes the battle sites of both Troy and Gallipoli, there is nothing of historical or touristic interest in the work. It’s defiantly cerebral — resistant to summary, classification and perhaps easy comprehension as well. Like the movie, more or less."

How Iran’s Greatest Director Makes Art of Moral Ambiguity,2019-01-31,article,News,,"['Movies', 'Censorship', 'Muslims and Islam']",Asghar Farhadi’s films fill theaters in a country where taking sides can be dangerous. They’ve also captivated Hollywood.,"Asghar Farhadi, the most successful director in the history of Iranian cinema, may have little interest in global politics, but global politics are interested in him. On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after “The Salesman,” Farhadi’s seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days — apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out “what the hell is going on.” For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trump’s order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of “reciprocal humiliation” that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that “reciprocal” showed extraordinary equanimity — not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised."

Early in January, she announced to her 830,000 followers that she would be holding a series of four-hour, $165 seminars in several American cities, a chance for fans to meet Calloway and imbibe some of her wisdom on “true creative fulfillment.” What followed was a fiasco: Early seminars failed to deliver promised amenities, and Calloway turned out to have sold tickets to some events without having located venues for them. A muckraking Twitter thread materialized, scorning Calloway as a “scammer”; she promptly canceled and then uncanceled the tour, all while zapping out flurries of alternately self-flagellating and self-justifying posts on Instagram Stories."

‘Piercing’ Review: A Killer Romance,2019-01-31,article,Review,,['Movies'],Christopher Abbott plays a character who thinks his baby is telling him to commit murder and dismemberment.,"A grisly comedic thriller written and directed by Nicolas Pesce (his 2016 horror film “The Eyes of My Mother” got some positive notes), “Piercing” has an audaciousness that largely lies in splitting the difference between viewer interest and viewer exasperation. A movie that begins with a father (Christopher Abbott) standing over his newborn’s crib holding an ice pick behind his back can’t be said to be pulling any introductory punches."
‘Daughter of Mine’ Review: Lessons in Imperfect Parenting,2019-01-31,article,Review,,['Movies'],"Ardent and primal, Laura Bispuri’s drama addresses complicated ideas with head-clearing simplicity.","There’s a wonderful wildness to “Daughter of Mine,” an electricity that feels untamable. It’s in the wind that blasts across the scrubby Sardinian landscape, demanding purpose from characters who seem always in danger of being buffeted off course. And it radiates from Angelica (a magnificent Alba Rohrwacher), the village floozy who services local men in exchange for free drinks. Frequently drunk and always disheveled, Angelica lives in virtual squalor, a mangy menagerie in her yard and an eviction notice on her kitchen table."
