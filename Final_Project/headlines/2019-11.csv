What’s on TV Friday: ‘Dickinson’ and ‘American Son’,2019-11-01,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",A new series tells a coming-of-age story based loosely on the life of Emily Dickinson. And an adaptation of a recent Broadway play hits Netflix.,"DICKINSON Stream on Apple TV Plus. Emily Dickinson is imbued with teenage angst and a vocabulary that includes words like “dude” and “sick” in this series debuting Friday as one of the first shows on Apple’s new streaming service. “Dickinson,” which stars Hailee Steinfeld as a version of the 19th-century poet, reimagines Dickinson as a patriarchy-fighting millennial who throws ragers, relentlessly pursues her creative impulses and hangs out with a personification of death played by the rapper Wiz Khalifa. She also rebels against her overbearing father and has a romance with her future sister-in-law. In a recent interview with The New York Times, the show’s creator, Alena Smith, described “Dickinson” as “a coming-of-age story about a radical young female artist who was ahead of her time.” The tone calls to mind teen dramas like “Riverdale.” Part of the idea, Smith said, is to consider Dickinson through a modern lens. “If she wasn’t that well understood in her time,” Smith asked, “can we understand her better in ours?”"

Letter of Recommendation: Radio Garden,2019-11-05,article,News,,"['Radio', 'Music']",Listening to live radio from around the world provides a vivid — and limited — window onto distant places.,"On Tuesday, Oct. 1, at 11:25 a.m. local time, a radio station in Torshavn in the Faroe Islands played a song called “Rave in the Grave,” by the Swedish D.J.

If I were further pushed, I would say that I am sorry to have heard it, because it will be with me always now, but that I liked the idea of someone in the Faroe Islands — this sparsely populated Danish archipelago in the middle of the North Atlantic where they have developed a specialized term for the problem of falling off a cliff, so often does it happen because of the sudden onset of fog — jerking back from the radio in bewildered disgust at the same moment that I did in my kitchen in Cape Town."

The space also doubles as Condit’s studio, but other than a laptop and a few hard drives, scant evidence of a working artist could be found. Over grapes and pudding, we watched my iPhone, which was spitting out audio from “Possibly in Michigan,” Condit’s brutal, surreal and darkly funny 1983 art musical that is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Shot using then nascent video technology and set to an eerily chipper Casio-fueled soundtrack provided by Karen Skladany, who also acted in the film, the 12-minute “Possibly in Michigan” follows a masked cannibal named Arthur — played by, at different points, Condit and the actors Bill Blume and Stephen Vogel — as he stalks Jill Sands (playing a character named Sharon) and Skladany (as Sharon’s friend Janice) through a nondescript Middle American shopping mall. (Despite its name, the video was filmed in Cleveland, where Condit was living at the time.) The cannibal follows the women home, at which point he’s murdered and then eaten himself. The film ends with the body being disposed in a couple of trash bags and picked up by a local garbage collector."

How to Set Up a Shell Company,2019-11-07,article,News,,['Tax Shelters'],"Do it in Nevada or Delaware or Wyoming. Pick a bland, forgettable name for the company.","“If you’re looking for secrecy, the United States is a far better bet than the classic tropical-island tax haven,” says Jason Sharman, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Cambridge. To study the effectiveness of international rules against anonymous, untraceable shell companies, Sharman and two other researchers impersonated 21 different fictitious consultants and sent 7,400 emails to 3,700 so-called corporate service providers (often law or accounting firms) in 182 countries, asking for help setting one up. Nearly half the respondents failed to comply with regulations requiring the collection of identity documents. The conclusion: It is more than three times as hard to put an untraceable shell company in an offshore tax haven than in a developed country. For anonymity, set up your company in Nevada, Delaware or Wyoming; it can be done in 10 to 40 minutes, and for as little as $200."

Can a Woman Who Is an Artist Ever Just Be an Artist?,2019-11-07,article,News,,"['Art', 'Women and Girls', 'Nudism and Nudity', 'Men and Boys']","The lives of two painters, Celia Paul and Cecily Brown, tell very different stories about what it takes to thrive in a medium historically dominated by men.","In a recent feature film about the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, we find the great man in his Paris studio, brooding over the difficulty of giving birth to his own genius. Fuming and raging, lashing out at his familiars, he is a chain-smoking wild beast being kept in cultural captivity. His growing fame brings admirers to his freezing workshop, where they wonder at his ascetic indifference to discomfort, and still more — gifted as he surely is — at his capacity for self-criticism. Not that his manhood can be in any doubt: He flaunts his ravishing young mistress before his careworn, miserable wife, who nonetheless remains his devoted slave in the fervent belief that she is the one who truly understands him. In one scene, in a fit of furious dissatisfaction, he hurls a sheaf of sketches into a flaming brazier before a group of astonished onlookers. The camera shows the horror on their faces as they watch the artworks burn, a horror it is assumed we share. It isn’t just the sight of Giacometti’s sketches going up in smoke that appalls us; it’s the fact that, to our retrospective eyes, he might as well be burning thousand-dollar bills."

I needed blueprints for my epic sadness, and no one captured epic sadness as well as Jean Rhys, especially — and unapologetically — in her 1939 novel, “Good Morning, Midnight.” The novel’s antiheroine, Sasha, tries to drink herself to death in a cheap Paris hotel room — haunted by her lost youth, her botched romances and the ghost of her infant son, who died at 5 weeks old. As soon as I read the first scene, in which a stranger chides Sasha for crying at a bar (“Sometimes I’m just as unhappy as you are. But that’s not to say that I let everybody see it”), I knew which team I was on: Team Sasha, Team Rhys, Team Drunk-Crying-in-Public."

He trained as an architect and has worked as a D.J., artist, musician and Kanye West whisperer. When it comes to fashion, his references are equally wide-ranging, and he’s proved as likely to send trench coats and pleated pants down the runway as mesh tees and floral harnesses. With his latest capsule collection, he’s baked versatility into individual pieces. Included in the 14-item line, called Louis Vuitton 2054 (the year the brand will turn 200), is a shirt that turns into a pillow, a weekend bag that morphs into a sleeping bag and a coat that doubles as a backpack. It was, according to Abloh, an exercise in rethinking the nature of apparel and what the future of fashion will be. He arrived at his answer — technical and transformable — after looking at collapsible camping equipment. “I was very much inspired by the materials and folding ingenuity that exists in that world of products,” Abloh said, in comments emailed by the brand. Indeed, folding is an integral component in experiencing these multifunctional items: The shirt, papery nylon with removable arms and plexiglass zipper pulls, can be tucked into its own back pocket, and the sleeping bag rolls out of the side compartment of an oversize lambskin duffel."

This time: the producer and the musician.,"One measure of artistic success is the ability to move the mainstream — to bring once-unimaginable ideas to the widest possible audience. By that metric, few people have been as successful as the musician David Byrne and the producer David Binder. Byrne, of course, headlined the ’80s rock band Talking Heads, which dissolved the barriers between disco and rock, conceptual art and dance pop. Even before going solo in 1989, Byrne’s side projects tentacled into disparate worlds: He collaborated with similarly polymathic artists such as Brian Eno, Robert Wilson and Twyla Tharp; he starred in the writer-director Jonathan Demme’s 1984 documentary “Stop Making Sense”; and two years later, he directed the Robert Altman-on-acid jukebox art film “True Stories.” In the ’90s and beyond, Byrne used his fame to advance and collaborate with a wide range of artists — the world-music acts on his label, Luaka Bop; the D.J. Fatboy Slim on “Here Lies Love,” their 2013 musical about Imelda Marcos; the singer St. Vincent on their joint 2012 album “Love This Giant.” His latest act of radical pop is “American Utopia,” an album and touring rock show (which debuted in 2018) that wears its theme lightly but seriously reimagines space: Mobile musicians hop across a bare stage, dancing to their own music.

Formed around a central caldera and characterized by lunar-like rock formations, it has the highest concentration of beaches in the entire island group — and yet, it’s delightfully untrodden compared to its more famous neighbors, Santorini and Mykonos. It was once a critical location for the mineral trade — during the Neolithic period, the ancient Minoans exported Milos’s obsidian to the neighboring Aegean island of Crete, whose residents used the volcanic glass to make weapons — but the island is best known because of an event from more recent history. It was while digging near the Roman amphitheater in Klima, in 1820, that the amateur archaeologist Olivier Voutier discovered the marble statue known as the “Venus de Milo.” The celebrated work now lives at the Louvre in Paris, but Milos’s mystique remains intact. Thanks to its serene fishing villages, secluded caves, innumerable swimming beaches (many accessible only by boat) and an abundance of locally run restaurants offering fresh catch and regional Greek wines, this tranquil island is quickly gaining appeal for travelers who want Aegean charm without the crowds."

The series feels like a cross between “Dead to Me” and “This Is Us,” and sees Leigh and her family struggle through the healing process. In the Season 2 finale, Leigh confronts an upsetting revelation about her husband, Matt (Mamoudou Athie), and her sister Jules (Kelly Marie Tran) plans to take a summer trip abroad."

Will Science Ever Give Us a Better Night’s Sleep?,2019-11-19,article,News,,"['Sleep', 'Genetics and Heredity', 'Research', 'Brain']",Unraveling the mysteries of sleep might depend on studying the genes of people who don’t get much.,"We humans spend a third of our lives asleep, oblivious to our surroundings and temporarily paralyzed. It’s a vulnerability that would seem to diminish our odds of survival, so evolutionarily speaking it must also somehow confer tremendous benefits. Yet our best guesses about what those benefits are tend to come from observing what happens when sleep is curtailed. As far as we know, all animals sleep in some way; deprive most of them of it for long enough, and they will die, but exactly why is unclear. In 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society published a joint statement, based on a comprehensive review of research, saying that “sleeping less than seven hours per night on a regular basis” — which is the case for an estimated 35 to 40 percent of Americans during the workweek — is associated with adverse health outcomes. These include weight gain and obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and stroke, depression, impaired immune function, increased pain, greater likelihood of accidents and “increased risk of death.” The National Institutes of Health reported last year that sleep deficits may increase the beta-amyloid proteins in the brain linked with Alzheimer’s disease. But when it comes to “what sleep is, how much you need and what it’s for,” says Louis Ptacek, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, “we know almost nothing — other than it’s bad not to get enough of it.” Indeed, says David Dinges, one of the statement’s authors and a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, “All of this makes it really tough to send out simple messages to the public about when you should sleep and how much you should sleep.”"

An Artist Who Makes Paintings Without a Canvas,2019-11-19,article,News,,"['Art', 'Blacks', 'Black People', 'Paint']","Ahead of a new solo show, Suzanne Jackson talks about her creative routine, her love of jazz music and the worst studio she ever had.","Suzanne Jackson isn’t fond of the term “overachiever,” though you wouldn’t be wrong to call her one. At 75, she has had a long, storied, multi-hyphenate career as a painter, poet, dancer, teacher, curator and theater designer. She’s not a fan of the word “career” either: “It’s my life’s work,” she says. “There’s just a lot of things to be interested in.” Jackson traces that attitude back to her childhood in 1940s and ’50s pre-statehood Alaska, where a certain pioneering spirit prevailed. “We just did things,” she remembers. She went to college at San Francisco State University at 17, studying art, drama and dance; toured South America as a ballerina; and in 1967, moved to Los Angeles, where she tooled around town in a Buick Hearse, took drawing classes from Charles White, began showing her paintings at the influential Ankrum gallery and, in 1968, opened Gallery 32, the community-minded space she ran out of her studio near MacArthur Park for two years. There, she hosted exhibitions by emerging black artists like David Hammons and Betye Saar, as well as a fund-raiser for the Black Panthers. As a single mother in her 40s with her son in tow, she earned a graduate degree in theater design at Yale, worked on productions with the Kennedy Center and the Berkeley Repertory Theater and eventually settled in Georgia in the mid-90s to teach at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She has now lived and worked in the city for two decades, in a rambling, three-story, double-wide 1890s house that she owns in the historic Starland district."

A Cocktail Necklace That Demands Attention,2019-11-25,article,News,,"['Parties (Social)', 'Jewels and Jewelry']","With the early 20th-century emergence of the cocktail party came cocktail jewelry: bright, brazen, sparkling. Now, Tiffany & Co. offers a new take.","Alec Waugh, brother of the novelist Evelyn, claimed in a 1974 Esquire interview to have invented the cocktail party, though a St. Louis socialite, Clara Bell Walsh, is often credited with throwing the first pre-dinner soiree devoted exclusively to mixed drinks in 1917. Amid the giddiness of the post-World War I period, when women began to assert themselves more at social events and Prohibition made booze alluringly naughty, dimly lit get-togethers became fashionable. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the era also saw the birth of cocktail jewelry: massive gems, both precious and semiprecious, in rings and pendants, made to be brazenly visible even in low light. By the 1940s, Tiffany & Co. was known for such oversize pieces, especially with aquamarine surrounded by diamonds. The ice-blue mineral, which, like emerald, is part of the beryl family, gets its color from traces of iron; it is among the hardest stones, resulting in larger, flawlessly clear crystal formations. This new pendant, with a 43-carat cushion-cut aquamarine dangling from a 21-inch rope of diamond rondels, is impossible to miss — glinting audaciously even in starlight or the first blush of dawn. 2019 Tiffany Blue Book Collection, price on request, (800) 518-5555."

As we all sat on the terrace that warm July morning, enjoying our usual holiday breakfast of fresh croissants and jam, I barely stopped to think how this wonderful man at the head of the table had lived through more than we could imagine.

I was just moments away from making a discovery that would bring me face-to-face with not only his past but the lives of many of my ancestors."

He hooked the part with a little rubber suction cup on a rod, drew it safely out of the way, and inserted another piece, inhaling the exhaust of the Towmotors while standing on a skid to raise himself up to the level where other men stood."
