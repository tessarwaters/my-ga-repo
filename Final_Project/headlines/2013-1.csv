"Liberalism’s $400,000 Problem",2013-01-01,article,News,,[],What the fiscal cliff bargain means for the long-term liberal project.,"If the tax debate could be simplified to a liberal desire to make sure the tax burden is borne by those who can most easily afford it and a conservative desire to keep taxes as low as possible on as many people as possible, the fiscal-cliff bargain that was struck between Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden over the last 48 hours — a bargain that could still fail to pass the House, but probably won’t — seems to offer something credible to both sides. One the one hand, it includes a real Democratic concession, which substitutes a top income rate threshold of $400,000 for the $250,000 threshold that President Obama had long insisted on. But at the same time, for liberals seeking progressivity and fairness, that should be the easiest possible concession to make. The $400,000 threshold still puts the top bracket close to where it was under Bill Clinton when you adjust for inflation, and that Clintonian definition of “rich” wasn’t an implausible one: While the whining of the upper upper middle class (or, if you prefer, the not-that-rich rich) can be unseemly, there really is a big difference between a taxpayer making six figures annually and a taxpayer making seven or eight, and setting the top rate in the mid rather than low six figures is a way of acknowledging that the near-rich and super-rich do not occupy the same financial universe."

He created “Nutcracker!” in 1992, and, in 1995, “Swan Lake” which, as even nondance fans know, boasted a corps de ballet of virile male swans and enjoyed enormous international success. Mr. Bourne’s work remains extremely popular, particularly in Britain, where his company, New Adventures, has the kinds of lengthy runs and huge audiences more associated with Broadway than ballet. “Sleeping Beauty,” for example, opened Dec. 4 and runs through Jan. 26 at Sadler’s Wells, where Mr. Bourne is an associate artist. There are good reasons for Mr. Bourne’s success. He is a masterly storyteller. He is brilliant at finding a kernel of emotional truth in, and a fresh approach to, familiar dance narratives that make them resonate in new ways. And he has a collaborator of genius: Lez Brotherston, whose designs are both visually exciting and a vital part of the storytelling aspect of the productions."

Aki Sasamoto’s Lines of Reasoning,2013-01-03,article,News,,[],"The Japanese artist’s first solo exhibition in New York is now on view in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.","As Aki Sasamoto sees the world, an object is never merely its humble self. It may be, as the artist has written, her grandmother, who became a kimono belt after her death. Or her music teacher, who became a wig worn after chemotherapy. In other words, objects exist within a web of associations and relationships that are utterly personal, but also — at times — bewilderingly universal. Sasamoto, whose work was included in the 2010 Whitney Biennial, makes these connections visible through networks of cords and cables that demarcate lines across spaces and between repeated motifs like lemons and doughnuts. In her performances, she frequently wields a thick marker to draw whirlwind diagrams of coincidence or alliances, as if she were an unusually aggressive math teacher (the field in which she began her studies). The relentless pace of her narration is matched in her nimble and mercurial movements; her installations often act as room-size jungle gyms, from which she effortlessly folds, wraps or dangles her body, navigating around her audience."

A Populism Worthy of the Name,2013-01-04,article,News,,[],Erick Erickson’s new agenda and the future of right-wing populism.,"A big part of the story of the fiscal cliff negotiations, now half-resolved and half-postponed, was that the populist wing of the Republican Party couldn’t quite figure what it wanted to actually achieve, or how. The broad goals of less spending and lower taxes were clear enough, but on anything more specific the politicians and activists on the grassroots right seemed confused about what they thought the party should to be negotiating toward, or what they expected that their calls for harder hardball and/or cliff-diving would actually win in the end. (The scenarios being spun out tended to either envision extracting never-gonna-happen concessions from the Democrats across weeks of brand-destroying brinksmanship, or embracing a truly massive defeat on taxes as a “the worse, the better” step toward eventual conservative resurgence.) This confusion was obvious throughout, but particularly during the brief window on Tuesday when there was talk of House Republicans sending the bill back to the Senate with some amendments tacked on. If there had been any kind of strategically-plausible consensus about how conservatives actually wanted the compromise amended, then that gambit might have made some sense.

Martial Art,2013-01-04,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Poetry and Poets']","Combining various narrative styles, Royall Tyler translates a medieval Japanese saga of pride, romance and warfare.","Encountering Homer in a vivid translation made Keats feel like an astonished astronomer watching a new planet swim into view. Readers unfamiliar with medieval Japanese literature — and that must mean most of us — may feel a kindred excitement on first looking into “The Tale of the Heike,” in a taut new rendering by Royall Tyler. If “beauty and elegance,” as Tyler remarks, pervade the atmosphere of the earlier “Tale of Genji” (which he has also translated), the fall of the Heike warrior clan, during the late 12th century, calls to mind the riotous bloodletting of the “Iliad.” And just as Homer’s epic has inspired a thousand spinoffs, much of what draws us to Japanese culture — samurai and geisha, anime and manga, woodblock prints and Kurosawa films — comes right out of the exploits recounted in this book.

Into the Wilderness,2013-01-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Bernard Bailyn argues that the early settlers were a “mixed multitude” who created disparate American cultures.,"In theory, Bernard Bailyn should need no introduction. In actuality, the intellectual landscape is so fragmented that highly literate Americans may not know of this prolific Harvard historian, the recipient of two Pulitzers, a National Book Award, a National Humanities Medal and a Bancroft (the most important professional prize for American historians). Bailyn’s most influential work probably still is his “Ideological Origins of the American Revolution” (1967), which forever changed views of our nation’s beginnings. But my favorite is “The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson” (1974), a superb portrait of the last royal governor of Massachusetts, a conscientious but obtuse public servant whose inability to grasp his subjects’ resentments led to his becoming the most hated man in the colonies.

Jojo Moyes, the writer who produced this emotional typhoon, knows very well that “Me Before You” — a novel that has already floated high on Britain’s best-seller lists — is, as British critical consensus affirms, “a real weepy.” And yet, unlike other novels that have achieved their mood-melting powers through calculated infusions of treacle — Erich Segal’s “Love Story” comes immediately to mind — Moyes’s story provokes tears that are redemptive, the opposite of gratuitous. Some situations, she forces the reader to recognize, really are worth crying over."

Displaced Persons,2013-01-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Originally published in 1933, Hans Keilson’s autobiographical first novel paints a bleak picture of life in Weimar Germany.","“Life Goes On” is both a very good first novel and a chilling reminder of the Nazis’ success at destroying Germany’s rich literary culture for a generation, if not longer. The author, Hans Keilson, wrote this lightly fictionalized account of his life about 80 years ago, when he was in his early 20s. To give just one example of how much the world has changed since then: Keilson tells us in an afterword that the impetus to start the novel was the fury he felt after he’d been turned away as a patient by the powerful Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. (A few years later, the institute would be taken over by a cousin of Hermann Goering, and most of its analysts would flee to Palestine.) The publisher, the great S. Fischer Verlag, accepted the novel for publication in December 1932. The extremely poor and extremely elated Keilson took his advance and went skiing for the first time in his life. When he came back, the Reichstag was on fire, the Nazis had begun arresting Communists, and the publisher told Keilson to change his ending, which had a Communist twist. The novel appeared, with the altered ending, in 1933. It was banned in 1934. And that is the story, Keilson explains in the afterword, of “the last debut by a Jewish writer from the old S. Fischer Verlag.”"

Their teenage daughter keeps busy resenting her mother and fabricating outrageous abuse stories for an older, online boyfriend she’s never met.

The company already collects data to use in future sales campaigns, but parts of MyMagic+ will allow Disney to track guest behavior in minute detail for the first time."

A World Without Grand Bargains,2013-01-07,article,News,,[],What the near-impossibility of a major deal on entitlements and taxes should mean for Republican strategy.,"In my Sunday column defending John Boehner’s record as Speaker of the House, I make the point that for all the talk about how much more bipartisan and effective Congress used to be, there really isn’t a modern historical precedent for the kind of “everybody hurts” bargain on taxes and entitlements that would actually be required to bring our projected spending in line with our projected revenue. The most plausible recent example of such a bargain is the deal that George H.W. Bush struck with Congressional Democrats in 1990, which brought him so much grief and helped inspire a generation of Republican resistance to tax increases: That compromise promised to cut $500 billion from the deficit over five years, which (per my back-of-the-envelope adjustments for inflation) is the equivalent of about $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over ten years today. $2.5 trillion is a big number … but it’s only slightly more than the combined deficit reduction promised by last year’s debt-ceiling deal and this month’s tax increases combined — and that combination, of course, has only put a very modest dent in our long-term deficit problem."

Scott said that the film offers “fast cuts, off-kilter puns, sight gags and sound effects in such profusion that you may want to see it again as soon as it’s over.” He added: “At the end, the movie comes home to the well-known territory of the coming-of-age story, with an account of lessons learned and conflicts resolved. But you’ll swear you’ve never seen anything like it before.” "

Styron Visible,2013-01-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"William Styron’s letters, co-edited by his wife, offer a full portrait of the writer and the man.","“For a person whose sole burning ambition is to write — like myself — college is useless beyond the sophomore year,” William Styron wrote to his father in 1946, after returning from Platoon Commander School in Quantico, Va., to resume his studies at Duke. Styron would go on to graduate — he was a nice boy, and eager to please his doting father — but he wasn’t kidding about his monomaniacal focus on writing, and in many ways the early pages of this splendid book are the hardest. They are very earnest, albeit not in the Hemingway sense — that is to say, there’s nothing here about getting one’s leg nearly blown off in Italy or falling in love with one’s nurse or trout fishing in Michigan. In the young Styron’s case, it was all but entirely about the writing. Happily, his diligence soon bore fruit: by Page 21 his mentor at Duke, William Blackburn, has already brought Styron’s work to the attention of Hiram Haydn, the editor at Bobbs-Merrill who would eventually publish Styron’s first novel, “Lie Down in Darkness,” in 1951, when the author was only 26."

What’s On Friday,2013-01-11,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (TMC) MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) Michelle Williams, above, in an Oscar-nominated role, steps into the pumps and pencil skirts of Marilyn Monroe, and Eddie Redmayne plays Colin Clark, a documentary filmmaker who claimed to have spent an intimate interlude with her in 1956 while they were making “The Prince and the Showgirl.” This film, an adaptation of his diaries, also features Kenneth Branagh, in another nominated role, as Laurence Olivier, Monroe’s co-star and director, whose infatuation and ego clashes with Monroe caused him to call her “the stupidest, most self-indulgent little tart I’ve ever come across.” When the shoot went from bad to worse, he told her: “Just be sexy. Isn’t that what you do?” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, “He didn’t get Monroe, and she is similarly out of the grasp of this movie,” adding: “Ms. Williams tries her best, and sometimes that’s almost enough. She’s too thin for the role, more colorlessly complected than creamy, but she whispers and wobbles nicely.” Still, Ms. Dargis said: “The problem isn’t Ms. Williams or the serviceable work of the director, Simon Curtis, but a script by Adrian Hodges that hews faithfully to Clark’s clichés. Instead of the complex woman familiar from the better books about her, the film offers a catalog of Monroe stereotypes: child, woman, smiling exhibitionist, shrieking neurotic, the barefooted free spirit and, lamentably, the martyr teetering in heels toward her doom. The tragic Monroe is obviously dramatic, but the intimations of disaster don’t fit a movie that works so hard to be breezily, easily likable.” "

About 1,000 of the positions are hourly jobs brought back to Ford plants in the United States from other locations, including Japan and Mexico.  Ford said it was more than halfway to the 12,000 new jobs it committed to deliver in the United States by 2015 as part of its 2011 contract with the United Automobile Workers. “As we expand our product lineup of fuel-efficient vehicles, we need more people in critical areas, such as in a range of engineering activities, vehicle production, computer software and other I.T. functions, to ensure we deliver the vehicles people want and value,” Joseph R. Hinrichs, Ford’s president for the Americas, said in a news release. "

What’s On Saturday,2013-01-12,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Showtime) THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN — PART 1 (2011) Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) weds her vampire, Edward (Robert Pattinson, above, with Ms. Stewart), enjoys a rollicking honeymoon and then suffers through a horrendous pregnancy in this fourth installment in the franchise, directed by Bill Condon. Mr. Pattinson’s portrayal of a passionate, potentially dangerous husband capable of sexual rough play “shifts the story into another world,” said Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times. “Mr. Condon works in that world fluidly, gilding it with a necessary sense of humor — Bella and Edward’s white honeymoon bed glows as portentously as an altar for a sacrificial virgin — and imbuing it with a love and a gift for melodrama. He slathers on the music (‘melodrama’ comes from song or music drama), lets Ms. Stewart rock and the emotions roil. He resurrects the awkward teenage yearning that enlivened the first ‘Twilight’ movie, but also transforms that initial, crude hunger into something deeper. Mostly, he brings Bella toward her happily-ever-after by giving this movie over to her, her dreams and her desires, as in a cosmic montage sequence worthy of ‘The Tree of Life,’ but, you know, shorter. Edward may finally change Bella, but it’s Mr. Condon who resurrects her.”"

And “dulce de leche,” the Argentine milk caramel, first appeared in English in 1923 but was not more commonly used until a good 80 years later. These are just two of more than 2,000 words or terms crammed into this compact volume. There are some surprising gaps, like “acai,” the popular Amazonian berry; or “vadouvan,” a kind of curry that’s showing up on menus more often; or “guanciale,” the Italian cured pork cheeks. The perspective is more British than American, but what is offered is useful and fascinating. For example, who knew that there were not one but two terms for turtle meat: calipash and calipee, which refer to different parts of the animal? And that lamb’s wool was a warmed spiced beer with apple that Samuel Pepys mentioned as a nightcap in 1666?"

Sonia was taught to wait for a boil and then to wait five minutes more. The daily shots became her way of fending off conflict between her parents: Her father’s hands trembled because of his alcoholism, and her mother, a nurse who worked long hours, would get angry when she couldn’t rely on him. “The last thing I wanted was for them to fight about me,” Sotomayor relates in her new memoir. “It then dawned on me: If I needed to have these shots every day for the rest of my life, the only way I’d survive was to do it myself.” "

In September, archaeologists from the University of Leicester dug up a parking lot at the long-razed Grey­friars site and found, well preserved as if by a carefully wrapped shroud, the bones of a man whose skull had been hacked open and whose spine was curved, as Richard’s was said to have been.

Her most recent novel, “How Should a Person Be?,” is told from the perspective of Sheila, a young playwright eager to make art and attain fame, who is not to be confused with the author — at least not completely. For the Sheila of the novel, being famous is synonymous with being blessed. “In a religious context, you’re blessed because God watches over you, but in the secular context the biggest thing that could watch over you is everybody,” Heti explained. “She mistakenly imagines this ‘blessing’ will absolve her from being in difficult and painful relationships with others, and instead she can just kind of float along, untouched and beloved.”"
Louise Glück’s Metamorphoses,2013-01-18,article,Review,,"['Poetry and Poets', 'Books and Literature']",The relationship between poetry and mythology is central to Louise Glück’s “Poems 1962-2012.”,"Poetry has always been the handmaiden of ­mythology, and vice versa. Sometimes poets are in the business of collecting and tweaking existing myths, as with Ovid’s “Metamorphoses” and the Poetic Edda. Other times poetry applies a mythological glamour to stories and characters from history, legend or even other myths (the hero of the “Aeneid” is a minor character from the “Iliad”). Then there are poets who equate the idea of myth with the supposedly irrational essence of poetry itself. Here is Robert Graves in 1948: “No poet can hope to understand the nature of poetry unless he has had a vision of the Naked King crucified to the lopped oak, and watched the dancers, red-eyed from the acrid smoke of the sacrificial fires, . . . with a monotonous chant of ‘Kill! kill! kill!’ and ‘Blood! blood! blood!’ ” Which might sound more like a strip club picnic gone badly awry, but you get the idea."
Road Ready,2013-01-18,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Joyce Johnson explores Jack Kerouac’s heritage and early career.,"In January 1949, Jack Kerouac failed to appear for an afternoon date with a woman called Pauline. He had told Allen Ginsberg he planned to marry her — “the finest woman I’ll ever know” — once she had unshackled herself from her truck-driver husband, who, according to Joyce Johnson, was accustomed to “slapping her around to keep her in line.” In the meantime, Kerouac began an affair with Adele Morales (later to become the second Mrs. Norman Mailer). His failure to keep the rendezvous with Pauline, however, had nothing to do with affection for Adele; rather, he had overslept after a night of sex games with Luanne Henderson, whom Jack’s muse Neal Cassady had married when she was 15, and who, according to their friend Hal Chase, was “quite easy to get . . . into bed.” The tryst had been engineered by Cassady, who was hoping to watch, Johnson says, to show Luanne, by then 18, “how little she meant to him.” Two days later, Kerouac called on Ginsberg and found Luanne “covered with bruises from a beating Neal had given her.” Johnson describes Kerouac as “shocked” by the sight; nevertheless, “they all went out to hear bebop,” partly financed by money stolen by Cassady. In response to being jilted, Pauline confessed her affair to her husband, who tried to burn her on the stove. Kerouac described her in his journal as a “whore.” All the while, Ginsberg can be heard in the background: “How did we get here, angels?” "

That’s where Michael Connelly’s maverick, Harry Bosch, found himself after his ill-considered resignation from the Los Angeles Police Department. The same spirit of insubordination periodically lands a career detective like Jussi Adler-Olsen’s Carl Morck in some dead-end division like Department Q. And in the honorable tradition of the watch commander known as the Oracle in Joseph Wambaugh’s Hollywood Station procedurals, every veteran seems to feel duty-bound to take one last crack at an unsolved murder before he retires. Come to think of it, every active homicide assignment involving a longtime serial killer seems to lead to the cold case files. "

Jan. 20 — 26,2013-01-18,article,News,,[],A selection of culture events this week.,"THOUGH Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had many Broadway successes — “Oklahoma” and “South Pacific” among them — their 1957 musical version of “Cinderella” was made for television and, until now, has never been produced on Broadway. But “RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN’S CINDERELLA,” while promising to honor the soaring romance of the original, features a new book by the witty Douglas Carter Beane (“ Xanadu,” “Lysistrata Jones”) that includes some modern touches and, we can assume, a quirky twist or two. (The show’s Web site features the tag line “Glass slippers are so back.”) Laura Osnes (“Bonnie and Clyde”) plays the title role — Julie Andrews did the honors in the 1957 version — and Santino Fontana (“The Importance of Being Earnest”) will portray her rather neurotic prince. The rest of the company includes Harriet Harris as Cinderella’s stepmother and Victoria Clark as her fairy godmother, with Mark Brokaw (“The Lyons”) directing. Previews begin Friday.

New Yorkers Caught Checking Themselves Out,2013-01-18,article,News,,['Photography'],Busted by the two-way mirror.,"The passers-by who lingered to adjust a collar or smooth down unruly hair never knew that a photographer was on the other side of the two-way mirror, dressed in black clothes, a ski mask and gloves so his own reflection wouldn’t show up in the pictures he was taking. According to the photographer, Brad Farwell, the pedestrians he observed at four different Manhattan locations — the Bowery, Midtown, NoLIta and the Lower East Side — were much the same. But the time they spent looking at themselves differed, depending on the day. Sunday Downtown was a time for leisurely strolling and reflecting on what they saw in the mirror. On a weekday in Midtown, though, “the looks were the most unguarded, because they were so much quicker,” Farwell says. “The checking themselves out wasn’t about ego. It was more of an appraisal. They were sort of looking at themselves as they really were.”"

The Liberal Hour,2013-01-22,article,News,,[],Three reasons why an ascendant President Obama might not prove to be the “liberal Reagan.”,"I naturally preferred my own version of President Obama’s second inaugural to the speech he actually delivered yesterday, but the substance of the two was roughly similar. The president clearly feels that his re-election both reflects and ratifies a larger leftward shift in American politics: His address reached backward to ground this new progressive era in the American past, offered explicit nods to the demographic groups and constituencies whose present-day growth has made it possible, and then sketched out an agenda suited to a more left-of-center future — climate change legislation and green industrial policy, a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, the universalization of gay marriage, new gun control laws, etc. It was not a speech designed to co-opt opponents of this agenda, to put it mildly — particularly those opponents whose control of the House of Representatives will make this agenda difficult to implement. But those of us who watched his negative, joyless re-election campaign and assumed that this president would begin his second term as a lame duck were only half-right. While there’s still good reason to think that Obama’s biggest legislative accomplishments are in the rearview mirror, the fact that he could win a clean victory despite the grim economic backdrop seems to have given him more confidence in the staying power of his coalition, and the continuing short-term impediments to his agenda in Washington seem to have liberated him to play for the longer term instead."

My father was a religious leader in the community, and my sister is a pastor. I went to church every Sunday and sang in the choir. But for all that the church gave me — for all that it represented belonging, love and community — it also shut its doors to me as a gay person. That experience left me with the lifelong desire to explore the power of religion to transform lives or destroy them. I became interested in Uganda, an intensely religious country that attracts many American missionaries and much funding from United States faith-based organizations. The American evangelical movement in Africa does valuable work in helping the poor. But as you’ll see in this Op-Doc video, some of their efforts and money feed a dangerous ideology that seeks to demonize L.G.B.T. people and intensifies religious rhetoric until it results in violence. It is important for American congregations to hold their churches accountable for what their money does in Africa. "

Interaction designers by training and novices to the fashion world, the two have started a clothing label that essentially eliminates the need for the creative vision of one person. Instead, they’ve created software that puts that power in the hands of consumers, a process Huang calls “fashion design for the Instagram generation.” Shoppers logging on to constrvct.com can upload a photograph that will later be translated into a print, choose from a variety of basic silhouettes (the sheath dress is currently the most popular), then plug in their measurements. Three weeks later, a dress arrives in the mail, a time scale Huang estimate will be cut by two-thirds once the partners raise the funds to bring production in-house. Soon, pre-existing images will be available for selection, with royalties going to the artists who created them. And plans are afoot to add further customizing options like neckline, sleeve and hemline choices. “We don’t even need to make a pattern,” Huang says. “We can make the dress directly from the 3-D model. It’s basically you press the button, we make the dress. If we can do this at scale, it could change the way the whole industry works.”"

The Bristol Palin Effect vs. The Roe Effect,2013-01-24,article,News,,['ABORTION'],Weighing the pro-life movement’s role in the ongoing rise of out-of-wedlock births.,"Naomi Cahn and June Carbone, whose book “Red Families, Blue Families” I’ve written about favorably in the past, have a new piece for Slate making the case that the continuing rise in out-of-wedlock birth rates is an unintended consequence of the pro-life movement’s modest success at stigmatizing abortion. The piece starts by acknowledging a connection that social conservatives often have reason to point out: The biggest reason why blue states often have lower out-of-wedlock birth rates than more conservative states is that the blue states have higher abortion rates, and the relative stability of the “blue model” of post-sexual revolution family life — which is really the upper middle class blue model, in which serial monogamy in your late teens and twenties is followed by late marriage and parenting — depends on a “willingness to abort” as well as a facility with contraception. But where pro-life writers like myself tend to raise this point in order to cast doubt on the comforting-but-dubious idea that liberal policies will inevitably lower the abortion rate, Cahn and Carbone invoke it to cast doubt on the idea that one can simultaneously be opposed to abortion and in favor of stable two-parent families. After all, if a “willingness to abort” helps keep out-of-wedlock birth rates low among well-educated blue staters, then surely opposition to abortion can plausibly be held responsible for the steady rise in single parent households in the rest of the country — and especially in white, conservative-tilting middle America:"

The ostensible purpose of our trip was to fish the biggest remaining sockeye salmon run in the world and at the same time to make a case for opposing what would be the continent’s largest open-pit mine to be built atop said salmon run. But the more I tried to establish a narrative about this man, the more he broke up my effort with a kind of wilderness attention deficit disorder. No sooner had he hunched over to differentiate the identities of the shades of sage and white in the blooming tundra than he would hear the call of a ptarmigan. This in turn would lead to a discourse on the connection between migrations and snow melt and the desperation of grizzly bears in particularly snowy years.

The fund recently announced that it cut its operating expenses by 5 percent in 2012 while still making 26 percent more in grants than it did in 2011. Of the grants that had been audited, Dr. Dybul said, only 0.5 percent had been lost to fraud. The fund plans a new fund-raising round for later this year.

Spelling mistakes result in corporal punishment, and soon Edward, like a cruel Pygmalion, is telling Lee how to dress, answer the telephone and even eat. But his instructions help shape and direct her life — and his advances set her aflame. “Secretary,” directed by Steven Shainberg and adapted by Erin Cressida Wilson from a novella by Mary Gaitskill, could be seen “as a slap in the face to orthodox feminist thinking, since the concept of sexual harassment doesn’t seem to occur to anybody.” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “I prefer to see ‘Secretary’ as a wacky new-wave romantic comedy in which two lonely people locked inside their private fantasies discover a miraculous erotic harmony. In today’s post-Freudian, do-your-own-thing era of free sexual expression, the movie stands to be a wholesome self-help fable about the unlocking of shame and its magical transformation into pleasure and personal liberation. So what if its vision is finally too good to be true?”"

The result was the revolutionary Model T, a lightweight, durable and fast automobile that cost $850 at a time when the average car sold for more than $2,000. Soon the company was producing 1,000 cars a day. Taking its cue from the meatpacking industry, the company established the first automobile assembly line and controlled nearly half of the American car market. Ford, above with the Model T, also paid a $5 daily wage to reduce turnover, with strings attached. Immigrant workers had to attend the company’s English-language schools, and inspectors from the “sociological department” would delve into their private lives. As Ford became one of the richest men in the world, he found his hatred for the wealthy elite increasing; he allied himself with the common people. But as his ego expanded, so did his anger. Ford blamed Jews for the country’s problems, bullied those who worked for him and displayed withering cruelty toward his only son, Edsel, who died at 49 — a death many blamed on the unrelenting stress of trying to please his father."

Tune in To | Rachel Zeffira,2013-01-30,article,News,,['Music'],"The classically trained soprano has melded sacred music with a baroque pop sensibility on her debut solo album, “The Deserters.”","Rachel Zeffira is nothing if not a lateral thinker. When she was 17, a bureaucratic error nearly resulted in her deportation from Britain and caused her to lose her place at a music school in London. So Zeffira, who is from Canada, reinvented herself as a 26-year-old substitute French teacher (“a language I don’t speak”) and stayed in England until she raised enough money to continue her studies in Verona, Italy. Years later, when she and her bandmate from Cat’s Eyes, Faris Badwan (the frontman of the Horrors), were looking for a venue to play their first gig, she used the contacts she’d made in Italy to secure an appearance at a Vatican Mass attended by several cardinals. “I told them we were a choir,” she says. “They thought our backup singers looked a little too sexy. At the last minute we had to rush out and buy opaque tights and shawls.” In her latest example of creative adaptation, the classically trained soprano and multi-instrumentalist has melded sacred music with a baroque pop sensibility on her debut solo album, “The Deserters.” It was released late last year in Britain (the North American release, on Paper Bag Records, is scheduled for March) and is earning rave reviews, with the BBC memorably describing it as “tummy meltingly wonderful.” Dreamy, seductive and sparse, “The Deserters” has a quiet lushness that’s markedly different from the girl-group-tinged sound of Cat’s Eyes, though Zeffira hesitates to specify how. “I like to leave it to the listener to describe the music,” she says. “I don’t like it to be spelled out.”"

Judging by his interactions with Jürgen Habermas, among others, one might assume that the Pope stands for a political and theological conservatism quite at odds with Marxist tradition. Yet they, and indeed Benedict himself might be surprised to find that, as a post at First Things explains, he evidently has his admirers on the left. Four Italian “Ratzingerian Marxists” of the “Old Left” have issued a “manifesto” hoping to enlist the Pope in their fight against a “consumerist-inflected secularism.” Strange bedfellows? Maybe not, considering that a few close readers of Benedict’s 2007 encyclical “Spe Salvi” have noted that the Pope cites Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno to help refute the plausibility of the thesis that, with the waning of theistic belief, “man himself is now called to establish justice.”"

The houses can be ordered individually for $25, or as a set of eight for $150. Upon request, a hole will be drilled in each house to enable it to be hung. Information: etsy.com/shop/FryDay. "

Under the Microscope,2013-01-31,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Christoph Irmscher studies the contributions and contradictions of the pioneering scientist Louis Agassiz.,"During the California earthquake of 1906, the marble statue of Louis Agassiz toppled off the second story of Stanford University’s zoology building and plunged headfirst into the ground. The great scientist, with his head buried in concrete, his upturned body sticking up into air, became an iconic image of the earthquake. Agassiz is often remembered as a fallen man, Christoph Irmscher tells us. His rejection of Darwinian evolution and his conviction that America belonged to the whites only are an embarrassment to science. A decade ago, an eighth grader at the Agassiz School in Cambridge, Mass., came across a description of Agassiz’s racism and suggested the school change its name. It did, calling itself after the school’s first African-­American principal, Maria L. Baldwin. "
