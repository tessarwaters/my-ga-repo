"On Diversity in Publishing, a Young Star Warns: Get It Right",2017-07-07,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"Angie Thomas, whose debut novel, “The Hate U Give,” is No. 1 on the young adult list, has advice for authors writing about marginalized figures.","Representing: Angie Thomas’s first novel, “The Hate U Give,” about the police killing of an unarmed black teenager, has been a stalwart of the young adult hardcover list since its release late in February — it debuted at No. 1 and, after 18 weeks on the list, is back in the top position. Thomas’s book made news (including a front-page New York Times profile) partly for its topical story line and partly because Thomas herself, a 29-year-old from Jackson, Miss., is so cheerfully a symbol of change in the publishing industry. Mississippi “has a great literary history, but the other authors are dead or white,” she told her hometown newspaper in March. “As a kid, I would wonder, ‘Is this something that can happen to me, the little black girl from the hood?’” Now that it has, Thomas has become a literary ambassador of sorts, visiting classrooms and, last month, advising would-be authors at BuzzFeed how to represent traditionally underrepresented figures. One tip: Learn your stuff. “If you were writing a legal thriller but have no legal background,” she said, “would you do some research? So why not do the same when approaching marginalized characters? When I was writing ‘The Hate U Give,’ I had to research gangs. I have not been in a gang nor do I have family members who have been in gangs, so I had to research it. I had to look at firsthand accounts of that culture — not just what the media portrays. I watched documentaries and consulted with attorneys. This also applies to identity. If you’re writing about a gay boy or a black girl, you need to talk to a gay boy or black girl. You have to go above and beyond to get it right. The internet is a beautiful thing for a writer, but we have to put in the work. I think that’s key: Put in the work. Whether you’re writing about diversity or a legal thriller, you have to put in the work.” Still, Thomas has found some audiences more receptive than others — a fact that led her to young adult literature in the first place. “Not to throw shade or anything,” she told Cosmopolitan in March, “but I feel like teenagers are much more open-minded and willing to listen.”"

"‘Twin Peaks’ Season 3, Episode 9: Red, Beige and Blue",2017-07-10,article,Review,,['Television'],This week’s episode of “Twin Peaks” is the most plot-heavy one in a while.,"In the original run of “Twin Peaks,” Maj. Garland Briggs was a rare voice of optimism, in a show that usually depicted a world suffering from irreversible entropy. The Major’s son, Bobby, was a high-school delinquent who sold drugs, slept with a married woman and spent a long stretch of the series masterminding an ill-considered insurance scam. Yet in the Season 2 premiere, in one of the series’s most emotional moments, Garland moved his son to tears by describing a vision he had of his boy leading a happy, upstanding adult life. And sure enough, in “Twin Peaks: The Return” that dream seems pretty much fulfilled, with Bobby now serving as a trusted deputy in his town’s police department."

We thought we would have a couple orders every week.” The couple underestimated the demand for their custom suits, which cost about $1,700, and for their ready-to-wear models, priced at $1,350. Last summer, they moved their original shop into a larger space in Williamsburg, and in November, they opened a second location, in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. “We draw upon the old school,” Mr. Lewis said, “but we try to create an aesthetic that’s a littler more modern and clean and sharp.”"

A grandmother born in 1944, who made her name writing steamy tales of medieval Scotland and other historical domains, Garwood uses her social media accounts mostly for publicity and the occasional tweet cheering on her hometown Kansas City Chiefs or Royals. (She also demonstrates a fondness for silly jokes: “I hate those people who knock on your door and tell you how you need to be ‘saved’ or you’ll ‘burn,’” she posted a couple of years ago. “Stupid firemen.”) So when Garwood decided to feature a brilliant hacker as the heroine of her latest book, “Wired” — which hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 7 and traces the relationship between the hacker, Allison, and a raffish F.B.I. agent — she turned to more computer-savvy acquaintances. “To say I’m not an expert on hacking is an understatement,” she told me via email. “The more I read, the more I discovered there is no such thing as a little research. The subject is so vast and fascinating. I definitely wanted Allison’s skills to be in the realm of possibility, and so, when I was unsure about something, I checked with people who are knowledgeable about programming and the workings of the web.” But the goal was still to write a novel, not a users’ manual. “While hacking was the backdrop for the book,” she said, “I didn’t want it to be the primary focus. Too much technical information would bog down the story, which is about two people who, despite coming from very different worlds, are drawn to each other. Essentially, it’s a love story.”"
