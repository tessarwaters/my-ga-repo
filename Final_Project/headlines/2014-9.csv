Israel’s action on Sunday, Mr. Ban said in a statement, “risks paving the way for further settlement activity, which — as the United Nations has reiterated on many occasions — is illegal under international law and runs totally counter to the pursuit of a two-state solution.” Palestinians, who aspire to create a state on territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war, denounced the new land seizure by Israel and said it would further aggravate relations, less than a week after a cease-fire agreement brokered by Egypt was reached to halt 50 days of fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in Gaza. American and British officials also criticized the land seizing, calling it counterproductive, while Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said it would have “negative consequences on the peace process.” "

With names like Blue Velvet and Good Coffee — a “Twin Peaks” reference — Solomonov’s creations are an homage to the master of magical realist cinema. There’s one, though, that won’t see the light of day: the David Lynch. “I would have done a little clove and allspice, to get at the Indian-mystical thing, and a bit of malt powder since he used to have a daily milkshake,” Solomonov says. “Plus a healthy dose of windowpane LSD.” "

But what causes such fear and consternation is another feature of the ISIS regime: The public statements of the ISIS authorities make it clear that the principal task of state power is not the regulation of the welfare of the state’s population (health, the fight against hunger) — what really matters is religious life and the concern that all public life obey religious laws. This is why ISIS remains more or less indifferent toward humanitarian catastrophes within its domain — its motto is roughly “take care of religion and welfare will take care of itself.” Therein resides the gap that separates the notion of power practiced by ISIS from the modern Western notion of what Michel Foucault called “biopower,” which regulates life in order to guarantee general welfare: the ISIS caliphate totally rejects the notion of biopower."

Dangerous for Evil,2014-09-04,article,News,,[],Bad economic ideas as enablers of bad policy.,"“It is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.” So declared Keynes at the end of The General Theory; although I don’t think he appreciated the extent to which vested interests can buy the ideas they want to hear.

When the editors of Time Out Dubai enumerated their “Top 10 Books” about — and set in — Dubai, they came up with, among others, the following: “Carte Blanche,” a James Bond novel by Jeffery Deaver; Ben Mezrich’s “get-rich-quick story” “Rigged”; and Candace Havens’s “Charmed and Dangerous: Bronwyn the Witch No. 1.” Of that last, the venerable travel guide remarks: “This chick-friendly romance by U.S. resident Havens takes an adventurous turn when Bronwyn, a 25-year-old witch from Texas, accepts a job with the British prime minister and finds herself traveling to Dubai, where she meets a sheikh who insists she accept the use of his private jet.” You get the picture.

The Big Sweep,2014-09-04,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Police officers and criminals are hard to tell apart in James Ellroy’s novel of 1940s Los Angeles.,"Few writers, once established in the public consciousness, have changed their style as drastically as James Ellroy. In his early days, Ellroy wandered through the boneyards of 1980s pulp, channeling Jim Thompson and Dashiell Hammett before he found his own voice with a trilogy of contemporary novels about a troubled, racist genius cop named Lloyd Hopkins. Hopkins was morally despicable in the day-to-day, but compared with the monsters he fought in the neon-drench of underworld Los Angeles, he was quasi-­angelic. When Ellroy closed out the Hopkins trilogy with “Suicide Hill” in 1986, he shuttered his interest in topical culture as well and moved into the second incarnation of his career, that of the wildly romantic yet increasingly bilious chronicler of Los Angeles in the years immediately following World War II."
SS-­Obersturmbannführer (Retired),2014-09-04,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Holocaust and the Nazi Era']","In his years in Argentina, Adolf Eichmann remained a convinced Nazi, proud of his wartime achievements.","Ever since his capture in the early 1960s, Otto Adolf Eichmann, who was in charge of Jewish affairs during the Third Reich, has been the subject of unsettled and passionate controversy — centered, above all, on Hannah Arendt’s portrait of him at his 1961 trial. Her “Eichmann in Jerusalem” in many ways mirrored Eichmann’s own self-presentation. She insisted that, contrary to expectations, the man in the dock was not some kind of demonic Nazi sadist but a thoughtless, relatively anonymous, nonideological bureaucrat dutifully executing orders for the emigration, deportation and murder of European Jewry. Arendt’s insights — that genocide and bureaucratic banality are not necessarily opposed, that fanatical anti-Semitism (or for that matter, any ideological predisposition) is not a sufficient precondition for mass murder — remain pertinent."

Those winking lights, bobbing along the ground and filling up the night sky with their impossible density, signal an alternate reality to the artificially haloed urban evening I’m accustomed to in the San Francisco Bay Area. In this little corner of the Adirondack Mountains, other signals — cellphone, for one, or car headlights — are spotty, or altogether absent. Much of modern life is filtered out through the dense trees and mountains on the winding approach to Lake George. What remains — a place to run around in the woods — is time-tested and true."

At Democratic clubs and other forums, the governor has avoided taking on his opponents, and, on Thursday, Ms. Teachout debated Rob Astorino, the Republican nominee, on WNYC — also minus the governor.

What’s on TV Friday,2014-09-05,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) SAVING MR. BANKS (2013) Tom Hanks stars as Walt Disney in this Disney movie about the making of a Disney movie: specifically “Mary Poppins,” which, at the time of its creation in the early ’60s, was the most expensive live-action film the studio had produced. Eventually it became one of the most beloved, too, and one of the biggest moneymakers. Emma Thompson (above, with Mr. Hanks) is the author P. L. Travers, who conjured the magical nanny, and is something of a crank. “I won’t have her turned into one of your silly cartoons,” she says of her creation, stiffly, lips pursed. There’s a back story too, in which Travers is a little girl (Annie Rose Buckley) in a dusty town in Australia, where her hopelessly alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) can barely hold on to his bank job. “Fans of the book and the earlier movie will know that Mr. Banks is the father of the children cared for by Mary Poppins, but even those entirely innocent of her previous literary and cinematic incarnations — if such people exist — will find this movie accessible and enjoyable,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this movie directed by John Lee Hancock. “That is part of the Disney brand, of course: fun for everyone, with a spoonful of therapeutic medicine to help the sugar seem nutritious.” "

Inside the List,2014-09-05,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"With Ebola back in the news, readers are returning to Richard Preston’s scientific adventure story “The Hot Zone,” which is No. 17 on the paperback nonfiction list.","Going Viral: Twenty years ago, Richard Preston scored a nonfiction hit with his scientific adventure story “The Hot Zone,” about an outbreak of Ebola virus among quarantined monkeys in Virginia — the book spent almost two years on the hardcover and paperback lists before fading away in June 1996. (That was a good time for science journalism. During its run, Preston’s book shared space on the list with Oliver Sacks’s collection of neurological case studies “An Anthropologist on Mars” and Nicholas Negroponte’s technology primer “Being Digital,” which predicted the end of fax machines and CD-ROMs.) Now, with Ebola back in the news because of its fatal spread through West Africa, readers are returning to “The Hot Zone.” The Associated Press reported last month that Anchor Books, the paperback publisher, had printed 70,000 new copies, and the book is currently at No. 17 in its 50th week on the paperback nonfiction list. “The thing is,” Preston told CNN early in August, “Ebola has been pulling surprises on all of us. I don’t think anybody really expected that Ebola had the potential to do something like get into the cities and get out of control. But, you know, most of the experts I’m talking to are saying that they are pretty well convinced that, you know, they will be able to get it under control, but there’s huge concern about the possibility that Ebola could get into a major city.” The virus’s return is obviously bad news. But it does retroactively absolve “The Hot Zone” of a charge Colin Harrison leveled against it in the Book Review a few years after its publication. “The outbreak in Virginia resulted in exactly zero human cases,” Harrison noted, complaining about the “happy frenzy” of media attention the story had received. “It was the first time that everyone knew about a disease that nobody had. It was the first time that a virus was famous for being famous.” Now we know we were right to panic."

Ferrante’s view of family life is anything but sentimental, anything but comforting. "
Future Footprints,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Diane Ackerman surveys the technology and innovations that define our human-dominated epoch.,"For the first time in history, a sentient species, Homo sapiens, has become a force of such magnitude that our impacts are being written into the fossil record. We have decisively changed the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the rate of extinction. We have created ­new atomic isotopes and plastiglomerates that may persist for millions of years. We have built mega­cities that will leave a durable footprint long after they have vanished. We have altered the pH of the oceans and have moved so many life-forms around the globe — inadvertently and ­intentionally — that we are creating novel ecosystems everywhere. Since the late-18th-century industrialization that marks the Anthropocene’s beginnings, humans have ­shaken Earth’s life systems with a profundity that the paleontologist Anthony Barnosky has likened to an asteroid strike.

Girlhood Gone,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Sex and cruelty are tools a 14-year-old uses to cope with a devastatingly irresponsible father in 1970s Greenwich Village.,"It seems endemic to the enterprise that fiction writers must fall good and hard for their characters — how else could we stand to live with them for weeks, months, years, in sometimes tortuous isolation? As in marriage or a long affair, this abiding attraction can twist and turn into revulsion or obsession. It can also wax and wane. The writer can stray and then beg for forgiveness, banging on a shut door to be let back inside. In conjuring “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” Mark Twain became captivated by Huckleberry Finn, Tom’s “idle and lawless and vulgar and bad” sidekick, so much so that Twain rode Huck on to glory with his subsequent masterpiece. J. D. Salinger’s beloved Holden Caulfield appeared in several stories, both published and unpublished, before he found his home in “The Catcher in the Rye.” And, as any fan knows, Salinger had a hell of a time kicking the Glass family to the curb; its members own or make appearances in all three of Salinger’s story collections, as well as in new collections (fingers crossed) that are rumored to be ­forthcoming. "
Impossible Mirrors,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A Brooklyn-based narrator preoccupied with identity decides to help his best friend have a child.,"Early in “10:04,” Ben Lerner’s frequently brilliant second novel, the central character — a refraction or avatar of this ­Brooklyn-based author — describes visiting the Metropolitan Museum with a female friend: “We often visited weekday afternoons, since Alex was unemployed, and I, a writer.” Together they look at a melodramatic 19th-century genre painting of Joan of Arc, which the narrator claims is one of his favorite pictures. Lerner uses the strikingly unlovely word “coconstructed” to describe the shared nature of their experience: “We would work out our views as we coconstructed the literal view before us.” A few paragraphs on, he and an 8-year-old boy are seen “coconstructing a shoe-box diorama.” Later he can be found letting an Occupy protester shower in his apartment, wondering if it’s possible to “coconstruct a world in which moments can be something other than the elements of profit.”"
His Manifest Destiny,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A fictional memoir narrated by Estebanico, a Moroccan slave and the first black explorer of America.","In 1527, the Castilian conquistador Pánfilo de Narváez and a crew of 600 men sailed from Spain to the Gulf Coast of the United States to claim “La Florida” for the Spanish crown. Laila Lalami recounts the voyage — and its brutal aftermath — in her new novel, “The Moor’s Account,” from the perspective of Estebanico, a ­Moroccan slave of one of the explorers. It’s a fictional memoir, told in a controlled voice that feels at once historical and contemporary, that seeks to offer a truer account of the expedition than the official (and hopelessly biased) version of events provided by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, one of the other three survivors.

Toxic Relationships,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A small town falters after an industrial disaster.,"A sinister oily sludge — improperly buried toxic waste reasserting itself — has wormed its way out of the ground in a small Texas town. Birth defects and cancer rates have soared; houses have been abandoned and razed. Now, years later, a peculiar collective amnesia has set in, and only one woman is still fighting the City Council, which has cleared the land for redevelopment, and the predictably sleazy real estate magnate who will profit from the job.

The nonfiction shelves already abound with gastro-exposés (hello, Michael Pollan, Marion Nestle and Michael Moss), so why not fiction?"
Hour of the Wolf,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Grief and cold dominate this novel set in remote Alaska.,"Early in William Giraldi’s fierce, extraordinary new novel, “Hold the Dark,” the nature writer Russell Core tracks a pack of wolves deep into the Alaskan tundra. The wolves, it seems, have been taking children from a nearby village, and Core, a wolf expert, has been summoned by the latest victim’s mother to “get her boy’s bones and maybe slaughter the wolf that took him.”"
Minority Report,2014-09-05,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Asian-Americans']",A journalist examines Asian-American manhood and the cultural stereotypes that shaped his coming-of-age.,"There’s nothing subtle or coy or particularly evocative about the title of “Big Little Man: In Search of My Asian Self,” a memoir by the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Alex Tizon. In fact, the title is so straightforward that when I was asked to write this review, I felt vaguely offended by the idea that my editor would push such an obvious identity-politics project on me, perhaps believing that I, by dint of being “Asian-American,” must therefore have some special insight into Tizon and this search for his Asian self. I am 20 years younger than Tizon and grew up in snooty college towns and attended schools where I was taught that there was a hierarchy of race writing. The immigrant experience was not enough in itself, and when I read the self-evident title of Tizon’s book, I flashed back to a fiction workshop in ­Columbia’s M.F.A. program and a ­professor who told me that the book I was working on — a book much like Tizon’s — could “definitely be published,” but wondered if there was anything I could do to elevate it into something more “interesting.” I recognized the code immediately — anything labeled “the immigrant experience” would be considered earnest and déclassé, and would therefore need to be gussied up in fashionable literary frills. For the next year, I wrote bad evocations of Lydia Davis, Lorrie Moore, Barthelme and Borges. My protagonists, God help them, became whiter and whiter. "
Dubliners,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A series of challenges unsettles an extended family’s comfortable existence.,"We spend our lives tumbling through time, carried along as it eddies and pools, buckles and loops, stutters and flies. As T. S. Eliot put it in the opening lines of “Burnt Norton,” “Time present and time past / Are both perhaps present in time future, / And time future contained in time past.” We like to think that time is ours to waste, but it is we who pass through time, wasting only ourselves."
The Age of Hobsbawm,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"This collection of reviews and lectures, posthumously published, mourns the end of European high culture.","A 1980 television film written by the British director Stephen Poliakoff depicted an interminable train journey through Europe, in which a young Englishman is trapped in a cramped compartment with a pompous Viennese matron, played by Peggy Ashcroft. The woman is rude and vain, but the film, “Caught on a Train,” refuses to despise her: Instead it recognizes that she is an elderly ambassador for a world that is about to pass away, the lost civilization of prewar Europe."
Art of Murder,2014-09-05,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Louise Penny’s “The Long Way Home,” Chief Inspector Armand Gamache follows a lost artist’s perilous journey to find himself.","Sooner or later, every writer of small-town mysteries must confront the occupational hazard of running out of murderers and victims. Louise Penny, who sets her enchanting stories in a sheltered Quebec village she calls Three Pines, keeps inventing new ways to avoid the inevitable reckoning. In THE LONG WAY HOME (Minotaur, $27.99), she makes the task more challenging by putting her detective out to pasture. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache has retired from the Sûreté du Québec to live a contemplative life, enjoying the company of his eccentric neighbors and hoping to be anointed with the “balm in Gilead” that will “make the wounded whole” and “cure a sin-sick soul.” Gamache is moved by the plight of one neighbor, Clara Morrow, a painter whose husband, Peter, left home when her artistic reputation eclipsed his own — promising to return in exactly one year, presumably after intense soul-searching. But that anniversary has come and gone without any word, and Clara is afraid Peter’s in terrible trouble, might even be dead. Clutching at a few meager clues, the most intriguing being some atrocious paintings Peter sent to his sister’s child, Gamache and Clara follow the lost artist’s perilous journey to find himself."

But there are still interesting things to talk about, and I’ll start in with the movie that’s supposed to be the great exception to the current doldrums — “Love Is Strange,” in which John Lithgow and Alfred Molina play longtime companions who tie the knot, only to have Molina’s character lose his job as a music teacher at a Catholic school because the bishop found out about his nuptials, which forces them to sell their tastefully shabby New York apartment and crash (separately, miserably) with their relatives while they try to get on the list for a rent-controlled living situation, with various uncomfortable interpersonal consequences for everyone concerned."

What’s on TV Saturday,2014-09-06,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) 12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) In this Oscar winner for best picture, written by John Ridley and directed by Steve McQueen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, above, portrays Solomon Northup, a free African-American man who, in 1841, was kidnapped in Washington and sold into slavery. Paul Giamatti plays the brutish Louisiana trader who sells Solomon to William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a seemingly decent plantation owner, who in turn sells him to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) a drunken madman, who epitomizes the villainy of slave ownership. Lupita Nyong’o won a best supporting actress Oscar for her turn as Patsey, Epp’s favorite, whom he brutalizes. “Mr. McQueen’s sympathies are as unqualified as his control,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “There is much to admire about ‘12 Years a Slave,’ including the cleareyed, unsentimental quality of its images — this is a place where trees hang with beautiful moss and black bodies — and how Mr. Ejiofor’s restrained, open, translucent performance works as a ballast, something to cling onto, especially during the frenzies of violence.” And while these scenes are hard to watch, “the genius of ‘12 Years a Slave’ is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price.” "

To finish, he secured hair with a simple black tie at the nape. “I can’t really move my neck too much!” joked the model Mari of the ultra-sleek result.

1914: French Press Misjudges U.S. Ambassadors,2014-09-07,article,News,,"['Diplomatic Service, Embassies and Consulates', 'United States International Relations']",The local press speculated about postings at the American Embassy in Paris in 1914.,"Judging from their comments, some of the French newspapers take a rather erroneous view of the arrival in Paris of Mr. W. G. Sharp and Mr. Robert Bacon. The idea seems to prevail that the United States is now represented in Paris by a sort of diplomatic triumvirate. Such an idea, of course, is amusingly inaccurate. Mr. Myron T. Herrick, the American Ambassador, is in sole charge of the Embassy, and will remain in sole charge until the end of the existing crisis. Mr. W. G. Sharp, who will take over the Embassy when conditions permit Mr. Herrick to retire, is in Paris for the purpose of arranging details connected with the preparations for his residence here. As regards Mr. Bacon, who made a host of friends during his term as Ambassador, he is visiting Paris at this time on private business. The French press, in fact, in trying to read diplomatic significance into the presence in Paris of the three eminent diplomatists, is wasting its ingenuity. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 8, 1914"

How to Get the Purple Hazy Eyes at Derek Lam,2014-09-07,article,News,,"['Cosmetics and Toiletries', 'Fashion and Apparel', 'New York Fashion Week']","For the designer’s spring/summer 2015 runway, the French makeup artist Tom Pecheux perfected natural violet eye makeup with layers of “bruisey” colors.","“I like when beauty has a little twist to it,” said the French makeup artist Tom Pecheux backstage this morning. When workshopping the concept behind the beauty look at Derek Lam, Pecheux tried a few different options for the designer. “The first was all natural, no makeup, blah blah,” he said. “The girl looked like a flat wheel. So I said, ‘Let’s try a nude color,’ which was pretty but boring.” Eventually the face painter grabbed a rich violet color and smudged it over the lids: et voilà, that did the trick. “Derek said, ‘Oooh, I like that!’ ” exclaimed Pecheux, with an amused smile. Still, the “bruisey” shade, as Pecheux described it, required careful application. To avoid the illusion of being punched in the face, he traced MAC Fluidline in Deep Deep Brown along the upper lashes, then brushed on MAC Lipstick in Violetta, creating a soft pinky-lavender wash over the lids and up to the brows. “The lipstick is bright, so you only need a thin layer,” he insisted. To finish, he swept on a metallic taupe eye shadow, then etched a thin streak of white kohl pencil under the eyes to lend contrast. The last step: sheering out everything with his hands. “This is your best friend,” Pecheux said, waving his finger in the air. “Using your fingers with makeup brings so much sensuality and femininity to the face, and that’s what I want for spring and summer.” "

It is typically translated from Latin as “force of the county.” Anyone who has ever watched an old Western movie will instantly recognize the first word as referring to men deputized by the sheriff to chase down some varmints who went thataway. (Rappers and their tag-alongs later gave “posse” a different context.) The full phrase is more obscure, but the concept that it embraces is enshrined in American law. The Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878 at the end of Reconstruction and amended but slightly over the decades, prohibits the nation’s armed forces from being used as a police force within the United States. Soldiers, the reasoning goes, exist to fight wars. Chasing local wrongdoers is a job for cops."

Set in Las Vegas; Los Angeles; and Palm Springs, Calif., the film chronicles the men’s relationship, as Liberace has Mr. Thorson cosmetically altered in his image and legally adopts him before discarding him for a younger model. “There’s something uncanny, even brilliant,” about Mr. Douglas’s impersonation of Liberace, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “Sashaying across Las Vegas stages and epic suburban living rooms with a drum major’s puffed-up grandeur and a lounge lizard’s predatory smile, Mr. Douglas gives a performance so assured, so free of camp or cringe, that you quickly surrender any doubts you might have had about his playing a famously flamboyant, closeted-in-plain-sight gay entertainer.” Still, “a cerebral gloss on, and satire of, a big old Hollywood biopic,” Mr. Hale added, the film is “full of smart, funny details — perfectly sewn in place, like the rhinestones on one of Mr. Douglas’s blinding costumes — but it’s short on heart, or heat.”  "

Global Warning,2014-09-11,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Francis Fukuyama chronicles international political history to define liberal democracy and discover how and why it develops.,"In 1989, Francis Fukuyama published an essay in The National Interest entitled “The End of History?” that thrust him into the center of public debate. Although often misunderstood and maligned, its central argument was straightforward and sensible: With the collapse of Communism, liberal democracy stood alone as the only form of government compatible with socio­-economic modernity. Over the years since, Fukuyama has continued to argue the case, and has now summed up his efforts with a two-­volume magnum opus that chronicles global political development from prehistory to the present. A quarter-century on, he remains convinced that no other political system is viable in the long run, but concludes his survey with a sobering twist: Liberal democracy’s future is cloudy, but that is because of its own internal problems, not competition from any external opponent."

Mr. Yousef, whose memoir, “Son of Hamas,” inspired the film, wasn’t a Palestinian fighter infused with jihadist fervor.

I can see very clearly what each dancer is doing. It’s a way to sketch. It’s an information generator.” Last month, Harrell, who divides his year between the United States and Europe, drifted amid islands in a Berlin rehearsal space. He gave the dancers directions that ranged from the blunt — “stop doing that” — to the fanciful — “move with the smell of fashion.” This session was practice for “Practice,” a not-quite-performance that Harrell was preparing to give in New York at the Museum of Modern Art, in which he would invite spectators to spy on his creative methods. “It’s a nightmare in many ways,” he says, “because I’m very private about my process.”"

Crowds gathered when she appeared in the streets of Paris. Newspapers reported her outfit changes. Royalty asked to meet her. Traditional beauty is rarely so exciting, but hers was unorthodox: She had a long neck, a big nose and skin so uncannily white that people argued over whether it was real or fake. Theories included that she covered her entire body with makeup or strategically dosed herself with arsenic. In an era of puffy, body-swallowing gowns, she wore snug dresses that showed off her curves; she put red makeup on the tips of her ears, just for extra drama. She was rumored to be sleeping with half the men in Paris. Every painter wanted to paint her, to be the great hero who fixed her image for a culture desperate to stare at it. But art — the translation of three-dimensional life into a flat, static illusion — was an act of magic with serious consequences. In a time before mass-produced cameras, an image was a heavy thing, laborious to make and hard to distribute. Instagram was Duragram. Amélie always refused."

Inside the List,2014-09-12,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"“The Secret Place,” by Tana French, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4, just after the critic Laura Miller recently argued that women write the best crime novels.","Unsolved Mysteries: Do women write the best crime novels? That’s the thesis of a recent essay in Salon by the critic Laura Miller, who argues that mysteries by men have grown sclerotic and predictable — locked into a hard-boiled formula little changed since the days of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Meanwhile (Miller continues), women are mixing their crime stories with other genres, mining the emotional terrains of home and family to advance a field the editor Sarah Weinman calls “domestic suspense.” One novel that features prominently in Miller’s analysis is “The Secret Place,” by Tana French, which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. “A thin vein of the uncanny runs through most of French’s novels,” Miller notes: “mysteries that go unsolved, premises that flirt with impossibility, paranormal occurrences that may or may not be imagined.” I don’t know if Miller is right about men and women; who is? But she’s not wrong about French, whose books really do cultivate an appealing lack of resolution — at least in part, no doubt, because she jumps in without a plan. “When I start writing, I have the narrator, the basic premise and a load of coffee,” French told The Sunday Times of London in 2008. “I don’t even know ­‘whodunit.’ ” Not that she would let uncertainty keep her from a genre she loves. “Crime fiction is one of the best barometers of what’s going on at any different moment,” she added. “It’s about society’s highest priorities and deepest fears.”"

True Detective,2014-09-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Hercule Poirot reappears, courtesy of Sophie Hannah, years after solving his “last case.”","Nobody would dispute the fact that Hercule Poirot, the elegant Belgian detective, he of the patent-leather shoes and the waxed mustache, is dead. Agatha Christie brought him to an end in her appropriately named novel, “Curtain: Poirot’s Last Case,” and The New York Times itself marked his death with a fictional obituary. But the demise of the hero, and of the author, no longer needs to be the end of the story. The literary executors of James Bond’s creator, Ian Fleming, have held this view for some years, and there seems to be no end to the public’s enthusiasm for rewritten versions of a whole host of literary favorites."
The Body’s Temple,2014-09-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this Ian McEwan novel, a judge must decide the case of a teenage Jehovah’s Witness who refuses treatment for leukemia.","When Anne Darwin died just after her 10th birthday in 1851, her father “lost the joy of the Household.” No longer could he see “as plainly as others do, and as I should wish to do, evidence of design and beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world.” Charles Darwin’s faith was gone; he began writing “On the Origin of Species.” As Ian McEwan has told interviewers, “rather like Darwin when his favorite daughter died,” on Sept. 11 he “felt, more than ever,” that there was no God, and that “religion was distinctly unhelpful in making compassionate, reasonable judgments about people’s lives. On the whole, the secular mind seems far superior in making reasonable judgments.” In McEwan’s early novels, intelligent characters had often “slithered” along the “axis of belief and unbelief,” just as he had. Not anymore. Atheism and the secular state are under attack, and he must defend them."

Or, depending on your perspective, the Gilded Age of Plunderers. From Lord Elgin’s marbles to Alfred Russel Wallace’s tropical fauna (over 80,000 beetles!) to Edward Drinker Cope’s dinosaur bones to Charles Frederick Newcombe’s Northwest Coast totem poles, it was the unquestioned privilege of the enlightened world to amass the specimens and relics of the dark one, and to study, paint or display them in cabinets and museums — or sell them.

VanderMeer carefully grounds us in that region’s ecology: the palmettos, the black damselflies and the “wealth of birdlife, from warblers and flickers to cormorants and black ibis.” But he also immerses us in its everyday human life: bowling alleys, dive bars, mobile homes.

Worth Its Weight,2014-09-12,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Gold Standard (Monetary)', 'Economic Conditions and Trends']",A historian examines the rise of the gold standard and the economies that have embraced and abandoned it.,"If you said that a principal cause of the 2008 financial crisis was an explosion in credit, most economic commentators would nod their heads in agreement. If you then said this credit boom was due to lax monetary policy, you’d still earn a healthy fraction of nods. If you then asserted that America’s departure from the gold standard caused the lax monetary policy, not many folks would be nodding. Nevertheless, this attenuated causal chain has been embraced by a motley collection of wonks, cranks and presidential candidates: Michele Bachmann, Glenn Beck, Steve Forbes, David Stockman and politicians whose last name is Paul. These gold bugs have a deep suspicion of fiat currency. They fret that governments that can just print money will be tempted to print even more, triggering inflation, currency depreciation and worse. Most citizens do not share this obsession, but they might share an unease about the dollar being backed by nothing more than a social convention to treat greenbacks as if they are worth more than the paper they are printed on."

(HBO) DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013) A fiercely gaunt Matthew McConaughey, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician and rodeo rider who, after learning in 1985 that he is H.I.V. -positive, decides to treat himself by hunting down medication not then legal in the United States. Eventually, he begins a subscription service, selling contraband medicines for a monthly fee. Jared Leto (above left, with Mr. McConaughey), in another Oscar-winning performance, plays the transgendered Rayon, who becomes Ron’s business partner. And Jennifer Garner is the doctor who, after initially opposing the plan, turns into an ally. What is largely missing from this drama, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and inspired by real events, “is the sense that Ron’s efforts are part of a larger movement,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Ron’s bravery and determination are entirely credible, thanks to Mr. McConaughey’s disciplined, high-spirited performance and the filmmakers’ interest in the complexity of the character.

The British government will donate 1.5 million pounds ($2.44 million) to the Royal Shakespeare Company to translate all of Shakespeare’s works into that language for the first time. The grant, announced by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, will finance a company tour of China in 2016 and allow for select Chinese dramatic works to be translated into English. In bringing Shakespeare’s canon of plays to readers, directors and actors in China, the government hopes to forge “stronger links with China,” according to a statement by Sajid Javid, the British culture secretary. “Sharing the very best of our respective cultures is a brilliant way to make this happen,” he said. The translations continue a Shakespeare-centered cultural exchange between the two nations: In 2012, China’s National Theater performed for the first time at the Globe Theater in London, putting on “Richard III” in Mandarin. The British government will donate an additional £300,000, or about $488,000, to support exchanges between China and the British Museum.

Obama wants to strike against ISIS in a part of Syria that is currently outside the authority of the Syrian government, which the president has accused of war crimes, and is thus, in our eyes, a legal no-man’s land.

She then used Burberry’s New Eyebrows (out in October) to sculpt arches. “Not only is the color amazing, you can create a shadow rather than a solid block of color,” she said. “It’s completely foolproof and doesn’t look drawn on; it’s not heavy, it’s more sophisticated.” The models’ skin, meanwhile, positively glowed under an insect- and flower-printed, greenhouse-like tent. Rowe first treated the face with Fresh Glow Luminous Fluid Base in Golden Radiance before highlighting the cheeks. “The Golden Radiance works on any skin tone and you can’t see it,” she explained. “It just gives you a lift of a tan, which we want for summer.” For lips, Burberry’s Lip Definer in Brick Red was treated with a dusting of Fresh Glow Powder for a matte finish. “Yes, the red lip can, of course, look classic,” Rowe added. “But we want to keep it modern — that’s why we kept the eyes nude and the skin slightly darker.”"

Across the pond, one of the suites at the Beaumont in London — set to launch this fall in the Mayfair district as the first hotel from the restaurateurs behind the Wolseley and Brasserie Zédel — has been designed by Antony Gormley as a three-level “inhabitable sculpture.” Featuring fumed-oak interiors, the conjoined cubes of stainless steel mimic the British artist’s own body, a recurring theme in his work. Next spring, Living Architecture plans to unveil “A House for Essex” in the U.K., designed by the Turner Prize winner Grayson Perry in collaboration with the architecture firm FAT. With its ceramic-tile facade and aluminum roof sculptures, not to mention the handmade tapestries and artworks inspired by a fictional local character, it looks like something out of a fairy tale. "

U.S. Steel’s Canada Subsidiary Files for Creditor Protection,2014-09-17,article,Brief,,[],The Canadian company has posted an operating loss of $2.4 billion over the last five years.,"U.S. Steel Canada was granted creditor protection on Tuesday, the latest chapter in its tumultuous recent history. U.S. Steel said that the Canadian company, known as Stelco before its purchase in 2007, has posted an operating loss of $2.4 billion over the last five years. With the filing, the Canadian unit’s results will no longer be included in U.S. Steel’s financial statements. In 2009, U.S. Steel shut down the Canadian operation and locked out its workers while demanding pension changes. That prompted a lawsuit from the government of Canada, charging that the company had failed to live up to foreign investment laws. An agreement to make further investments in Canada ended that action, although the company continues to battle unions. A lawyer for U.S. Steel Canada told the Ontario Superior Court that it had liabilities of between 3.86 billion and 4.3 billion Canadian dollars ($3.52 billion and $3.9 billion), and assets worth between 1.9 billion and 2.3 billion Canadian dollars, according to The Globe and Mail. The largest creditor is U.S. Steel, which the court was told is owed 1.6 billion Canadian dollars. It will provide the subsidiary with up to 185 million Canadian dollars to keep it operating until the end of 2015. "

Following a revolt at the Skoda works, the Gestapo made hundreds of arrests. In many cases, families of arrested workers received a few days later the papers of the member of their family arrested and a primed notice warning them that they were not to wear mourning or to speak of the death. It is believed probable that the Gestapo carried out executions at Prague, in the basement of the Petchek Bank. Other executions have been reported from Brno, where a revolt has been suppressed. Rudolf Beran, former Premier, has been arrested. A number of executions have taken place at Zilina, in Slovakia, without the Slovak authorities being advised. To their inquiry the Gestapo replied that it was ‘‘obliged to take all measures of prudence necessary to prevent acts directed against the German Army.’’— New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 20, 1939"

If they want arms, ‘‘we are ready to discuss the question in a brotherly fashion and give our help,’’ he said. Mr. Khrushchev told the youth forum delegates: ‘‘I did not look at hydrogen or atomic bombs, but I saw an assortment of weapons used for infantry, artillery, tanks and rockets. I saw them and I said: ‘See what man has built for man. It’s terrible.’’’ In his 45-minute extemporaneous speech, Mr. Khrushchev gave his third clarification of his remarks last week about Soviet weaponry.

Constance, the protagonist of the first, has become a fantasy novelist in the decades since their relationship ended (she calls herself C. W. Starr, in the tradition of J. K. Rowling and P. D. James), famous for an invented world called Alphinland that she claims Gavin never understood: “It was a dangerous place, and — granted — preposterous in some ways, but it was not sordid.

While the Roman Empire ­collapsed into the vernacular across the European continent, monks in the cold stone ­monasteries of that cold stone island hand-copied ­Latin and Greek versions of Scripture. Their “manuscripts” revived ­antiquity’s systems of notation, resurrecting spaces between words and pauses between thoughts, and turned the Flesh of body text into the Word of divine ­revelation through the sacrament of quotation. The first thing God says to the first man, Adam, is, Don’t pick the fruit from a certain tree.

Inside the List,2014-09-19,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Ian McEwan, whose novel “The Children Act” is No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list, keeps a tally on his website of academic dissertations and theses discussing his work.","Ijan Makjuan: The British novelist Ian McEwan — whose latest book, “The Children Act,” hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 4 — keeps a tally on his website of academic dissertations and theses discussing his work. There are dozens of them, as befits a writer of McEwan’s stature, and their titles should give even unversed readers a fair sense of his interests (as well as the interests of literary scholars today): “Pervasive Perspectives: Gender Relationships in the Fiction of Ian McEwan”; “The Child in Time: Postmodern Representations of Childhood in the Novels of Ian McEwan”; “A Mind With a View: Cognitive Science, Neuroscience and Contemporary Literature”; “The Epistemology of Evil in Ian McEwan’s Novels.” Sex, childhood, postmodernism, science, the nature of evil: Yep, that’s ­McEwan. (The paper about evil was written by a Serbian philosopher, Zorica Djergovic-Joksimovic, who later expanded her research into a book with the wonderful title “Ijan Makjuan: Polifonija Zla,” or “Ian McEwan: The Polyphony of Evil.”) McEwan recently told The Wall Street Journal that fans sometimes stop him in the street. “But literary fame is quite delightful compared to Hollywood fame or rock ’n’ roll fame or footballer fame,” he said, “because the kind of people who like literary fiction tend to come up blushing or squirming with embarrassment, trying to make themselves disappear but just wanting to tell you before they fade away that your work has meant a great deal to them. And then they vanish before you can even say thank you.”"

She Wears the Britches,2014-09-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Disguised as a man, Laird Hunt’s heroine joins the Union Army.","How do you solve a problem like Ash Thompson? The heroine of “Neverhome,” Laird Hunt’s enthralling new novel set during the Civil War, is at once sentimental and aloof, a savior and a killer, a folk hero who shuns her own legend, a fierce and wounded woman who finds strength in her troubled past. Above all she is a liar, but one whose every word has the sheen of truth. “I was strong and he was not,” she begins her tale, “so it was me went to war to defend the Republic.” Yet it becomes clear that Ash is hardly motivated by patriotism, and that an equally devastating war awaits her return home."

Secret Histories,2014-09-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Students at a therapeutic boarding school discover a way to return to the past, before their personal traumas.","Early in Meg Wolitzer’s acclaimed novel “The Interestings,” two boys at summer camp indulge in unlikely late-night mischief when, by the glow of their flashlights, they sneak passages of “All the President’s Men.” Wolitzer’s characters are often wildly bookish. In her first novel, “Sleepwalking,” three “death girls” worship Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton and another, invented, suicidal poet; in “The Uncoupling” sex lives are undone by a high school production of “Lysistrata”; and in “The Wife,” the heroine marries her college creative writing professor. In “Belzhar,” her second novel for young readers — after the ingenious “The Fingertips of Duncan Dorfman,” a middle-grade book — Wolitzer tells a flashlight-worthy story that illuminates some dark corners of adolescent desire."
Rare Bird,2014-09-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this middle-grade novel, a girl finds a way forward after the loss of her mother.","A book called “Nest” with a main character called Chirp might seem almost too cute. But Esther Ehrlich’s debut middle-grade novel is anything but saccharine; in fact, its ambition is to be rigorously realistic about tragedy in a child’s life. That so grave a work would festoon itself with whimsy speaks to the book’s virtues and its potential limitations. This is a book to take seriously, that has a lot to say. But is it for the child readers it’s targeting?"

Under a bright sun and cloudless sky, before a crowd of 250,000, the most decorated ­African-American combat unit to serve in World War I marched under the newly erected Victory Arch at 23rd Street and up Fifth Avenue. White observers were awed by the spectacle of some 3,000 black soldiers in French helmets, bayonets gleaming, parading in disciplined lock step formation, while black residents flooded the streets and cheered wildly, welcoming home their loved ones and heroes. Capped by this extraordinary moment, the 369th was etched in history as the Harlem Hellfighters."

Return of the Bums on Welfare,2014-09-20,article,News,,[],Attributing unemployment to benefits that don’t exist anymore.,"Thinking some more about John Boehner’s resurrection of the notion that we’re suffering weak job growth because people are living the good life on government benefits, and don’t want to work. It has long seemed to me that the issue of unemployment benefits is where the debate over economic policy in a depression reaches its purest essence. If you’r on the right, you believe — you more or less have to believe — that unemployment benefits hurt job creation, because you’re “paying people not to work.” To admit that depression conditions are different, that the economy is suffering from an overall lack of demand and that putting money into the pockets of people likely to spend it would increase employment, would mean admitting that the free market sometimes fails badly. And of course disdain for the unemployed helps a lot if you want to oppose any kind of aid for the unfortunate."

What’s On TV Sunday,2014-09-21,article,Schedule,,[],What’s On TV Sunday,"8:30 P.M. (CBS) MADAM SECRETARY Téa Leoni stars as Elizabeth McCord, a college professor and former C.I.A. analyst turned newly appointed secretary of state, who battles office politics and circumvents protocol as she navigates issues in the White House and abroad. Then there are matters with her husband and two children at home. Tim Daly plays her supportive spouse; Bebe Neuwirth is her chief of staff; Geoffrey Arend is her speechwriter; Keith Carradine is the president, and her former mentor; and Zeljko Ivanek (above left, with Mr. Carradine and Ms. Leoni) is his Dick Cheney-esque chief of staff. “Hillary Rodham Clinton is the obvious inspiration, but this is Hillary with a human face: Téa Leoni, who has a husky voice and a loose, engaging manner, is an unusually likable beauty,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “As Elizabeth McCord, she has all the brains and determination of the original and none of the political ambition and baggage.” Ms. Stanley added that a closer model for Mrs. Clinton can be found in the character of Alicia Florrick, the wife of a politician brought down by a sex scandal in “The Good Wife.” That show’s sixth season begins at 9:30, with Alicia refusing to run for state’s attorney. “She stands by his side for a while, then leaves him and restarts her legal career from scratch,” Ms. Stanley said. Of the two series, “ ‘The Good Wife’ stands out because it strikes the right balance of network-mandated virtue and cable-inspired vice. ‘Madam Secretary’ has some good moments, but it would be better if its heroine were just a little bit worse.” "

Mellon Foundation will contribute $750,000 to Gibney Dance to support its Dance in Process residency program, bolstering an impressive fund-raising year for the organization, which operates a dance company, two dance centers and a community action program for victims of domestic abuse. In January, the Agnes Varis Trust announced a $3 million gift that allowed Gibney Dance to take over and renovate a 36,000-square-foot space at 280 Broadway, next to City Hall, that Dance New Amsterdam relinquished when it declared bankruptcy a year ago. Over three years, the Mellon gift will provide 30 artists with a three-week residency at Gibney’s other Manhattan space, 890 Broadway in the Flatiron district, where the company has been based since its founding in 1991. In 2011 the company significantly expanded its footprint in the building with additional studios; with the Mellon grant, it is establishing a choreographic center there. The Dance in Process program has been in pilot mode for the past two years with virtually no financial backing. “The Mellon support will give it real depth and will really ground it,” Gina Gibney, the chief executive and artistic director of Gibney Dance, said in an interview. “We will be able to support these dance artists at a whole new level.” The residency will focus specifically on midcareer artists, a demographic often left out of major funding support in favor of so-called established or emerging artists."

The company said it was pulling out of the country entirely and would sell its assets. It has three factories, about 450 employees and annual sales of about $77 million in Venezuela. Clorox, which is based in California, said in a statement that for nearly three years it had to sell more than two-thirds of its products at prices fixed by the government, even as high inflation caused its costs to rise sharply. It said recent price increases “were nowhere near sufficient.” Clorox sells bleach and other household cleaning products in Venezuela. Venezuela suffers from inflation of more than 60 percent a year and shortages of many basic goods, a situation that could be exacerbated by Clorox’s exit.

And in the case of the British photographer and T contributor David Sims and the hairstylist Guido Palau, early collaborations proved to be the spark that ignited their careers. Both hail from similar backgrounds, having grown up around “not sophisticated London,” as Palau describes it, listening to a lot of David Bowie, punk and New Wave music. They formed an easy friendship in the mid ’80s and soon teamed up behind the lens, building a portfolio of test pictures that would define their respective styles: Sims would often cast lanky kids off the street, letting them do whatever they felt like in front of the camera, while Palau created “non-hair” that was usually messy, unwashed and always offhandedly cool. The look was a precursor to grunge and quickly caught the attention of Calvin Klein, who hired the duo to shoot his CK campaign featuring Kate Moss in 1993. It was a pivotal moment for Sims and Palau, yet neither realized it at the time. “I didn’t think even for a minute we’d end up making anything like a living from it,” says Sims. “Or be successful,” adds Palau."

She grew up to be a suffragist and a president of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., wrote plays and poetry, and built a theater that seated 150 on her property in Bellport, N.Y. But it was the doll house collages that impressed Eric Boman when he saw an exhibition about Ms. Edey’s life at the Bellport-Brookhaven Historical Society. Mr. Boman, a photographer and writer, turned the artwork into a book, “The Paper Doll’s House of Miss Sarah Elizabeth Birdsall Otis, Aged Twelve,” which will be published next month (Thames & Hudson, $30). If Mrs. Edey had followed the path suggested by her dream home, she might have become an interior designer whose style was elegant, playful and scaled for drama. But why did she choose collage as her mode of expression? “Girls would draw and paint a doll’s house,” Mr. Boman said, “but this girl, I think, she didn’t think her handiwork was up to snuff.” Information: thamesandhudsonusa.com."

Revisiting the Original Classics of Surf Cinema,2014-09-25,article,News,,[],The reissue arm of the boutique Brooklyn record label Mexican Summer is releasing the soundtracks to the cult ’70s films “Crystal Voyage” and “Morning of the Earth.”,"Surfing is back in a big way, and with it, a renewed interest in artifacts from the original heyday of surf culture.

Both films featured exhilarating camerawork (by the surfer George Greenough, also responsible for inventing the modern surfboard fin), heady but mellow psych-rock soundtracks and an underlying message about the sanctity of nature. This month, the boutique imprint Anthology Recordings, part of the influential Mexican Summer label, reissues these two rare film soundtracks on heavyweight wax. And tonight, the label is screening a rare archival print of “Morning of the Earth” at Anthology Film Archives in New York (no relation to the record label).

Sandwiched between the music of Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne on the car radio was a promising new voice whose sound fit right in with theirs.

Allan Tresser) performed in the Catskills, he would display a pasteboard panel boasting of his television credits: As seen on “The Jack Paar Show”! And “Wonderama”! And ... well, I forget the rest, but not the idea: The king’s prime was decades past. And the billing presumed a similar vintage for his listeners as they prepared to obey whatever Simon Says — or doesn’t. But if Mr. Tresser had long since peaked, hadn’t the Fallsview Hotel of Ellenville, N.Y., in which he was resident tummler, also seen far better years? And the Nevele? And Kutsher’s? The last was celebrated in an elegiac 2012 documentary, “Welcome to Kutsher’s: The Last Catskills Resort,” which is being updated in December with a final section chronicling the hotel’s demolition to make way for a yoga retreat. In the 1980s, when films like “Dirty Dancing” or “Sweet Lorraine” were set in such hotels, they were already relics from another era. "

Rather, it looks at the year he went from discovery to detonation. It happened fast: In 1966, Hendrix — played with dreamy reserve here by André Benjamin, a.k.a. André 3000 of Outkast — was a cool cat who was calling himself Jimmy James and playing with Curtis Knight and the Squires, an R&B band.

During his four-plus decades working for Braun, many of which he also spent creating furniture for the British company Vitsoe, the German designer, 82, made a staggering number of stripped-down home goods and gadgets, many of which are as relevant now as the day they were conceived. Case in point: The same modular 606 Universal Shelving System bought in 1960 can still be seamlessly added to today and is as coveted by design aficionados as ever. But it is his ability to both inspire and confound successors like Jasper Morrison and Apple’s Jonathan Ive — spurred on by his prophetic principles of good design — that may be his greatest legacy. Describing Rams’s humble CSV 12 amplifier rotary switch in the foreword to the book “Dieter Rams: As Little Design as Possible,” Ive writes, “It could not be better, simpler, clearer or more beautiful.” In other words, less, but so much more."

Ticking Time Bomb,2014-09-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An attack in Karachi reveals a web of lives connected by violence in this novel-in-stories.,"Among people who routinely deal with violence, pain, cruelty and injustice — ­domestic violence counselors, aid ­workers, paramedics, public defenders, immigrant advocates — there’s a phenomenon known as secondary trauma. It’s also sometimes called vicarious trauma, or empathic strain. In her book, “Trauma Stewardship,” Laura van Dernoot ­Lipsky, a former social worker, defines it as being unable to live with the knowledge that, despite our best efforts, most of the world’s suffering goes “unnoticed and unattended.” “Still,” she writes, “people who are working to help those who suffer . . . must somehow reconcile their own joy — the authentic wonder and delight in life — with the irrefutable fact of suffering in the world.” "

In her panic, she recites the Buddhist sutras “preaching unattachment, impermanence, the inevitability of death,” an unholy trinity that could apply to all civil wars. This chilling exchange reminded me of a conversation I once had on a London bus with a Somali refugee, who swerved from banal chitchat into dark reminiscence. He recalled a moment in Mogadishu when he was forced to recite his genealogy, the string of grandfathers’ names that place all Somalis within their clans, and he borrowed a school friend’s lineage, as his own would have marked him for death.

Inside the List,2014-09-26,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Caitlin Doughty, whose “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” is No. 14 on the hardcover nonfiction list, is a young undertaker who has made it her mission to demystify death and promote a D.I.Y. approach to funerals.","The Dead: Nonfiction books usually rely on fairly pedestrian titles and subtitles to tell readers what’s inside — see for instance “The Roosevelts: An Intimate History,” by Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns, No. 6 in its second week on the hardcover nonfiction list. But every now and then a book arrives that reminds you naming can be an art in itself; the best subtitles work almost like line breaks in poetry, forcing you to re-evaluate what came before. So let’s pause a moment to appreciate Caitlin Doughty’s “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” new at No. 14, which has the sit-up-and-take-notice subtitle “And Other Lessons From the Crematory.” Doughty is a young undertaker from Los Angeles who has made it her mission to demystify death, encouraging customers and the public at large to embrace a D.I.Y. approach to funerals. “They are grossed out,” she told The Atlantic in a recent online interview, “but that’s because they’ve been told their whole lives that death and bodies are best kept to the ‘professionals’ and that they are dangerous. Most corpses are safer than living bodies. Corpses don’t decompose immediately. They’re not a time bomb of deadness waiting to attack. They’re your mom or your husband, or the shell of them, at least. . . . Your average corpse is completely safe.” I’m not sure how soothing I find this pep talk — it’s not putrefaction I fear, it’s death — but I do admire Doughty’s cheerful sang-froid. I bet she’s excellent at her job."

Forster, this novel traces a struggle for liberation both on and off the page.","The term “literary historical fiction” might be used for noncommercial novels set in the past and full of thoughtful allegorical implication. Or one could employ it for a highly specific subgenre, that portion of “fictional biography” consisting of novels about real-life writers. This territory seems to be expanding of late, with Colm Toibin’s re-creation of Henry James (“The Master”), Jay Parini’s incarnation of Melville (“The Passages of H. M.”) and David Lodge’s imagining of H. G. Wells’s energetic sex and writing lives (“A Man of Parts”)."

1914: British Take Orange River,2014-09-26,article,News,,['World War I (1914-18)'],Highlights from the International Herald Tribune archives: British forces fight German troops in South Africa in 1914.,"CAPE TOWN — The important strategic position of Raman’s Drift, on the Orange River, has been occupied by British forces. The attack was made at daybreak. The Wachtmeister made a gallant attempt to hold the blockhouse commanding the Drift after his men had evacuated it, but he eventually surrendered. The patrol was then despatched up river. The Germans were discovered in a position from which they were dislodged after a smart skirmish and they retired. The South African force lost one killed, one wounded and two horses killed. The patrol then fell back. Regimental Sergeant-Major Thomas, of the 5th Regiment, behaved with the greatest gallantry, picking up a wounded rifleman and removing him out of danger while under heavy fire. Subsequent scouting disclosed the fact that an important grazing and watering station some miles within the border was held by the enemy. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 27, 1914 "

Attacked in front and on their flank, the German troops retired in disorder toward Assche, leaving in our hands many prisoners and wounded as well as several caissons. To-day, apparently with the intention of avenging this defeat, Malines was bombarded by long-distance guns and important forces made a general movement along our front. Between Malines and Alost the several German attacks against us failed. Toward Alost, our division of cavalry succeeded in taking the German left wing in the rear. In short, the German attack has failed and our troops have without difficulty preserved the positions acquired from Antwerp to Malines. There, however, the station has suffered severely. Many houses have collapsed, others are on fire. A dozen civilians have been killed.’’ — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 29, 1914"
