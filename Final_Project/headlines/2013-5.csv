Seafood is an obvious choice, but there is a long list of cheeses that would work well. Satiny, funky Torta del Casar and rich Mahón come to mind, though there are many other options from beyond Spain. Perhaps cheese with asparagus; these wines, with their persistent citric notes and occasional herbal allure, easily tame that springtime wine challenger. I chose asparagus barely cooked, to dress pasta in pastel green. I kept the tips whole and used the stems to make a finely ground pestolike mixture with garlic, olive oil and cheese, this time Grana Padano. Asparagus done this way also could enrich a risotto, fill an omelet or garnish a fillet of salmon."

Anyone who has watched “American Idol” for more than a few seconds this season knows that their feud is no ratings-boosting prank; contempt of this magnitude can’t be faked. When Minaj raves over a finalist, Carey winces; when Carey coos, Minaj rolls her eyes. The two divas dared to address each other directly a few weeks ago, but their talk quickly devolved into interruptions and condescension. Producers may have recruited these two in the hope that an occasional good-natured spat would reignite the spark that went out when Simon Cowell exited the show three years ago. As it turns out, Minaj and Carey trade harmless barbs about as well as North and South Korea."

Significant Others,2013-05-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Claire Messud’s latest novel depicts a thwarted artist bewitched by a boy and his parents.,"Reading the title of Claire Messud’s latest novel, anyone of a literary turn of mind will immediately think of the madwoman in the attic, the 19th century’s best-known “woman upstairs.” In “Jane Eyre,” Bertha Mason was the first wife of the master of Thornfield Hall, who shut her away and, in so doing, opened the door to more than a hundred years of impassioned feminist criticism. This connection is entirely intentional, as Messud quickly makes plain. “We’re not the madwomen in the attic,” argues her “reliable,” “organized” protagonist, a teacher named Nora Eldridge, referring to unmarried women like herself, “numerous” in their 20s and 30s, “positively legion” in their 40s and 50s. “We’re the quiet woman at the end of the third-floor hallway, whose trash is always tidy, who smiles brightly in the stairwell.” Outwardly they may seem “benignant” (to use a Brontëan word), but inwardly, Nora declares, they seethe. “People don’t want to worry about the Woman Upstairs,” she reflects. “Not a soul registers that we are furious. We’re completely invisible.” In time, she will resolve to “use that invisibility, to make it burn.”"

In the same spirit, “A Guide to Being Born,” by Ramona Ausubel, the author of “No One Is Here Except All of Us,” deals with the desolation and surreptitious thrills that come to us through ownership of a body and its accompanying life. Or ownership of a life and its accompanying body: these tales allow the body to adjust as needed.

His work appears in permanent collections at the Tate Modern and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and has been exhibited extensively throughout Europe and Asia.

But, strange as it may seem for such an unflinching observer of the criminal justice system, until now Perry hadn’t trained her exacting eye on the subject of rape.

Blakey Vermeule, the author of “Why Do We Care About Literary Characters?,” answers her title’s question this way: “We use them to sort out basic moral problems or to practice new emotional situations. . . . We use them in place of statistics as tools.” Reading Peter Dimock’s second novel, “George Anderson: Notes for a Love Song in Imperial Time,” didn’t automatically make me a better person — but it did make me aware that, as an American, I should try to be one, even if my attempts are probably doomed."
Cracked,2013-05-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A mysterious Fabergé egg encodes secrets at the heart of Danielle Trussoni’s second tale of evil fallen angels..,"Angels do in fact walk among us, and they are not at all to be trifled with. Or at least that’s the alarming state of affairs at the heart of Danielle Trussoni’s 2010 best-selling novel, “Angelology.” Called Nephilim, these angels — or, more properly, angel-human hybrids — are the descendants of traitorous, fallen rebel angels. No haloed guardians, these: they want nothing less than dominion over mankind. Set against them are the angelologists, a secret global group dedicated to thwarting the Nephilim’s unholy ambitions. Readers flocked to Trussoni’s first novel (she’s also the author of a 2006 memoir, “Falling Through the Earth”) for its mix of fantasy and religious conspiracy, as well as for the improbable romance between its characters: the art historian Verlaine and Evangeline, an innocent young nun."
Face Value,2013-05-03,article,Review,,"['Watches and Clocks', 'Books and Literature']","In early-20th-century America, two powerful men were engaged in a contest to possess the world’s most remarkable watch.","Because our species evolved in stressful environments, the drive to grapple with scarcity is deeply embedded in our psychology. Severe and chronic shortages can of course wear people down. But just as the development of a sound immune system requires exposure to lots of microbes, sound mental health seems to require the challenges presented by moderate amounts of privation. An old cartoon by Gahan Wilson captures the idea. Two middle-aged angels, newly arrived in heaven, are playing harps while perched on a cloud. One, his face a mask of dismay, asks the other, “You mean this goes on forever?”"

What’s on Saturday,2013-05-04,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Showtime) SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN (2012) The director Lasse Hallstrom transforms Paul Torday’s absurdist political satire — the tale of a visionary sheik (Amr Waked, above left, with Ewan McGregor) with unlimited financial resources intent on creating a recreational paradise for fishermen in a Middle Eastern desert — into a whimsical romantic comedy. Mr. Hallstrom “is a shrewd commercial alchemist with a soft heart,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, and the result “is the cinematic equivalent of turning salt into sugar.” Mr. McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones, a British fisheries expert who is approached to evaluate the feasibility of the concept, which would involve either importing 10,000 North Atlantic salmon to Yemen from Britain, or using farmed salmon. Kristin Scott Thomas is Patricia Maxwell, the press secretary for the British prime minister, who seizes on the opportunity to distract the public from political conflicts and score points for her boss. And Emily Blunt is Harriet, the sheik’s assistant, and the unspoken object of Fred’s affection, whose soldier boyfriend (Tom Mison) has gone missing in action. “Whether Harriet and Fred will get together is a question that hovers over the movie,” Mr. Holden said. “The appeal of the film depends on the charm of Mr. McGregor and Ms. Blunt, whose polite but discreetly charged connection is the story’s emotional center.” And although the sheik is the target of an assassination plot by Islamic extremists, “the biggest moment of suspense has nothing to do with international politics or terrorism,” Mr. Holden said. “It comes when those farmed salmon are finally released into the waters of their new home. Will they mill around in confusion or will they jump? It is enough to say that for this moment to be the film’s dramatic turning point is an indication of its softness.”"

Sweet and Spicy or Assertive Wines With Eggplant,2013-05-07,article,News,,"['Eggplants', 'Wines']",Eggplant’s tendency toward bitterness makes it a difficult pairing.,"Eggplant is often described as a polarizing food, one that people either love or hate. I’m the counterexample. I like it well enough, unless it’s overcooked, which emphasizes the mushy texture and slight bitterness that seem to repel so many. That tendency toward bitterness, especially when combined with the spinach in Mary McCartney’s dish of eggplant wraps, makes it a difficult pairing. I think of reds first, but nothing too tannic, which would clash with the bitterness. The sweet and spicy fruit of a lighter-weight zinfandel would work well. So might a lively Sicilian red like a nero d’Avola or a cerasuolo di Vittoria. Assertive whites would work well, too, like a sauvignon blanc, even a flamboyantly styled example, or a good, dry chenin blanc, like a Vouvray or Savennières."

ZANUCK (2013) Laurent Bouzereau chronicles the life of Richard D. Zanuck (1934-2012), the Oscar-winning producer, through recollections of his childhood on the 20th Century Fox lot as the son of the studio head Darryl F. Zanuck and his wife, the actress Virginia Fox. When Richard had the chance to produce his first film, “Compulsion,” starring Orson Welles, he said his father told him: “You know I had it a lot easier than you will have it. You have to overcome the circumstances of your birth. You carry baggage with you — I am the baggage you carry.” When Darryl Zanuck was installed as chairman of the studio in the 1960s, he asked his son for a list of possible names to be appointed president of the company.

Gin Doesn’t Make You Sad,2013-05-10,article,News,,"['Gin (Liquor)', 'ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES']",It’s just the opposite. Blame William Hogarth for the bad rap.,"Few spirits bear so heavy a semiotic burden as gin, which is regarded by many as mother’s ruin, the destroyer, the devil, the drink that shall not be named. More often than not, when I try to nudge wary customers gently toward gin (instead of, you know, vodka), they look at me as if I’ve offered them a live grenade. This bad rap, I think, is partly the fault of the English artist William Hogarth. The gin of 18th-century England — harsh and cheap — is very different from what we drink now, but anyone who was shown a slide of Hogarth’s “Gin Lane” in history class is unlikely to forget the images of those dissolute Londoners: here, a man fighting a dog for a bone; there, a woman dropping her baby over a railing."

Years ago, I saw a young patient with headaches, who disclosed — reluctantly — that he had committed a serious crime and that somebody else took the fall for it. I believe he was telling me the truth (his headaches soon resolved after the confession). Before his admission, I assured him that whatever he told me would not leave the room. Later, without giving specifics, I consulted our hospital lawyer, who told me that we were under no obligation to report the incident, because the patient wasn’t in danger of hurting himself or others. But the future of an innocent man hinges on two people’s consciences, my patient’s and my own. I feel like a coward, hiding behind the Hippocratic oath, doing nothing. NAME WITHHELD"

Who Made That Digital Camouflage?,2013-05-10,article,News,,"['United States Defense and Military Forces', 'Camouflage', 'Inventions and Patents']",From suitcase-size splotches of green and brown to a “Harry Potter” cloak.,"“I was basically designated the weird-projects officer,” says Timothy O’Neill, who worked with an Army team to improve the camouflage painted on tanks in the early 1970s. At the time, the military covered its vehicles with suitcase-size splotches of green and brown. The pattern could trick the eye at a distance, but it didn’t work well at close range. O’Neill set out to find a better solution. At the Aberdeen Proving Ground, a test site in Maryland, he and his team put an armored personnel carrier out in a field and painted it with two-inch squares in woodland colors. From far away, the flecks seemed to coalesce into a large pattern, so that the vehicle blended with the trees behind it. The tiny squares also mimicked close-up details: individual leaves, tufts of grass and shadows on a branch. O’Neill’s tests showed that this digital camouflage — as it would later be called — fooled the eye into seeing tank and landscape as one."

I listened to it compulsively, like an addict, blasting music into my head and causing major damage to my ears. As mind-blowingly wonderful as it is to now carry 25,000 songs in my pocket, the Walkman forced a deeper engagement with the music you loved. Nobody carried around lots of cassettes. Maybe one or two extra. And if you were like me, you often kept the same one in there for weeks at a time, creating an intimacy that seems quaint now. Fast-forwarding and rewinding were a drag, so you tended to listen through entire albums, sometimes falling in love with songs you hated on first listen. This was commitment. The melodies and lyrics on these albums in particular — “Hatful of Hollow,” by the Smiths; “Murmur,” by R.E.M.; “Let It Be,” by the Replacements; “Head on the Door,” by the Cure; and “Architecture & Morality,” by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark — are practically etched on the inside of my skull."

Hundreds of thousands of men are digging the gigantic equilateral triangle with which Sanford Thayer intends to send a signal to his fellow astronomers on the red planet. Once finished, each side will consist of a paved trench more than 300 miles long and exactly one seventy-third of Earth’s circumference. The trenches, five miles wide, are deep enough to be filled with a 12-inch layer of petroleum that will flow from 309 taps connected to a pipeline. The huge black triangle set against the white desert sand will prove the existence of terrestrial intelligence to the Martians, Thayer argues, because the equal-sided triangle is part of the two planets’ “shared knowledge of trigonometry.” The equilateral triangle is, he believes, the “basis for all human art and construction.”"

Spectral Souls,2013-05-10,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A collection of short stories by the Russian writer Nikolai Leskov, a contemporary of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy.","Over the past century, the Russian writer Nikolai Leskov (1831-95) has been repeatedly rediscovered. As Richard Pevear points out in the introduction to “The Enchanted Wanderer” — a collection of 17 stories vibrantly translated by Pevear and Larissa ­Volokhonsky — this has happened at least three times. The first rediscovery took place during Leskov’s own lifetime: in the 1880s, after he had suffered for years “an almost total critical neglect,”the young Chekhov hailed his oeuvre, declaring him “a mixture of an elegant Frenchman and a defrocked priest.” Leskov, Chekhov continued, “was considerable.”In the 1920s, the formalist critic Boris Eikhenbaum discerned Leskov’s influence in the work of such diverse writers as Andrei Bely, Isaac Babel and Maxim Gorky, who frankly “declared himself Leskov’s disciple.”And again, at the hands of critics like Walter Benjamin and Irving Howe, Leskov was the subject of yet another revival. “To go back to certain earlier writers is to regain a sense of human possibility,” Howe wrote. “To go back to Leskov is to regain a sense of the passion, sometimes the joy, that can be part of the human enterprise.” Now, thanks to this delicious new collection, the time is once again ripe for Leskov’s resurgence."

Lost and Found,2013-05-10,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A diary washes ashore, linking a teenager in Japan and an author in Canada in Ruth Ozeki’s latest novel.","Nao, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, is in a cafe in Tokyo, writing in her diary. She is, she declares, a “time being,” with all the ambiguity that phrase implies. Many months later, after Japan’s devastating earthquake and tsunami, a Japanese-American novelist named Ruth, living on an island off the coast of British Columbia, finds a barnacle-encrusted freezer bag washed up on the beach. It contains, it appears, a copy of Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time” and a broken watch, along with some letters. But Proust’s book is no more than a cover. Inside is Nao’s diary, written in purple ink."

For another kind, it is a stage.” The speaker is a smart high school girl working at the town’s diner, watching “the athletes and beauty queens who’d blossomed early and fierce,” and the setting is Bakerton, a western Pennsylvania coal-mining town, where Jennifer Haigh’s 2005 novel “Baker Towers” was also set.

But the “manly voice” with “pipes and whistles in his sound,” as Shakespeare put it, reverberates in its own distinctive fashion in the retirement home setting of McCorkle’s new novel, where the yoga class finds “a whole roomful of old folks breathing deeply and chanting — one sounding like a sewing machine and another a squirrel.”"
Packing the Courts,2013-05-10,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A primer on the Federalist Society and its extraordinary influence.,"More than two decades ago, when I was a law student, I used to sneak into meetings of the conservative Federalist Society for lunchtime conversations about constitutional issues. Although neither conservative nor a Republican, I had libertarian leanings and appreciated the society’s openness to debating its political opponents. I felt slightly illicit in crossing ideological lines: once, when the dean spotted me leaving a meeting, I felt as if I’d been caught walking out of an X-rated movie. But the discussions themselves were always intellectually engaging, and my fellow law students seemed more interested in converging around a shared approach to interpreting the Constitution than in squabbling about partisan differences.

For years, the three best friends have played a continuous, ever evolving game of make-believe embracing fictional kingdoms, characters and allegiances, using toy figurines and hastily assembled objects to stand in for the real thing.

Editor’s Letter | Away We Go,2013-05-10,article,News,,[],"Travel, and travel writing, should be able to open our minds — and even to change them.","Travel journalism often falls into one of two camps — the highly didactic and servicey piece, “go here, stay there, see that,” or the long-winded narrative in which the writer has the experience and we are meant to be satisfied by the first-person blow-by-blow he or she has brought back for us: “the road into town was dusty and unpaved and the driver kept getting lost.” The former is best served up by the Internet on demand. (You can find all of our hotel and restaurant suggestions for the stories in this issue at tmagazine.com.) And the pure version of the latter is perhaps best left to brilliant writers who promise to reward you for coming along (Edith Wharton, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Evelyn Waugh, Jan Morris). There are of course also intellectual and cultural histories of locales, in which the writer seeks to tease out the influences — historical, economic, social, stylistic, culinary and political — that make the place uniquely what it is (V. S. Naipaul, Bruce Chatwin, Ryszard Kapuscinski). The type we favor at T is a hybrid of the three, in which great writing and personal narrative is done in the service of not just traipsing along with the writer who got to go on an amazing journey that we didn’t, but of bringing you back a new understanding of a place that is enlightening and satisfying regardless of whether you ever plan to visit. And yet, if you do choose to go, we’re there to guide you."

The ritual part comes to light in the second half, “First Field.” Ms. Sigman attempts to alter the landscape, both physically and spiritually, by bringing nature inside."

Mr. Othman’s new pledge was met with widespread skepticism, with some legal experts saying he might be seeking to pre-empt a move favored by some in the government who have urged that Mr. Othman, currently held in prison for breaking bail conditions forbidding his use of cellphones and computers, be flown back to Jordan peremptorily, in defiance of British and European court rulings in his favor.

What’s on Sunday,2013-05-12,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10:30 P.M. (HBO) FAMILY TREE In this new, largely improvised series from Christopher Guest and Jim Piddock, Chris O’Dowd plays the down-on-his-luck Tom Chadwick, a 30-year-old Briton grappling with his identity since losing his girlfriend and his job. But when his Great-Aunt Victoria bequeaths him a chest of curios, he starts investigating his lineage to understand better who he and his unconventional family actually are. The ventriloquist Nina Conti plays his sister, Bea, who speaks through a monkey hand puppet; Michael McKean, above right, with Mr. O’Dowd, is their father. In this premiere episode, Tom finds a black-and-white portrait thought to be of his great-grandfather Harry and tracks down Neville St. Aubrey (Christopher Fairbank), an oddball antique photography expert. Tom’s best friend, Pete (Tom Bennett), meanwhile, fixes him up with a model. But what kind, exactly, no one is sure. “There is a familiarity to the series,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “As in Mr. Guest’s films, its story is less important than the presentation of a gallery of eccentrics, ranging from mildly odd to completely loony.” One result, Mr. Hale said, is that the series “can feel a little loose and inconsequential” as Tom “unearths one dotty, inglorious relative after another.” But “that also means that we get to spend more time with Mr. Guest’s crack cast of improvisers,” he added, “and there are moments in each half-hour that pay off.”"

The suit, filed in both state and federal courts, was brought on behalf of the child’s adoptive parents and is intended to restrict the practice of medically unnecessary sex assignment surgeries on infants, said lawyers with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Physically, it spreads across the undulating Edwards Plateau, with Austin to the east and San Antonio to the south. Near the center is Fredericksburg, which was once the main show in these parts, but no longer. To get a feeling for the Hill Country in the second sense — the state of mind where cool mingles with tradition, and industriousness and idleness are equally esteemed values (depending on the time of day) — head out among the limestone knolls full of live oak groves and cypress-lined creeks, and to the gritty pin-dot towns built largely of native stone. Here you’ll find a delicious tension between rural and refined. Inns and restaurants are bringing a clever touch to Lone Star hospitality and mythology, and with the vineyards and boutique farms (lavender, olives), some people make comparisons to Napa Valley or even Provence. But those assessments ignore something fundamental: the Hill Country — being Texas at its finest — is like nowhere else in the world."

Although the show features solo designs by each (wooden tortoises and lily-pad tables by Kiss, and tree-mushroom-shaped wall shelves by Lehrecke, to name a few), their joint efforts include a series of pieces in white oak designed by Lehrecke with cast-bronze pulls (also mushroom-shaped) by Kiss. The long, lean chest of drawers shown here, which incorporates a branch from a dead oak tree, is $22,000 at Ralph Pucci International (44 West 18th Street)."
That Hideous Strength,2013-05-17,article,News,,[],It’s always sunny in Ireland.,"The FT has an interesting article on problems with Irish GNP (not GDP) accounting; essentially, measured Irish income is being inflated by foreign companies with no real activity there that nonetheless find ways to make profits materialize in a low-tax jurisdiction. We sort of knew this was happening — that, for example, a lot of the apparent rise in productivity was just a shift to pharma companies that produce a lot of reported value-added but add little to the Irish economy. But the new ESRI report suggests that the problem is bigger than realized."

Are You My Father?,2013-05-17,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An unhappy woman discovers a distressing secret in Patrick McGrath’s novel.,"At a party in 1960s Manhattan, a beautiful blonde named Constance meets a professor of poetry many years her senior. After a brief and not especially rigorous courtship, she agrees to become his wife. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, this psychologically fragile young woman — whose emotional and sexual frigidity is strongly signposted right from the start — seems trapped and unhappy, resisting her husband’s apparently good-hearted attempts to make her feel loved and secure. Meanwhile, across town, her sister, Iris — equally beautiful and blond, but with a disheveled, bohemian promiscuity and a deliciously described aptitude for “being not withholding with the cleavage” — is engaged in an affair with a man who plays the piano in the bar of a shabby hotel. When Constance is introduced to this married “lush” from Miami, his very presence so unsettles and (she imagines) repulses her, that she persuades him to break off his affair with Iris. Who promptly falls apart."

Like hunger or fatigue, their loneliness comes and goes and isn’t defining: talk to them for an hour and they forget it. Chronics, though, are another story. They feel lonely playing games and being with family and moving through crowds and having sex.

Between Hay’s time as Abraham Lincoln’s secretary and Theodore Roosevelt’s top diplomat, the United States changed even more than it did between Kennedy and Bush.

It’s not the first best seller the show has spawned, either: “The Duck Commander Family,” by Phil’s son Willie and daughter-in-law Korie (with Schlabach again), is at No. 7 in its sixth week, riding the coattails of a season finale that drew 9.6 million viewers last month. “Happy, Happy, Happy” takes its title from Robertson’s catchphrase, and presents itself as a rustic guide to the good life — one chapter, “Redneck Caviar,” declares that “Rule No. 11 for living happy, happy, happy” is to “suck the head of a crawfish (you’ll want to do it again and again).” Part of the Robertsons’ charm is that they seem genuinely well adjusted, like the Waltons’ hairier cousins; every episode ends with a family prayer and a dinner prepared by Phil’s wife, Kay, whom he married when he was 16 and she was 15. “If you can find a nice, pretty country girl who can cook and carries her Bible,” he advises readers, “now, there’s a woman. She might even be ugly, but if she cooks squirrels and dumplings, then that’s the woman you go after.”"
Paid to Be Good,2013-05-17,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],At the center of the plot lines in Jean Thompson’s novel is a philanthropist who wants to bribe people into virtue.,"Linnea is a good kid from a home that lies somewhere in that wide gray zone between stable and chaotic, more dysfunctional than not — in other words, an emblematic American household. Her stepdad is “O.K.,” her younger half-brother is “pretty cool,” her stepsister is a mean girl and a bully; but Linnea loves her mom, and since she can’t remember her feckless, long-lost father, she doesn’t really miss him. Theirs is a typical blended family, so sadly representative that the nightmare that demolishes their relative peace and turns Linnea into an unreachable, volatile teenager is a school shooting — a signature American tragedy. Suffice it to say that the details of that awful day are blood-chilling and unbearable. As survivors go, Linnea is especially unlucky. She’s earned her trauma, and she wears it like a badge."
Bigger Than Soccer Itself,2013-05-17,article,News,,"['Soccer', 'Basketball']",Sportswriters used the soccer star David Beckham’s retirement to analyze his global appeal and to recall him as a brand as much as a player.,"For a while, Thursday seemed like a perfect day for goodbyes. And in a way, the timing was perfect. It is, after all, graduation season. David Beckham kicked things off by announcing he would graduate to being just a global icon, minus the soccer-playing part. The Knicks seemed poised to move on to the golf-playing portion of their season with an elimination game against the Indiana Pacers, but decided to stick around, perhaps just to annoy people, including their doomsaying fans. But we did say goodbye to Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist’s perfection and any chance the N.B.A.'s Western Conference playoffs would be moderately fun to watch."

A million golden arrows point to Neverland, and you can reach Oz by passing through a gate studded with glittering emeralds. The heft of “Or else!” in cautionary tales about children going up in flames after playing with matches was replaced with the incandescent beauty of “What if?” Writers aspired to lure children into fantasy worlds that would leave them, as Frances Hodgson Burnett put it, “breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.”"

There is, surrounding prize anthologies especially, an inevitable whiff of Ozymandias — these were the best writers of their day, the editors proclaimed, yet who today has heard of most of them?

Yellow fever vaccine is relatively safe but causes more dangerous side effects than many other vaccines and is therefore normally given only to healthy people who are at risk. The mosquito-borne disease, for which there is no cure, strikes about 200,000 people worldwide each year and kills about 30,000 of them. Cases are increasing as deforestation increases contact with forest mosquitoes and the monkeys that harbor the virus. Only nine cases have been found in the United States over the past 30 years, all in travelers returning from Africa or Latin America, but eight were fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Thomas P. Monath, a yellow fever expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that the W.H.O. announcement made sense for almost all vaccine recipients, but that booster shots might still be needed for laboratory technicians working with the virus and for a few travelers who had one shot many years ago but whose immunity had waned."

Her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), wants her to behave more like a lady. The queen has also beckoned local clan leaders to bring their sons by the castle to compete for her daughter’s hand, causing a furious Merida to rebel. When her defiance doesn’t work, she seeks help from a witch (Julie Walters), who casts a spell that sidelines the queen — and eventually prompts Merida to embark on a mission to rescue her mother and, in the process, save her family. Entering “the big business of little girls,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, “hasn’t been easy, to judge by the deep divide between the movie’s seductive pictorial splendor and its discouragingly uninspired script by Mark Andrews, Steve Purcell, Brenda Chapman and Irene Mecchi. (Ms. Chapman, the first woman hired to direct a Pixar feature, either left or was removed from “Brave” and now shares directing credit with Mr. Andrews.)” Still, “the animation, particularly in the outdoor scenes, can be transfixing with the photorealist details — every blade of grass and each hair in Angus’s mane looks perfectly individuated — blending seamlessly with the cartoon impressionism,” Ms. Dargis wrote, adding: “The association of Merida with the natural world accounts for some of the movie’s most beautifully animated sequences, and in other, smarter or maybe just braver, hands it might have also inspired new thinking about women, men, nature and culture.”"

In 2011 he won a TED Prize, given annually to a person with a bold vision to prompt global change. The result was the Inside Out Project, which challenged residents of often perilous and politically unstable environments to generate their own photographic messages — no logos or hate messages allowed — and send them to him. J R then printed giant images of the photographs and returned them to their creators, to be pasted up “in a place with meaning.” This documentary, directed by Alastair Siddons, follows J R as he travels the world to motivate communities to define their most important causes. More than 130,000 people have pasted messages in some 10,000 places in 100 countries, including Brazil, Tunisia, Pakistan, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, France and the United States.

But, she added, as in all of Mr. Anderson’s films, “there’s a deep, pervasive melancholia here too, a sense of regret evident in Mr. Bishop’s slouch (with his plaid pants, he is a walking John Cheever tragedy) and in the way Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look, and don’t look, at each other. Adulthood can seem so desperately painful, so maybe Sam and Suzy shouldn’t be quite as eager to grow up.” Still, Ms. Dargis said: “Sam and Suzy, while their story has the charms of a fairy tale and some of its terrors, aren’t playing at love. They are in love, and that is the most real thing in the world.” Mr. Anderson and Mr. Coppola earned an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay."

Why Time May Be Running Out for Brazil’s State Championships,2013-05-23,article,News,,['Soccer'],"Brazil’s state championships clutter the schedule and bore everyone from fans to players, but they are still worth saving.","BREAKING NEWS: The Premier League has announced that next year’s top division will be played over seven months, rather than the current 10. The off-season will also be cancelled. Instead, for five months of the year the country’s biggest clubs will play provincial tournaments against their much smaller lower-division neighbors. The Manchester giants City and Utd will be tested by not just Bolton and Wigan, but will also have trips to Hyde, Altrincham and Stalybridge Celtic. Players will risk injury on bumpy pitches, most of the games will be as competitive as a dust-up between Anderson Silva and Justin Bieber, and the resulting fixture squeeze will mean that there will be no time to accommodate FIFA international dates, so clubs will play a host of league fixtures without their star players, who’ll be away on international duty.

The piece’s author, Tony Dokoupil, actually goes a little bit further than I would: Given how much of suicide’s new statistical prominence is explained by the (happy) decline in other ways of death, and given that suicide rates were dipping in the U.S. up until the turn of millenium, I’m not sure that the language of “epidemic” quite makes sense at this point; I think the Center for Disease Control’s formulation, “an increasing public health concern,” is a more appropriate way of putting it. The big question, as my column tried to suggest, is where the current trend is going, and whether the upward movement is likely to persist. And here the Newsweek essay has a good distillation of the case for pessimism:"

When Photography Imitates Voyeurism,2013-05-23,article,News,,"['Art', 'Photography', 'Privacy']","It might be art, but does that make it O.K.?","“The Neighbors,” an exhibition now at the Julie Saul Gallery in Chelsea, is, as you may have read, angering many residents of a certain TriBeCa building. Arne Svenson’s photographs, which he shot using a telephoto lens from inside his own apartment across the street, capture people at home through their windows. The neighbors, who were unaware they were being photographed, are somewhat obscured — bending over, back to the window, head turned, behind a curtain — and therefore mostly unidentifiable. But the subjects are recognizable to themselves, and maybe others."

Their Own Petard,2013-05-23,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Janet Malcolm’s penetrating profiles are case studies in defeated amour-propre.,"The most revealing moment in Janet Malcolm’s new collection of essays and profiles, “Forty-One False Starts,” comes toward the end of “A Girl of the Zeitgeist,” her 1986 piece about Ingrid Sischy, who was then the editor of Artforum. The reader can hardly help noticing that while Sischy is the titular girl, she is not much in evidence in the piece itself, which is largely a portrait gallery of various art-world blowhards and monomaniacs. Malcolm admits that she hoped Sischy would be “some sort of strikingly modern type, some astonishing new female sensibility loosed in the world.” What she found instead is that Sischy was, to put it simply, a good person: “a pleasant, intelligent, unassuming, responsible, ethical young woman.” Naturally, Malcolm concludes, “I . . . turned away in disappointment.”"

The Men Who Would Be King,2013-05-24,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],William Dalrymple seeks contemporary lessons in Britain’s disastrous 19th-century invasion of Afghanistan.,"The story of the British invasion of Afghanistan in 1839-42 (what was later called the First Afghan War) can be briefly told. A British Army entered the country in April 1839, captured Kabul and ejected the ruler Dost Mohammad Khan. He was replaced by Shah Shuja, who had been living in exile since his overthrow by Dost Mohammad and his brother some 30 years earlier. The British expected Shah Shuja to be a more pliable king, a client of their Indian Raj, and a more reliable ally against the intrigues of the Russians. But they underestimated the resentment that their presence would arouse, and inflamed Afghan hostility by their overbearing behavior. After they failed to quell an uprising in Kabul and their envoy was murdered, they agreed to withdraw. But the retreating army of British officers, Indian soldiers and a multitude of camp followers was slaughtered almost to a man as it struggled back through the Khyber Pass in January 1842. Some months later, the British returned with an “army of retribution.” After a short stay in Kabul, and some indiscriminate killing, they withdrew once more. Dost Mohammad returned (with their blessing) to resume his place on the throne. Ever since this fiasco, an entire phalanx of writers has denounced the arrogance, folly and incompetence of the British aggressors (of which there was plenty) and has drawn a predictable lesson: those who invade Afghanistan pay a high price in treasure and blood — and also inflict one on its unlucky peoples. The latest (and most brilliant) in this long line of critics is William Dalrymple and his “Return of a King.”"

At first Adam is resistant. Then Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” begins to throb. “What happens will be familiar if you’ve ever seen one of those variations on the fallen-woman movie,” Ms. Dargis wrote. “In the past the movies were very much preoccupied with the moral regulation of women, but here the stress is on Mike’s struggle to succeed as he juggles his part-time gigs (dancing, auto detailing and construction) with his desire to build custom furniture.” She added: “The collaboration between Mr. Soderbergh and the relatively untested Mr. Tatum is itself a gamble, one that has brought out the best in each. What could have been an embarrassing misfire hinted at by the movie’s misleading trailers is instead a smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatum’s heat and charm — and ambitions that are as transparent as Mike’s — with Mr. Soderbergh’s cool, cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations.” "

What’s On Sunday,2013-05-26,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) BEHIND THE CANDELABRA (2013) Michael Douglas, above, stars as the piano showman Liberace, and Matt Damon is Scott Thorson, his chauffeur, lover and adopted son, in this film biography from the director Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese. Set in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Palm Springs, the film chronicles the men’s relationship as Liberace picks up and possesses Mr. Thorson, has him cosmetically altered in his image and legally adopts him before discarding him for a younger model. “There’s something uncanny, even brilliant,” about Mr. Douglas’s impersonation of Liberace, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “Sashaying across Las Vegas stages and epic suburban living rooms with a drum major’s puffed-up grandeur and a lounge lizard’s predatory smile, Mr. Douglas gives a performance so assured, so free of camp or cringe, that you quickly surrender any doubts you might have had about his playing a  famously flamboyant, closeted-in-plain-sight gay entertainer.” At the same time, he said, “there’s something limited, and limiting, about Mr. Douglas’s portrayal. Its brilliance feels as if it were all on the surface, a matter of expertise and professionalism.” And the same could be said of Mr. Soderbergh’s film, he added. “A cerebral gloss on, and satire of, a big old Hollywood biopic, it’s full of smart, funny details — perfectly sewn in place, like the rhinestones on one of Mr. Douglas’s blinding costumes — but it’s short on heart, or heat.”"

How to Get a Job,2013-05-29,article,Op-Ed,,"['Labor and Jobs', 'Computers and the Internet', 'Hiring and Promotion']","The rules have changed in today’s labor market.

So, more employers are designing their own tests to measure applicants’ skills. And they increasingly don’t care how those skills were acquired: home schooling, an online university, a massive open online course, or Yale. They just want to know one thing: Can you add value?"

At one end of that desk there’s a space that used to be a closet, but at McCann’s request, the friend who built the office took off the door and put a platform in there, and this is where McCann writes, “in the cupboard,” as he put it. “It concentrates my vision. No windows, two very tight walls.” He sits on a couple of cushions with his computer on his lap. On the wall beside him are dozens of messages scrawled by friends and kids and fellow writers and some by McCann himself: “What is the source of our first suffering? It lies in the fact that we hesitated to speak. It was born in the moment when we accumulated silent things within us.” “Keep yourself away from answers, but alive in the middle of the question.” “Stay rotten.” “Hi, Dad, I love you.”"

The artist Theaster Gates knows how creativity can invigorate a community. What happens when they put their heads together?At first glance, an Internet entrepreneur and an artist seem to operate in different creative spheres. Yet Perry Chen, the co-founder and C.E.O. of the crowd-funding Web site Kickstarter, and Theaster Gates, a Chicago art star-cum-urban planner, actually think they have a lot in common. Kickstarter began in 2009, and since then the site has raised more than $500 million for 40,000 projects — from Iraq war documentaries to Brooklyn restaurants — revolutionizing the way creative ideas are financed in the digital age. Theaster Gates’s artistic practice, which encompasses everything from sculpture to a roving choir, is in its way just as groundbreaking. On his own block on the South Side of Chicago, Gates has engineered a miniature urban utopia, turning the once-blighted buildings that surround him into artist residencies, a library and even a cinema house that shows works by aspiring filmmakers from the neighborhood. Both Gates’s and Chen’s work may inspire social change, but it’s the power of creativity, not of compassion, that spurs them from one genre-defying innovation to the next."

Alfred Prufrock” expressed satire; I submitted it for assignments in both my poetry course as well as my completely separate satire course. I did not disclose this to either professor. When I share this with people, half call the practice cheating, and the other half call it genius. My niece told me it would certainly be grounds for expulsion at her college. In my mind, I was adding a level of intellectual complexity to my studies. Was this an ethical practice, or was I cheating? JOE, CONNECTICUT"

Listen Up | Eleanor Friedberger’s ’70s Song Craft,2013-05-31,article,News,,['Music'],"The singer-songwriter, previously known as the frontwoman for the brother-sister duo Fiery Furnaces, has established herself as a solo artist to be reckoned with.","“I think we’re drawn to the decade we were born in,” said the singer-songwriter Eleanor Friedberger, who was born in 1976. “I love looking at ’70s interiors, textiles or graphic design and thinking, If I could turn this picture into music, what would it sound like?” Her songs do sound the way a Barbara D’Arcy room or Milton Glaser album cover looks: warm, inviting and groovy. Though she’s best known as the frontwoman for the Fiery Furnaces, the Brooklyn indie rock band she founded with her brother Matthew more than a decade ago, the release of “Personal Record” (Merge), her second solo album next week, should solidify her identity as a stand-alone musician. Steeped in the analog sounds of Me Decade icons like Harry Nilsson, Emitt Rhodes and Caetano Veloso, the album is more mellifluous and emotionally resonant than the Furnaces’ eccentric work. Instead, it builds on the classic song craft of Friedberger’s 2011 solo debut, “Last Summer,” interweaving bossa nova beats and British folk balladry with summer-road-trip rock ‘n’ roll. It’s as relatable — and as much a career high-water mark — as its title suggests. “I don’t get to hide under a band blanket,” she says of flying solo. “But it also feels more authentically me.”"

Hidden in Plain Sight,2013-05-31,article,Review,,"['Art', 'Books and Literature']","“Various Small Books” is a collection of pictures and essays showing how other artists have copied, parodied or otherwise paid homage to the work of Ed Ruscha.","In the late 1970s, I purchased a half-dozen pocket-size paperback books that bore the name Ed Ruscha. I hadn’t heard of the California artist at the time — I just liked the look of his booklets. One was bound with ribbon; the rest were perfect binds. There were no cover pictures; only widely spaced titles typeset in a serif font that I also liked to use, called Stymie Bold. The cover designs were distinct yet understated, reminiscent of small-press poetry collections. Inside were photographic records of what each title promised — “Various Small Fires,”  “Thirtyfour Parking Lots,”  “Twentysix Gasoline Stations,”  “Nine Swimming Pools,”  “Crackers” (with text by Mason Williams on “How to Derive the Maximum Enjoyment From Crackers”) and “Babycakes” (with photographs of, yes, a baby and cakes). They were puzzling yet clearly ironic, prefiguring many books by today’s conceptual artists. The critical mass of decidedly mundane pictures gave them their allure. Marcel Duchamp’s “ready-mades” and Andy Warhol’s soup cans had already elevated everyday objects to the status of art, but Ruscha’s small books brought the ennobled vernacular back down to earth."

The 12 issues included in this edition were written by Warren Ellis and illustrated by Bryan Hitch. The series was originally bought in 1999, and captured some creative magic. The heroes (Jenny Sparks, who embodied the spirit of the 20th Century; Apollo and Midnighter, crime-fighting lovers who were analogues of Superman and Batman; Jack Hawksmoor, who could communicate with and control cities) were captivating, and the artwork was exquisite. The first year found the heroes fighting bigger and bigger threats as a team. The first four issues featured a nation of terrorists who were bred to have Superman-like powers and who were bent on destroying major world cities. The middle story arc featured an invasion from a parallel word. The final four issues featured the team confronting no less than the incomprehensible godlike creator of the solar system that wanted to cleanse the universe of humanity. (The heroes won!) Versions of these heroes continue to be featured in “Stormwatch,” a monthly series published by DC, but there are only sparks of the audaciousness that were once a hallmark of the series."

‘The People’s Car: A Global History of the Volkswagen Beetle’,2013-05-31,article,First Chapter,,"['Books and Literature', 'Automobiles']",An excerpt from “The People’s Car: A Global History of the Volkswagen Beetle.”,"After decades of austerity caused first by the Depression and prolonged by the Second World War, the fifties turned into a “golden age of the American automobile” that saw car registra­tions jump from 25.8 million in 1945 to 52.1 million in 1955. Lifestyle changes underpinned demand for cars. As the postwar suburban population grew by 43 percent between 1947 and 1953, daily routines, not least those of women who wished to visit the new suburban shopping malls and plazas, increasingly relied on access to individual transport. The car and the housing booms were intimately linked, with average individual expenditure on these items tripling in real terms between 1941 and 1961. By the end of the fifties, 40 percent of American drivers  were female — a far higher proportion than anywhere in Western Eu rope. As a dealer told a journalist investigating why Americans bought Volkswagens in 1955, the car “‘was just the thing for the wife to run around town in.’ Two- car suburbia is where Volkswagen has made its biggest inroads.” Market surveys from the fifties and early sixties also revealed that, while over 60 percent of Beetles registered in the United States served as second cars, about two- thirds of the customers who signed a purchase con­tract in a dealership had attended college. In short, Volkswagen attracted a foothold among the materially secure, white middle class whose members made up the bulk of suburbanites in the fifties."

The thunder moved nearer with every clap and the rain was ceaseless, coming down in sheets but the ground could no longer absorb it quickly enough and torrents of muddy water flowed past my wheels while huge chunks of the dirt road were disintegrating before my eyes. Overhanging trees and thorn bushes dangled in my path, scratching my face and ripping my waterproofs, allowing yet more rain to soak me quite literally, to the skin. This was wild, high, open country with not a glimmer of civilisation in sight; there were no people living here now, long since driven out in the civil war’s slashing and burning of the villages. I longed to see some evidence of the human hand at work, just a hut or a farmhouse, a truck or car. But the only signs of man’s existence were grim and sinister, in the shape of rusting tanks at the roadside and the crumbling concrete of improvised roadblocks."

For decades, closet conservators have not come out because of the pristine restoration focus that dominated the hobby. They worried that their scruffy treasure would pale on the show field. They were told a ground-up is mandatory. Was the preservation motivated by parsimony? And of course a trophy was out of the question. The mainstream seemed to abhor imperfection. While acknowledging their vehicle was technical jewelry in every way, they shamelessly changed its colors, trim, and even its design. Scores of unusual animals were sacrificed to add wow to the trim. No nut, bolt, or tie-rod arm escaped the chrome plater’s tank. Wire wheel spokes scintillated on the podium. Novel colors were protected with clear coat. When it was easier to replace than fix, the choice was easy. Racing damage was a badge of courage."
