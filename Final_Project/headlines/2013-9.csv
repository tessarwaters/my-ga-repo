Mr. Cousins, a film critic from Northern Ireland, “aims for comprehensiveness and coherence,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this 900-minute movie, presented in eight chapters. “He wants to tell the whole story, from Genesis to Revelation, as the saying goes, but he also wants this vast chronicle to have a shape and a point: themes and patterns amid the names, places and images. He succeeds to an impressive extent. The results of his dogged research, compulsive travel and hard thinking are exemplary, useful and sometimes thrilling.” Mr. Cousins and Robert Osborne will introduce each Monday episode, which begins here with movies from Thomas Edison’s New Jersey studio, at 8, and the Lumière brothers’ French studio, at 9:30, and “Birth of the Cinema (1900-1920),” the first episode of Mr. Cousins’s film, at 10. Georges Méliès’s short “Trip to the Moon” (1902), follows at 11:15, and Alice Guy-Blaché’s shorts “Falling Leaves” (1912), “Canned Harmony” (1912) and “A House Divided” (1913), at 11:30.

Griffith’s Civil War epic, “The Birth of a Nation” (1915), at 2; and his “Orphans of the Storm” (1921), above, starring Lillian and Dorothy Gish as sisters struggling to find each other during the French Revolution, at 5:15."

What’s on Tuesday,2013-09-03,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"5:10 P.M. (MoreMax) MAGIC MIKE (2012) In a role loosely inspired by his stint as a stripper in Florida, Channing Tatum, above center, stars as the gyrating main attraction at the Xquisite dance club, in what Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called “Steven Soderbergh’s funny, enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream.” Alex Pettyfer plays Adam, a college dropout who is pushed onstage at Xquisite. At first Adam is resistant. Then Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” begins to throb. “What happens will be familiar if you’ve ever seen one of those variations on the fallen-woman movie,” Ms. Dargis wrote. “In the past, the movies were very much preoccupied with the moral regulation of women, but here, the stress is on Mike’s struggle to succeed as he juggles his part-time gigs (dancing, auto detailing and construction) with his desire to build custom furniture.” She added: “The collaboration between Mr. Soderbergh and the relatively untested Mr. Tatum is itself a gamble, one that has brought out the best in each. What could have been an embarrassing misfire hinted at by the movie’s misleading trailers is instead a smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatum’s heat and charm — and ambitions that are as transparent as Mike’s — with Mr. Soderbergh’s cool, cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations.” "

Kagame’s office is on top of a hill near the center of Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, and I took a taxi there, driven by a man in a suit and tie. Whenever I’m in Kigali, I am always impressed by how spotless it is, how the city hums with efficiency, which is all the more remarkable considering that Rwanda remains one of the poorest nations in the world. Even on a Saturday morning, platoons of women in white gloves rhythmically swept the streets, softly singing to themselves. I passed the Union Trade Center mall in the middle of town, where traffic circulates smoothly around a giant fountain. There was no garbage in the streets and none of the black plastic bags that get tangled up in the fences and trees of so many other African cities — Kagame’s government has banned them. There were no homeless youth sleeping on the sidewalks or huffing glue to kill their hunger. In Rwanda, vagrants and petty criminals have been scooped up by the police and sent to a youth “rehabilitation center” on an island in the middle of Lake Kivu that some Rwandan officials jokingly call their Hawaii — because it is so lush and beautiful — though people in Kigali whisper about it as if it were Alcatraz.

Most of the homes lost in the fire were uninsured or underinsured, she said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency denied the disaster declaration on Aug. 9, saying repairs were not “beyond the capabilities” of state and local agencies. "

What’s on Thursday,2013-09-05,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (FX Movie Channel) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after people die by braiding together three story lines, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon, above), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, chooses a life of obscurity instead of exploiting his gift. In London, Marcus, a solemn boy, feels the presence of his twin, Jason, whose violent death has left Marcus adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris, Marie Lelay (Cécile de France), who nearly died in the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, is convinced that she has seen a metaphysical reality the world is determined to ignore. “Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood,” A. O. Scott said in The New York Times of this film, written by Peter Morgan. “What does seem new — newly strange, newly beautiful — is what ‘Hereafter’ makes of the here and now,” Mr. Scott added. “It is a curious movie in both senses of the word: an unusual experience and an open-ended inquiry into something nobody can really claim to understand. It leaves you wondering, which may be the most fitting way of saying that it’s wonderful.”"

A stuffed goat, a torn shirt or tie, a wheelbarrow and even his own bed — all became fodder for paintings or sculptures, which would later incorporate sound and electronics as well. Rauschenberg had a counterpart in the Swiss-born Jean Tinguely, who had his debut at the Museum of Modern Art after arriving in New York in January 1960. The show consisted of a gigantic motorized sculpture assembled from bicycle wheels, a piano, a bathtub and other detritus, which was designed to self-destruct in flames before a live audience. Rauschenberg made an ad hoc contribution to the piece with a toaster that spit out silver dollars. That “collaboration” spurred a lifelong friendship that would embrace other bricoleurs of the French “New Realist” group then living in New York: Arman, Martial Raysse and Tinguely’s future wife, Niki de Saint Phalle — all artists who subscribed to Rauschenberg’s belief in closing the gap between art and life. This month, the Sperone Westwater gallery brings the group together again with “Radio Waves: New York ‘Nouveau Réalisme’ and Rauschenberg,” an exhibition of 13 rarely seen scrap assemblages and drawings from the artist’s personal collection (Sept. 17 to Nov. 2)."

They wield blowtorches and wear fireproof suits in the crushing heat, and — according to reporting by Ernesto Londoño at The Washington Post — it takes about 12 hours to demolish each of the vehicles. The trucks need to be cut into pieces small enough to be fed into industrial metal shredders, which grind the parts down into tiny bits of scrap that are sold locally for a few cents per pound. In May, about 11 million pounds of this scrap were apparently sold; by now it is probably more. The contractors who buy it call it “gold dust.”"

What’s on Friday,2013-09-06,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) ZERO DARK THIRTY (2012) Jessica Chastain, in an Oscar-nominated role, portrays Maya, a C.I.A. officer obsessed with finding Osama bin Laden, in Kathryn Bigelow’s fictionalized intelligence procedural. (Above, Ms. Chastain with Christopher Stanley.) Tushaar Mehra is Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, the lead that Maya and her colleagues, including Dan (Jason Clarke) and Jessica (Jennifer Ehle), chase over the next eight years, using controversial interrogation techniques on prisoners to extract information. “The abuse scenes are crucial to ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ because they serve as a claim — one made cinematically rather than with speeches — that these interrogation methods are unreliable when it comes to producing actionable information,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. To omit them “would have been a reprehensible act of moral cowardice.” She added: “Ms. Bigelow’s direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It’s pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically nontriumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before — the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals — has led to this.”"

Who Made That Catcher’s Mask?,2013-09-06,article,News,,"['Baseball', 'Inventions and Patents', 'Masks']",A bird cage for your face.,"In the early 1870s, catchers played bare faced. Balls routinely struck their eyes, broke their noses and knocked out their teeth. The danger increased when catchers, who had stood two dozen feet behind the batter, moved closer to the plate — an innovation, says the baseball historian Peter Morris, “that allowed the top pitchers to throw their best pitches.” The facial injuries finally decreased when a team from Harvard University rigged up a mask to protect its catchers that resembled a sturdy bird cage. The manager of the team, Frederick Thayer, patented the mask in 1878. Fans hated it. When the Harvard catcher James Tyng stepped onto the field with his head swaddled in steel and leather, he endured jeers from the crowd — people hooted at the mad dog who had to be “muzzled.” Editorial writers complained that the innovation detracted from the game. What was next — a lightning rod to save the catcher from freak storms? Would players limp around the bases with stovepipes on their legs for protection?"

Lives of the Cells,2013-09-06,article,Review,,"['Cancer', 'Books and Literature']",A journalist’s report on what cancer is and how it occurs illuminates deep biological processes.,"Cancer would seem a dreary, frightful topic if it weren’t also such a universal one. In this era of longer human life spans, it’s almost as inevitable as death and ­taxes. Most of us will experience some form of cancer — if not in our own bodies then at close remove, through the suffering of loved ones — and therefore none of us can afford to ignore it. Knowledge is better than ignorant dread, and good writing based on keen reporting is far better than medical jargon, garbled hearsay or misinformation from the Web. That’s just one reason for reading George Johnson’s graceful book, “The Cancer Chronicles.” Another is that the biological details of just what cancer is and how it occurs are (forgive me for saying so) fascinating. And not just fascinating but also, as handled by Johnson, revealing of certain deep truths about life itself. Those truths involve two elemental concepts, familiar (if dimly) from high school biology and physics: mitosis and entropy. More on that fateful pair in a moment."

The Drift of Years,2013-09-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Alice McDermott’s novel centers on an ordinary life, as captured in scattered recollections.","Over a decade ago, The New Yorker ran a short story I’ve never been able to forget. A wisp of a thing, barely more than twice the length of this review, it contains little action, less plot. It doesn’t seem to be about anything — except a whole life. We meet the unnamed protagonist as a child clearing ice-cream dishes from the family dinner table, surreptitiously licking the “creamy dregs” from each one. We glimpse her as a teenager necking on the couch, as a young wife reveling in the domestic sensuality of motherhood, as an older woman attending her husband’s deathbed, even then unable to keep from physical contact, “her open lips brushing . . . the surgical tape that secured the respirator in his mouth.” In the end, Alice McDermott’s “Enough” is a portrait of a woman filtered through a sensory lens, capturing the life of the body, replete with exultation and ache. Which means this is also a story about mortality."
Memorial Days,2013-09-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"After a friend dies in a freak accident, former classmates converge on his hilltop estate.","His name’s all wrong for starters. Steve Rush, Marty Rush, Jake Rush all have a hard-boiled literary glamour. There is even a DJ Rush. But Norman? Only one last name goes with Norman, and that was nabbed by Mailer. Rush couldn’t be more inappropriate; Norman has never been in a. . . . His first book, “Whites,” a story collection, was published in 1986, when he was 53. Between that and “Subtle Bodies” there have been just two novels: a long one, “Mating,” and the even longer “Mortals.” It’s not the frequency of these sturdy ol’ buses so much as their speed that is remarkable, their emphatic rejection of notions of narrative urgency. Walking, to put it oxymoronically, is Rush’s preferred pace. In “Mating” the narrator recounts how she hiked to a utopian village presided over by the enigmatic Denoon, on whom she had developed a high-I.Q. crush. This was not a stroll to Fruitlands in Massachusetts; it was a trek through the Kalahari. She barely made it, almost gave up the ghost. Me too. "

Like most journalists covering the disaster, Pargaien dutifully described families who had lost everything, including their modest thatch-roofed homes. Unlike most journalists, Pargaien reported from the scene while perched on the shoulders of a flood victim in the middle of a swollen river. As the outrage poured in, Pargaien tried to explain himself. In an interview with the Indian Web site Newslaundry, he said the man who carried him had insisted upon it. “He was grateful to us and wanted to show me some respect,” Pargaien said, “as it was the first time someone of my level had visited his house.”"

R. Martin has never bludgeoned anybody with a battle-ax (as far as I can tell), and Jane Austen probably never met a zombie. But Kathy Reichs — whose mysteries about the forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan sold well even before they were adapted for the Fox television series “Bones” — knows where she’s coming from. Reichs earned her Ph.D. in physical anthropology from Northwestern University in 1975, and among other highlights in her busy career she has consulted with the United Nations on the Rwandan genocide and helped to identify the remains of 9/11 victims in Manhattan. Tempe Brennan, in other words, is a lot like her creator. “She’s me,” Reichs told a Canadian TV interviewer last month. “She does what I do. . . . She thinks the way I think.”"

The Ad Campaign: Spitzer Attacks Stringer on Term Limits,2013-09-06,article,News,,['Political Advertising'],"Eliot Spitzer started airing the first negative television ad of the campaign for comptroller, saying Scott M. Stringer cut a “back-room deal” to allow Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to run for a third term.","With polls suggesting that the Democratic primary for New York City comptroller is a dead heat, Eliot Spitzer has started airing the first negative television ad of the campaign. Titled “Our Voice,” it accuses his rival, Scott M. Stringer, of having cut a “back-room deal” to lift term limits and allow Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to run for a third term. The Spitzer campaign also started airing a Spanish-language version of the ad and a similar one on the radio.PRODUCER Siegel StrategiesTHE SCRIPT Voice-over: “Term limits were voted in by the people, until 20-year career politician Scott Stringer worked to destroy them, cutting a back-room deal to hand a third term to the mayor against the people’s will, even testifying before the City Council to get it done. Eliot Spitzer has always fought against the same special interests and back-room politicians supporting Stringer. Because Stringer didn’t only take away our term limits. He took away our voice. But this Sept. 10, we get to use it.”ON SCREEN The music, brassy and solemnly patriotic, sounds ripped from the score of a Western. There are images of Mr. Stringer, including one with Mr. Bloomberg, and a graphic of a piece of paper with “Term Limits” written on it being gradually torn to shreds. A phrase from a Christian Science Monitor article about the term-limits debate (“counter to the will of the voters”) flashes across the screen. As the music shifts to a more hopeful mode, the ad closes with images of Mr. Spitzer shaking hands with voters and patting them on the back, and a close-up on a Hispanic woman and a black man standing next to Mr. Spitzer.ACCURACY Mr. Stringer did testify before the Council in 2008, urging members to vote to extend term limits to 12 years, from 8 years. There is no evidence, however, that he was part of any “back-room deal” to hand Mr. Bloomberg a third term. He endorsed Mr. Bloomberg’s 2009 opponent, William C. Thompson Jr.As to whether Mr. Spitzer fought against “the same special interests and back-room politicians” that support Mr. Stringer, the claim is so broad that it is hard to quantify its measure of truth. If “special interests” refers to the unions that have endorsed Mr. Stringer, Mr. Spitzer was himself endorsed in previous campaigns by some of the same groups. However, as governor he also prominently clashed with one of the unions backing Mr. Stringer, 1199 S.E.I.U., over cuts that he proposed to health care. Mr. Stringer, like most major New York City candidates who are not self-financing, has accepted donations from people working on Wall Street. As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer led investigations into financial industry practices and made many enemies on Wall Street. The former governor is financing his campaign with money from his family’s real estate fortune.SCORECARD Although Mr. Stringer did support lifting term limits to allow Mr. Bloomberg to run for a third term, his role in the debate was minor. To accuse him of being part of a “back-room deal” is misleading. And although Mr. Stringer has been heavily supported by labor, a political action committee that threatened to raise major Wall Street money to back him has fizzled. The ad speaks to the caustic tone the campaign has taken in its final days; soon after this ad began airing on Thursday, the Stringer campaign went up with its own negative ad."
The Ad Campaign: Stringer Says Spitzer ‘Held Himself to a Different Standard’,2013-09-06,article,News,,['Political Advertising'],"Hours after Eliot Spitzer attacked him in a television commercial, Scott M. Stringer responded with his own negative spot, invoking the prostitution scandal that forced Mr. Spitzer to resign as governor in 2008.","Hours after Eliot Spitzer started broadcasting the first negative television commercial in the Democratic primary for comptroller, his opponent, Scott M. Stringer, responded with his own negative spot. Titled “Clear Choice,” it invokes the prostitution scandal that led Mr. Spitzer to resign as governor in 2008.PRODUCER GMMBTHE SCRIPT Announcer: “The Times, Post and Daily News all endorse Scott Stringer. He’ll audit every city agency to cut waste so we can invest in jobs and schools. And he far outdistances Eliot Spitzer in integrity. Spitzer jailed people for prostitution and financial crimes, but when he got caught doing the very same thing, he held himself to a different standard, and walked away scot-free. That’s why The Times, Post and Daily News all say the choice is clear: Scott Stringer, comptroller.”ON SCREEN The announcer speaks over what sounds like the upbeat theme music for an evening newscast, while the screen shows images of Mr. Stringer at his desk and talking to a man in a pharmacist’s coat, a flyover picture of City Hall and an image of a school hallway. When the narrator mentions Mr. Spitzer’s putting people in jail, a person is shown from the back in handcuffs. This is followed by black-and-white images of Mr. Spitzer, with the words “Same Crimes” and “Different Standard” and a CNN headline — “Spitzer Won’t Be Charged in Prostitution Scandal” — flashing on the screen. The ad ends with an image of the New York skyline and a photograph of Mr. Stringer on the Brooklyn Bridge.ACCURACY As far as prostitution goes, the ad is accurate. As governor, Mr. Spitzer was caught patronizing prostitutes, precipitating his resignation. The assertion that he committed financial crimes, however, is misleading. In announcing that they would not charge Mr. Spitzer, federal prosecutors said there was “insufficient evident to bring charges against Mr. Spitzer for any offense relating to the withdrawal of funds for, and his payments to” to the prostitution ring. The Times, The Daily News and The New York Post have all endorsed Mr. Stringer.SCORECARD If Mr. Stringer stuck to reminding voters that Mr. Spitzer patronized prostitutes — something that few have likely forgotten — he would be on solid ground. Bringing in financial crimes stretches the truth and the available evidence."

But at the Alexander Wang show this evening, there wasn’t a speck of foundation, eye shadow or lipstick anywhere in sight. “I call it raw beauty,” the makeup artist Diane Kendal said of the barely-there, extreme-minimalist look she created backstage. Proving the point, her routine took all of five minutes: she patted Nars Skin Aqua Gel Luminous Oil-Free Moisturizer on the skin to give it a “nice luminous” quality and dotted stick concealer down the sides of the nose and over any blemishes or redness. Lashes were curled; arches were set with a quick pass of brow gel. And that’s it. “It’s actually hard to tell which models have their makeup done and which don’t,” one observer noted, puzzled. Kendal couldn’t be happier about that. “Alexander loved that the girls looked so cool [when they came in for casting],” she said. “So we agreed that the more you do with makeup, the less cool it looks.” The models seemed to embrace the no-fuss effect. “It’s very au naturel,” Joan Smalls said, adding that “this is the fastest makeup I’ve had done for a show.” Jourdan Dunn called the pared-down approach “laid-back and easy,” while Hanne Gaby Odiele said, “It’s simple but fresh; it’s like how we walked in — but a little less tired.”"

What’s on Sunday,2013-09-08,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M.

Sarah Lancashire and Nicola Walker play the daughters who would be the last people to stand in the way of their parents’ happiness, but who can’t help themselves. “There’s nothing to be gained from saying unkind things about ‘Last Tango in Halifax,’ a warm comforter of a series,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “It’s based on actual, inspiring events in the life of the writer’s mother. And it has been expertly assembled and fine-tuned for maximum heartwarming effect, so those who like this sort of thing will like it very, very much.” But while the show “begins with a potentially interesting situation,” he said, it “proceeds to do little with it.” He added: “A good test of how you’ll respond to this ‘Last Tango’ could be how you responded to the film from which it (hilariously) borrows its title. If the portrait of despair in ‘Last Tango in Paris’ left you shattered but exhilarated, then ‘Last Tango in Halifax’ may not be your cup of tea.” In the season finale of “Silk,” at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, Martha (Maxine Peake) and Clive (Rupert Penry-Jones) have their Queen’s Counsel interviews as she takes on the biggest case in her career — defending a repeat offender charged with murder — while struggling to focus as the stress resulting from her personal life increases."

Backstage Beauty Report | Seashell-Like Updos at Carolina Herrera,2013-09-09,article,News,,[],Clean lines and flawless execution were key for this hairstyle by Orlando Pita.,"“I especially like structured, architectural updos — and not many people let you do that,” the hair wiz Orlando Pita said at the Carolina Herrera show earlier today. Herrera, though, is just the kind of designer who appreciates classic, clean lines, which Pita played up in the sleek, tightly coiled updos seen on her runway. “The shape was inspired by a long seashell with a swirl at the top,” he said. To achieve the effect, he brushed strands straight and generously misted on By Byron Spirulina Hair Spray for grip. Hair was then parted off to the side and divided into two sections at the back, each of which was rolled in toward the scalp, leaving a loop at the top, and pinned in place. “I need it tighter here,” Pita said, cupping the base of a model’s updo and ordering a redo. (Fact: even the pros don’t nail things on the first attempt.) The finished result was entirely right for the Herrera woman. “This isn’t a jeans-and-a-jacket kind of look — it’s cocktails and an event,” Pita noted, as the delicate clouds of hair spray settled around him."

Why Roger Federer Is the Greatest of All Time,2013-09-10,article,News,,"['Tennis', 'United States Open (Tennis)']","Yes, he has a lousy record against Nadal. But he’s displayed a consistency and durability at a time when the competition is deeper than it has ever been.","Roger Federer, who I wrote about in the magazine’s U.S. Open issue, was the big story coming into the Open; the state of his game dominated the conversation for most of the tournament. But the big story coming out of the Open is his longtime nemesis, Rafael Nadal, who won the men’s title last night with an enthralling four-set victory over the world No. 1, Novak Djokovic. The win gives the 27-year-old Spaniard his 13th grand-slam singles title at exactly the same age that Federer won his 13th, which leaves the whole GOAT debate even more unsettled. GOAT? That’s short for greatest of all time and is an acronym that has been tossed around promiscuously during the Federer years. With a record 17 majors highlighting his numerous career achievements, Federer has staked a strong claim to GOAT status. But he has a losing record against Nadal, and a lopsided one at that. The two have played 31 times since 2004, and Nadal has won 21 of those matches. Federer’s record against Nadal is a large blot on an otherwise remarkable résumé. How can you be considered the greatest player ever if you were arguably not even the best player of your own era? When I spoke with Federer at Wimbledon, he didn’t object when I noted that some feel that Nadal ought to be regarded as the finest male player of all time. “I believe we’ll never quite know,” Federer told me."

Having done that work in advance allowed Gilbert to streamline her routine backstage: she applied John Frieda Frizz-Ease Curl Reviver Styling Mousse before blow-drying, curling and parting hair far over to one side. The extensions were then glued in a diagonal band across the head, while the rest of the hair was pulled into a small side knot below the ear.

She deftly deconstructs that iconic Southern coquette and reveals her to be an ur-feminist of surprising complexity. As a reviewer and critic, Haskell has skillfully dissected celluloid characters, mining one-dimensional archetypes for insights. However, real people (herself included) prove to be more elusive targets in her new memoir, “My Brother My Sister.” As a result, the book — a chronicle of her brother’s transformation from male to female — is more of a surface skim than one might expect.

I remember the days, sittin’ on the porch with my family, singin’ and dancin’ down in Mississippi” — amuse precisely because there is nothing funny about them. Mississippi, the nation’s poorest state, was where 14-year-old Emmett Till was lynched in 1955 and the civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were murdered in 1964. It’s come to represent American racism at its most brutal — never mind that James Byrd Jr. was chained to a truck and dragged to death in Texas in 1998 or that Sean Bell and Oscar Grant III lost their lives in New York in 2006 and California in 2009, respectively.

To achieve the effect, artists traced around the perimeters of eyes with either a green pencil (Nars Eyeliner Pencil in Kalisté) or cobalt liner (Nars Blue Dahlia Larger Than Life Eyeliner; available in November), extending their ultra-fine strokes just beyond the inner and outer corners to provide graphic impact. Smudges and smears were cleaned up with a simple cotton swab while an eyebrow comb was used to sweep away any fallen particles from skin. “Marc loves when I do eyes,” Nars said of the feature he’s most known for enhancing, which often anchors the designer’s beauty look. The model Cara Delevingne was eager to try things out as she sat in the makeup chair. “I love a colored eye,” she said, pushing her tousled hair off her face. “It just adds a touch of something.” Her backstage cohort, Georgia May Jagger, concurred, saying: “People can get quite boring, so it’s good to add something different.”"

What’s on Sunday,2013-09-15,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (13, 49) FOYLE’S WAR, SERIES VII: THE ETERNITY RING This “Masterpiece Mystery!” stalwart, starring Michael Kitchen as the tenacious detective Christopher Foyle and on hiatus since 2010, picks up in 1946, when one war has ended and a new one looms as the Iron Curtain falls across Europe. Foyle, now retired, has been recruited by the British intelligence agency MI5 and must investigate the possibility of a Soviet spy network in the heart of London. In the process he learns that his former driver, Sam (Honeysuckle Weeks, above, speaking to Mr. Kitchen), has been working for one of the suspects. “As a quiet man who makes a religion of honor, responsibility and competence, Mr. Kitchen gives a performance that is, by current standards, miraculously understated,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. And though the series has advanced chronologically by only a year, “it’s a different world,” he said. “This grayer, chillier ‘Foyle’s War’ may not suit everyone, but it’s admirable, and a bit remarkable,” that its creator and writer Anthony Horowitz “has moved the show forward in a way that makes historical and dramatic sense. It wouldn’t work, of course, if Mr. Kitchen did not remain at the center, communicating an entire worldview in the way he says ‘Oh, I see’ or tells a weaselly major, ‘I’ve come to give you another opportunity to tell me the truth.’ ” "

The district court in 2011 had ruled that the state’s low carbon fuel standards discriminated against fuels produced outside California, violating Congress’s power to regulate interstate trade. Wednesday’s appeals court decision lifted a partial injunction on the state’s program. The standards were the first of their kind in the country, and regulated the carbon emitted during the production, transportation and use of fuel. Other states have since considered adopting their own limits. American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, one of the organizations that challenged the law, said it was “evaluating its options.” "

Who Made That T-Shirt?,2013-09-20,article,News,,"['T-Shirts (Apparel)', 'Fashion and Apparel', 'Inventions and Patents']",From the “bachelor undershirt” to everyday outerwear.,"In 1904, the Cooper Underwear Company ran a magazine ad announcing a new product for bachelors. In the “before” photo, a man averts his eyes from the camera as if embarrassed; he has lost all the buttons on his undershirt and has safety-pinned its flaps together. In the “after” photo, a virile gentleman sports a handlebar mustache, smokes a cigar and wears a “bachelor undershirt” stretchy enough to be pulled over the head. “No safety pins — no buttons — no needle — no thread,” ran the slogan aimed at men with no wives and no sewing skills. Someone in the U.S. Navy must have seen the logic in this, because the following year, the quartermaster’s office specified that sailors should wear undershirts with no buttons under their uniforms; soon thousands of men became acquainted with the comfort of the cotton pullover."

Our Towns,2013-09-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"The past shapes the present, and fiction melds with fact, in Peter Orner’s stories.","For the past 12 years, since his lauded “Esther Stories,” Peter Orner has been engaged in a strange, quiet and wonderful experiment. He has written four works of fiction — two novels and two story collections — all composed of canny snippets that build with subtle accumulative power to create books autobiographical in feel, if not necessarily in fact. In all but his first novel, “The Second Coming of Mavala Shikongo,” the books return to the same characters from startling vantage points; Orner is writing in spirals, moving restlessly out to embody imagined characters, but always returning to the Chicago and Fall River, Mass., family of his most frequent first-person narrator, a young man who is roughly his age. In each of his books, Orner’s crystalline sentences and his ability to pay close and sustained attention to small moments transform the ordinary elements of each story into an even more astonishing whole."

Red and Black,2013-09-20,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Blacks', 'Black People']","Three women artists, all sympathetic to the left, illuminate Harlem’s culture in the years around World War II.","In the national consciousness, Harlem has usually been defined by two eras: the artistic and cultural explosion of the 1920s, known as the Harlem Renaissance, and the drug-fueled devastation that began in the 1950s and peaked in the late ’80s. The Harlem Renaissance has been well documented by its poets, novelists and essayists, as well as by a legion of scholars in the decades since. The long, depressing ghetto years were recounted most eloquently by James Baldwin, and by lesser mortals like sociologists, memoirists, politicians, Hollywood screenwriters and rappers. Today’s whiter Harlem of multimillion-­dollar brownstones and flashy eateries is already the subject of books, blogs and innumerable magazine travel articles."
Uptown Girls,2013-09-20,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Race and Ethnicity']","White women participated in the Harlem Renaissance as philanthropists, activists, authors and patrons.","Time hasn’t been kind to the white women who participated in the Harlem Renaissance. As philanthropists and activists, authors and patrons, they sought a place for themselves in that remarkable outpouring of African-American art during the 1920s and ’30s. Some, constrained by social expectations, effaced the records of their work. Others made it difficult for historians to treat them with much seriousness. What, after all, can we do with someone like Nancy Cunard, a British steamship heiress raised on a remote English estate, who felt no shame in proclaiming “I speak as if I were a Negro myself”?"
The Unquiet Americans,2013-09-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Bob Shacochis’s novel of conflict and corruption spans five decades and four countries.,"Like most serious American novels about war, “The Woman Who Lost Her Soul” wants to explain the country in its entirety. Of course, that’s a tall order, but Bob Shacochis doesn’t lack for ambition — his novel is about not one but two contemporary wars, both of them endless: the war on terror and the war on drugs. It’s a novel about the United States that takes place largely outside the United States, if you discount the many scenes set on various world-renowned American golf courses. Although the book strives to paint a full portrait of its panoply of complicated characters — both in warrior mode and on the home front — the problem with endless war in a narrative is that the writer ends up not with “War and Peace” but with war and . . . more war. One follows from battle to battle, from firefight to firefight, from political assassination to terror attack to revenge-taking, without resolution, because the endless war can conceive of no resolution: resolution, which makes a narrative complete, is not part of this story."
Down and Out,2013-09-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Sue Grafton’s “W Is for Wasted,” a homeless man is found dead on the beach and the sleuth Kinsey Millhone meets his three disinherited children.","Instead of dreading the day Sue Grafton reaches the end of the alphabet, her faithful readers should be concerned about her plans for a new decade. It’s still the materialistic 1980s in W IS FOR WASTED (Marian Wood/Putnam, $28.95), so Kinsey Millhone, the well-nigh immortal sleuth in this enduring series, still has time to play her rebel role simply by living a spartan existence in a world of greedy narcissists. How sweet it is to see the California private eye back in her garage apartment, hanging out with her 88-year-old landlord, wearing jeans and boots and pulling out a single dress to get her through formal occasions. It’s also fun to watch her at work, taking notes on index cards, typing reports on a Smith-Corona and — here’s what really matters — communicating with people face to face."
Her Story,2013-09-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The woman raped by Roman Polanski when she was 13 tells what happened then and in the long aftermath.,"Samantha Geimer says she really wants you to leave her alone. Really. She’s a 50-year-old woman now, dividing her time between Hawaii and Nevada with her husband and three sons. But 36 years ago in Hollywood, when she was only 13, she was plied with Champagne and a quaa­lude, photographed topless, and raped by the 43-year-old Roman Polanski. And ever since, her privacy has been busted. Any time Polanski is in the news, Geimer is once again thrown back into reliving her invaded girlhood, an unwilling principal player in a story never satisfactorily concluded. And Polanski is in the news often, since the artistically impressive, Oscar-winning, Polish-French director who made “Chinatown,” “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Pianist” fled the United States in 1978 before final sentencing. The wrath of American justice, affronted as much by his defiance as by his crime, awaits him if he ever returns. It’s a story that has become grimy with symbolism about Hollywood privilege, 1970s California indulgence, imperfect parenting, judicial pandering and inconsistency, tortured creative temperament, and the rights of rape victims.

Losing Her Religion,2013-09-20,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Nicole Hardy examines her wavering Mormon faith.,"Augustine famously asked God to grant him chastity but not yet. In “Confessions of a Latter-day Virgin,” her account of remaining chaste and Mormon well into her 30s, Nicole Hardy pleads with God to just take it from her already — because if he wants her to wait until marriage for sex, as her church demands, he’s going to have to toss her something she’s been unable to find on her own. As she writes in typically winking fashion after a grueling bout of online Mormon dating: “If the kind of man I want exists within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he is rare, not unlike the endangered red panda of the Himalayas. Show me an LDS man who’s wickedly funny, politically liberal, brighter than the average bear and uncommitted to 1950s gender roles, and I will show you the shaggy tail and waddling gait of the Ailurus fulgens, its mischievous mouth rife with bamboo.”"

It is the failure of the society (according to liberals) or of the poor themselves (according to conservatives) or of institutions and individuals together in a complex combination (according to centrists). Poverty violates core American values. It challenges the American dream’s promise of prosperity for anyone who works hard, a faith central to the national ethic.

(HBO) HITCHCOCK (2012) Anthony Hopkins, buried in a fat suit and facial prosthetics, summons the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock during the making of “Psycho” in this biopic, directed by Sacha Gervasi and based on a book by Stephen Rebello. But Hitchcock isn’t merely taken with the inspiration behind his perverse shocker: Robert Bloch’s 1959 novel about the crimes of Ed Gein, a serial killer in Wisconsin who adorned his home with human body parts and walked around in the skin of his female victims. Hitchcock becomes possessed, enduring sleepless nights and, at the same time, marital troubles with his wife and adviser, Alma (Helen Mirren, above with Mr. Hopkins), who is dramatically unhappy about his fixation on blondes — in this case, Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). “The real Hitchcock’s great flaw, apparently, was that he was at once a genius and a private man, a combination that has allowed some writers and filmmakers to have their insultingly imaginative way with him,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while “The Girl,” on HBO, “painted him as a pathetic sexual predator,” this film “takes a lighter, more strenuously comic if patronizing approach to the director,” she said. “It’s fluff. But while its dim fantasies about Hitchcock and the association of genius with psychosis can be written off as silly, they also smack of spiteful jealousy.”"

In other words, we’re on course toward a catastrophe. "

(Some of which are ongoing on the Senate floor at the moment.) The others in that group — Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Marco Rubio — have tried to initiate real policy debates and shift the party’s stance on major issues: Rubio with immigration, Paul (and Lee) with foreign policy and civil liberties, Paul with drug policy and criminal justice, and now Lee with family policy and tax reform. But not Cruz: He’s defining himself as a national figure not by taking positions on questions that divide his party, but by picking issues where the party is basically united — Obamacare, gun control, taxes — and playing the maximalist while promising the moon. (Tellingly, on the specific fronts where the others have staked out some legitimately bold stances, the Texas senator has mostly tap-danced — he’s “somewhere between Rand Paul and John McCain” on foreign policy, somewhere in the middle of his party on immigration, and so on.) Paul, Rubio and now Lee are all trying to move the party, and conservatism, in a particular direction; Cruz is telling conservatives to fight harder, but otherwise to stay exactly where they are."

In “The Crazy Ones,” a new series at 9, Robin Williams stars as a childlike advertising genius whose behavior might normally earn him a pink slip — if he weren’t a boss. Sarah Michelle Gellar is Sydney, his daughter, partner and grounding force who, in this premiere episode, helps him persuade Kelly Clarkson to record a familiar jingle, with a twist, for their client. “Watching Mr. Williams return to the kind of improvisation-style routines that made him famous in the 1970s is bittersweet, like watching Jimmy Connors play tennis again: they are still impressive, but audiences can’t help recalling how much more elastic and powerful they were at their peak,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. In “Two and a Half Men,” at 9:30, Alan (Jon Cryer) is shocked when Charlie’s long-lost 25-year-old daughter, Jenny (Amber Tamblyn), shows up at the beach house of Walden (Ashton Kutcher) and reveals that she likes everything her father liked, including women."

The council also discussed the National Marine Fisheries Service’s decision this summer not to implement all of the measures the council approved last year to protect Atlantic herring, citing funding issues; the group tabled a motion to prohibit midwater trawling in the region until those rules are put into place.

Udayan, the younger of two brothers in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta (now Kolkata), gets drawn into a radical left movement called Naxalism, its name derived from Naxalbari, a tiny village to the north of Calcutta where impoverished peasants rose up against the police and landlords in 1967, sparking off dreams of a nationwide insurgency that would replicate Mao’s earlier revolution in China. But Udayan is killed by the police, and his older brother, Subhash, apolitical, passive, but responsible, returns home from graduate school in the United States to console his parents. Finding himself confronted with his brother’s pregnant widow, Gauri, and her ill treatment by his grieving parents, Subhash marries her and brings her to Rhode Island.

Scientific Americans,2013-09-27,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Andrea Barrett’s stories are set near the turn of the 20th century, at moments of intellectual and historical change.","“You have turned your back on the common man, on their elementary needs and their restricted time and their intelligence,” H. G. Wells wrote in a 1928 letter to James Joyce, after reading sections of “Finnegans Wake.” “Do I get much pleasure from this work? No. Do I feel I am getting something new and illuminating as I do when I read . . . Pavlov’s badly written book on Conditioned Reflexes? No.” In other words, science involves new illuminations, messiness, even creative destruction, but literature is something else entirely: the common reader needs clarity, simplicity and a hopeful outlook, a sense that, in Wells’s words, progress is “not inevitable but interesting and possible.”"

Call them “fellows.” Hang identity cards, with their mug shots petrified in plastic, around their necks. Appoint a chairman whose paranoia and megalomania recall, in madcap picayune, the dictators who tortured and imprisoned many of them. Outfit the house with security cameras that scan the corridors, the surveillance tapes complemented by the human watchfulness of ever-­solicitous volunteers.

The A.C.A. requires companies with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance to those working 30 hours or more a week, or pay a penalty. The theory spun by Republicans is that employers are maneuvering to escape that penalty by reducing the hours of most workers to below the 30 hour threshold. The critics say that’s why many job-seekers can’t find full-time work and many job holders are finding their hours reduced. As Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on the floor of the Senate recently, “Obamacare is a big reason we’re turning into a nation of part-time workers.”"

What’s On Saturday,2013-09-28,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Showtime) LINCOLN (2012) Daniel Day-Lewis, below, in the role that won him his third Oscar for best actor, portrays Abraham Lincoln as he struggles to abolish slavery while the Civil War rages in this drama directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner. Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, his wife, who is grieving the death of their son Willie; Tommy Lee Jones is the abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, who, along with his fellow Republican radicals, is demanding a vote on a Constitutional amendment; Hal Holbrook is Preston Blair, a party conservative who prefers peace talks with the Confederacy that evade a decisive solution. And David Strathairn is William Seward, Lincoln’s secretary of state, who is willing to trade patronage jobs for votes in Congress. “The genius of ‘Lincoln,’ finally, lies in its vision of politics as a noble, sometimes clumsy dialectic of the exalted and the mundane,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Our habit of argument, someone said recently, is a mark of our liberty, and Mr. Kushner, whose love of passionate, exhaustive disputation is unmatched in the modern theater, fills nearly every scene with wonderful, maddening talk. Mr. Spielberg’s best art often emerges in passages of wordlessness, when the images speak for themselves, and the way he composes his pictures and cuts between them endows the speeches and debates with emotional force, and reminds us of what is at stake.” “Lincoln,” he added, “is a rough and noble democratic masterpiece — an omen, perhaps, that movies for the people shall not perish from the earth.” "

The Progress Against Global Poverty,2013-09-28,article,News,,[],Readers comment on my column about the remarkable progress against global poverty and disease.,"My Sunday column looks at something that has been happening over time so that we haven’t given it the attention it deserves–even though it may be the most important thing going on in history right now. I’m referring to the decline of extreme poverty. When I was in college, a majority of the world’s people lived in extreme poverty, and the proportion will have dropped to virtually zero by the time I retire. That’s astounding progress, and it’s also reflected in mortality rates. When I was in college, around 15 million kids a year were dying annually. Now the figure has dropped to a bit more than 6 million, and in my lifetime the figure will drop below 1 million. Illiteracy is also on its way out. Look, we will still face immense problems — the US is a good example of how even a rich country can have a severe problem with an impoverished underclass — and some kinds of poverty will be with us for decades or centuries to come. But the kind I’ve reported on in so many places, where illiterate parents have eight children who die young and are always on the edge of famine or disability, that kind of extreme poverty may be on its way out, along with river blindness, malaria, trachoma and other ailments."

Pat McGrath kept the face nude and dewy — adding that dewy is the new matte — and focused on a “strong, boyish brow,” using a variety of brow pencils and powders. “We’re making the brows darker, filling them in,” she said. “We’re taking out the arches.” To experiment with a strong brow off the runway, she recommended using products only one or two shades darker than one’s natural brow color. The hairstyle, which Luigi Murenu created and described as “a bit masculine in the front,” also erred on the side of slightly subversive. The heightened roots were shellacked back into rockabilly stiffness, while the length of the hair was flat-ironed stick straight. Murenu summed it up as “a street look but more glamorized. It’s cool, it’s punky” — not unlike the collection. "

What’s On Sunday,2013-09-29,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (Showtime) MASTERS OF SEX Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan star as Dr. William H. Masters and his collaborator, Virginia Johnson, the groundbreaking researchers who sought to demystify arousal during the dark ages before the sexual revolution, in this new series based on Thomas Maier’s biography “Masters of Sex.” He was a brilliant, obsessed and often imperious surgeon determined to make his name by decoding the physiology of pleasure. She was a former nightclub singer and sexually liberated woman with a desire for a career and a deft touch with people. Together they spent thousands of hours watching others masturbate and copulate while wired to monitors. They also had lots of sex with each other, though Johnson told Mr. Maier that at first she didn’t want Masters — she wanted a job. Eventually, Masters left his wife to marry Johnson; they, too, later divorced. Though it takes liberties with facts and interpretation, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times, the show “does an elegant job of reframing their strange, complicated and at times deeply cynical partnership into a twisted but intriguing love story.” It’s enjoyable, she said, “mainly because the actors are so good. Michael Sheen (above, with Nicholle Tom), who is best known for playing likable charmers like Tony Blair and David Frost, is convincing as a driven and stilted egotist, a man who has compassion for patients and almost no time for his infertile, unhappy wife, Libby (Caitlin FitzGerald). As Virginia, a twice-divorced single mother of two, Lizzy Caplan (‘Party Down,’ ‘Bachelorette’) is dazzling in a role that isn’t easy: Virginia is sensual and sexy, strong-willed and good-humored, a modern woman trying to forge her own way in a world that is still backward about sex and the role of women.” And, like sex, Ms. Stanley added, “ ‘Masters of Sex’ gets better as it goes on.”"
