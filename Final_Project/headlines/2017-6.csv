"Review: In ‘Dawson City: Frozen Time,’ Early Movies Lost and Found",2017-06-08,article,Review,,"['Movies', 'Documentary Films and Programs']",A lot of future moguls got their start in one remote Yukon town. And an amazing amount of film history was left behind.,"The filmmaker Bill Morrison customarily constructs his movies with footage from other films that are very old and whose prints are very worn. No matter the ostensible subject of his individual pictures, the overarching theme is impermanence; his best-known work, “Decasia” (2002), is an artfully edited assemblage of found footage whose visual appeal is the crumbling of the film emulsion itself. So it’s a bit of a shock that “Dawson City: Frozen Time” begins with a brightly colored, completely intact clip from a television show about baseball in which Mr. Morrison appears, talking to an enthusiastic host about newly discovered footage related to the Black Sox baseball-betting scandal of 1919."

The story concerns Jack Zeller (Christopher Denham), a photographer with post-traumatic stress disorder who returns to his Midwestern hometown from a combat assignment in the Middle East, only to receive a camera whose pictures, when developed, depict murder victims within Jack’s compositions.

Naomi Klein Is Sick of Benevolent Billionaires,2017-06-14,article,News,,['Nepotism'],The Canadian author and critic of capitalism lays down her case against President Trump’s wealth-and-power brand.,"Your book “No Is Not Enough” frames Donald Trump’s impunity as a type of branding. How does that help explain him? He’s a culmination of many dangerous trends in the culture, especially the triumph of the idea that a successful corporation is first and foremost selling an idea of itself and a sense of belonging and identity to its customers. In the late ’80s, you saw brands start to sell the idea, the sense of belonging, first. That primacy of the brand does a lot to explain Trump, and how he has developed this intimate relationship with his base, why they expect so little of him and why he gets away with what he gets away with, because the rules of branding are really simple: Be true to your brand. The problem with Donald Trump is that he went and designed a brand that is entirely amoral."

This surprised me when I first moved to the country more than a decade ago. I expected God and money to be kept separate, at least outwardly, more in keeping with the discreet, cash-in-envelopes Christian churches of my youth. Yet around the exterior of the tiny, seafoam green 19th-century mosque across the street from my Istanbul home, I discovered an array of shops: a locksmith, a market, a kebab joint, a teahouse and a rotisserie vendor whose delicious, buttery chickens twirled all day outside. One of the imams who preached at the mosque was a part-time real estate agent. The attempted military coup last July lasted until the wee hours of the night, yet my little green mosque was, as usual, open and ready early the next morning for prayer; the locksmith whose shop was part of the complex waddled in by 9 a.m., and the happy blend of prayer and small-time hustle in Istanbul continued unabated."

Sam Gold Brings His Touch to ‘Hamlet’,2017-06-14,article,News,,['Theater'],"After a bracing revival of “The Glass Menagerie” this spring, and last year’s “Othello,” Mr. Gold takes on another Shakespeare drama.","The director Sam Gold has made his name with contemporary plays, and of the two shows he brought to Broadway this spring, only the new one — Lucas Hnath’s “A Doll’s House, Part 2” — caught fire with critics. The other, his bracingly stripped-down revival of “The Glass Menagerie,” was a hard sell — coming too soon, it seemed, after John Tiffany’s stunner of a production. Yet Mr. Gold’s interpretation, which gave us a lovely Laura (Madison Ferris) in a wheelchair, made sense of that play in a way that felt powerfully necessary. It succeeded at the job of every revival: justifying its own existence. Now Mr. Gold, who staged a starry “Othello” Off Broadway last fall, has a “Hamlet” on the horizon. With Oscar Isaac as Hamlet and Charlayne Woodard as Gertrude, it begins previews on Tuesday, June 20, at the Public. What dreams may come? We’ll see. (publictheater.org)"

My idea of a nightmare is people standing very elegantly dressed in a room with a drink in their hand. I’m just like, urghh!”"

Whose Fault Is It Anyway? Three Books on the Shifting Nature of Responsibility in American Politics,2017-06-30,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],How responsibility came to mean accountability — and why that matters for issues of justice and welfare reform.,"At some point in the last half-century, American politicians started talking about responsibility in a new way. Where “responsibility” once referred to the duties of the nation to its citizens, or of the citizens to the nation, or of fellow citizens to one another, it now came to mean the obligations of the individual to himself. Responsibility was personal responsibility. You might date the beginning of this shift to 1968, when Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, announced in a speech at the Republican National Convention that it was time to stop blaming “society” for people’s failings and to start accepting that “each individual is accountable for his actions.” You might date the completion of this shift to 1993, when President Bill Clinton exhorted Americans in his first Inaugural Address to “demand responsibility from all” and “to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing.”"
