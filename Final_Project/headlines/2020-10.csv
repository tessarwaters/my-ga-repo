A Foosball Table That Elevates the Level of Play,2020-10-02,article,News,,['Interior Design and Furnishings'],"Louis Vuitton’s design includes a textured leather exterior and hand-painted, aluminum-cast players.","Perhaps surprisingly for a game redolent of fraternity-house basements, foosball has a sophisticated and mysterious provenance. Referred to by the British, straightforwardly, as table football, and by the French, adorably, as le baby-foot (the term “foosball” comes from the German word for soccer), it was, by some accounts, created in the 1930s by a French automobile engineer, Lucien Rosengart. The Spanish anarchist and publisher Alejandro Finisterre also claimed to have invented futbolín while recovering from injuries sustained in the Spanish Civil War, and the Englishman Harold Searles Thornton filed a patent for a similar setup in 1923. The French fashion and leather goods company Louis Vuitton, however, is less concerned with establishing the republic’s title to le baby-foot than in designing the most aesthetically pleasing version imaginable. Offered in seven different finishes, including leathers such as the brand’s textured Epi in colors like cyan and pistachio, as well as the iconic logoed canvas pictured here, the table’s hand-painted, custom-matched aluminum-cast players are modeled on the hotel porter character from Vuitton’s 1921 advertising campaign. Foosball’s origins may not be certain, but this is: You won’t find this particular amusement in the corner of some subterranean rec room.

A Tiffany Necklace That Transcends Time,2020-10-02,article,News,,"['Gold', 'Diamonds', 'Jewels and Jewelry', 'Design']","The diamonds perched atop Elsa Peretti’s fluid gold mesh collar, which the house recently reimagined, resemble droplets of dew.","“I have the feeling of having to prove I exist … through houses and objects,” the jewelry designer Elsa Peretti once said. “I have to crystallize a form.” Peretti’s career grew out of her chance travels as a model in the late ’60s and early ’70s, when she was a muse to Helmut Newton and Halston. After stumbling upon a very tiny flower vase made of sterling silver at a flea market, which she wanted to wear as a necklace, she began sketching ideas with a silversmith in Spain. Her early creations were instinctive and macabre, inspired by animal skulls, scorpions and even X-rays of her own skeleton. In 1974, she joined Tiffany & Co. as a designer, where her sinuous and sculptural pieces — such as the Bean, Diamonds by the Yard and the Open Heart — quickly became signatures of the 1837-founded American jewelry house. That same year, Peretti traveled throughout Jaipur, India, and the city’s glittering light inspired her to begin working with mesh. Halston debuted a gold mesh bra and scarf designed by Peretti for Tiffany in his fall 1975 runway collection, which she produced on old machinery that had been used to make handbags in fine metal netting and chain mail in the early 20th century. The mesh designs were a hit: “Tiffany was swamped with calls from people dying to get a gold bra,” Peretti recalled."

War’s effects have been so profound that to leave it out is to ignore one of the great forces, along with geography, resources, economics, ideas, and social and political changes, which have shaped human development and changed history.

11 New Books We Recommend This Week,2020-10-08,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"The security state and America’s intelligence apparatus loom large in this week’s book recommendations, with two historical considerations of the C.I.A. (“The Spymasters” and “The Quiet Americans”) joining an insider’s look at the Mueller investigation (“Where Law Ends”), an account of the drug kingpin El Chapo and his capture (“El Jefe”) and a novel whose writer protagonist is certain he has come under surveillance (“Red Pill”). We also like Claudia Rankine’s gratifyingly hard-to-categorize new book about race, “Just Us,” Tom Philpott’s exposé of industrial farming, “Perilous Bounty,” and a provocative collection of essays, “To Make Their Own Way in the World,” about the so-called Zealy daguerreotypes, the first-known photographs of slaves. In fiction, our recommendations include Yishai Sarid’s novel “The Memory Monster” and two very different novels about sisters: Edmund White’s “A Saint From Texas” and Daisy Johnson’s macabre Gothic throwback, “Sisters.”"

The Evolution of the Onion Sandwich,2020-10-14,article,News,,"['Onions', 'Sandwiches', 'Cooking and Cookbooks']",It was once known as brioche en surprise. Then James Beard got hold of it.,"Long before James Beard was famous for championing American foods and mentoring a generation of chefs, long before he was an immediately recognizable celebrity, he was sick and tired of not being famous. Sick and tired of working in kitchens, unseen and uncelebrated, stalling out while the people around him came up. In 1940, working in obscurity as a caterer, he lifted a recipe from his colleagues Irma Rhode and her brother Bill Rhode — known as New York’s king of hors d’oeuvres — and published it as his own. It was a cute cocktail sandwich of soft, buttery bread and finely sliced onion called brioche en surprise, a hit at the events he and the Rhodes had worked together. But as Beard became more famous, the sandwich got a new, unofficial name: James Beard’s onion sandwich. Beard earned (along with a reputation for chronic, unapologetic plagiarism) his own nickname, the Dean of American Cookery. It was a good nickname, a strong nickname, though in suggesting a kind of elite prep school tucked away from the real world, it also gave away some truths about the small circle of people defining American food: They were insular, petty and competitive. And if Beard was their dean — a champion of American regional ingredients and the cooks who supported them — he was also a fragile and sometimes predatory influencer, an outsider aching for companionship and financial success."

On Recent Criticism of The 1619 Project,2020-10-16,article,News,,"['Black People', 'Blacks']",A response from our editor.,"The 1619 Project, which was conceived of and led by Nikole Hannah-Jones, a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine, advances a bold claim: that the date when the first enslaved Africans arrived in the English colonies that would become the United States — August of 1619 — can be regarded as the nation’s birth or point of origin. Why does the project propose this? In part because, as its essays show, the system of slavery and oppression that began on this date has led to so many of the problems that define our past and our present; in part because, as Hannah-Jones argues, the struggle against this system of oppression has been a pivotal freedom movement unfolding across many generations to advance progress for American society as a whole; and in part to advance the case that, as the heroes of both of these stories, Black Americans, whose presence in the English colonies that would become the United States began on this date, should occupy a central role in American history."

According to “The Gardener’s Companion to Medicinal Plants,” a 2016 guide to home remedies, the study of herbal medicine can be traced back 5,000 years, to the Sumerians of southern Mesopotamia, who listed the names of hundreds of plants — including fennel, mint, thyme, sage, myrtle and marjoram — on clay tablets that were later rediscovered in what is now Iraq. Modern scholars believe that the Sumerians used what they grew in medicinal preparations such as tea infusions that were intended to treat ailments from toothache to inflammation. And in England, says Timothy d’Offay, a tea importer and the founder of Postcard Teas in London, tea gardens have their origins in the work of 17th-century apothecaries such as Nicholas Culpeper, a botanist and physician whose encyclopedia of herbs, “The English Physician,” has remained in print since it was first published in 1653. “The apothecaries’ focus was on the use of herbs in healing,” explains d’Offay. “It was really the beginnings of modern medicine.

I learned from the photos in midcentury cookbooks how fresh anchovies and piles of sunbaked sea salt are harvested in Sicily. When I read “Honey From a Weed,” I sopped up the flavors of Patience Gray’s tales of cooking off the land while chasing marble across the Mediterranean with her sculptor beau. From a handful of single-subject books I still treasure, I spent hours learning about the regional differences in pasta sauces and the individual histories of dozens, if not hundreds, of pasta shapes I hoped to one day taste. I grew to love the hot-blooded, tradition-protecting Italian culinary sensibility I got to know through these books — so much so that I learned the language and eventually moved to the country."
