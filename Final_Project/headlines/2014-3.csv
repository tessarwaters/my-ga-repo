(Showtime) THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012) Naomi Watts received an Oscar nomination for her role as Maria, an Englishwoman living in Japan, who is spending Christmas 2004 with her husband (Ewan McGregor) and three sons at a luxurious beach resort in Thailand when the tsunami hits. Maria is washed inland with her oldest son (Tom Holland, above, with Ms. Watts), leaving her badly injured and unable to find the rest of her family. “Survivors are also witnesses, and ‘The Impossible’ shows us, through the eyes of one unbelievably lucky family, some terrible things, including mangled bodies and parents in despair,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this second feature from the Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, based on a real-life account, which uses digital imagery, sound design and editing techniques to recreate both the violence and desolation that resulted from the natural disaster. “But there is a troubling complacency and a lack of compassion in ‘The Impossible,’ which is less an examination of mass destruction than the tale of a spoiled holiday.

The images are cropped so tightly that they resemble female pubic hair. “By using humor, you make a connection,” says the 36-year-old French artist, who has explored — and upended — other beauty and gender tropes, including the masochistic nature of pedicures (in one of her short films she took a cheese grater to her heels) and the male ideal (satirized in a photography project that centered on the anatomy of Greek classical statues). Berthon-Moine knows her work isn’t for everyone. “You have to accept that people will like it or hate it and that is fine,” she says. “Art will not change the world but it can shift the way we look at it.”"

What packs a surprising punch out on the street can often feel like getting hammered with the pious and the obvious in a stage setting. That’s a major drawback of “Hobo Grunt Cycle,” a work by the Lone Wolf Tribe founder Kevin Augustine at Dixon Place through March 15, which marries extraordinary life-size puppets and Chaplinesque antics to show how we use soldiers, fighting pit bulls and clowns for our own various gratifications, then kick them to the curb, wounded and forgotten. Augustine, who possesses formidable puppet-making and pantomime talents, is our main hobo clown — a genre, we learn, at the bottom of the clown “chain of command,” well below patrician whiteface and the middle-rank, red-nosed “Auguste.” He is not only forced to become a military fighting machine, trained to shoot and bayonet to kill (the work employs considerable World War I imagery), he also tenderly nurses a badly injured pit bull, another creature raised to fight on command, and even helps a delicate little (puppet) bird convalesce. Amid all this arrive a few theatrically unbearable moments. At one point, we hear two parents, on the other side of a locked door, as they wail for their (puppet) war-vet son, an amputee and PTSD sufferer, who has apparently killed himself in his bedroom.

Five Theses on Ukraine,2014-03-04,article,News,,"['Cold War Era', 'Defense and Military Forces', 'International Relations', 'United States International Relations']",The implications of Vladimir Putin’s Crimean adventure.,"1) It probably wasn’t rhetorically helpful, but John Kerry was entirely correct when he called Vladimir Putin’s quasi-invasion of Ukraine the work of “somebody who is acting out of weakness.” Putin’s aggression doesn’t undermine anything I wrote a week ago about the limits of Russian power and the essential implausibility of the Kremlin’s grand ambitions; this gambit is a salvage operation following a major political setback, not a plausible stepping-stone toward some sweeping long-term objective. The echoes of earlier Russian aggressions are real, but the comparison to Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Hungary in 1956 should be illuminating: In those cases, Russia was projecting power well beyond its borders, and using force to keep a relatively-vast sphere of influence intact, whereas in this case it’s projecting power … in the Russian-speaking regions of a former Soviet republic/czarist province. You can make the case that Putin is playing as well as he can with a losing hand, or you can make the case that he’s out of touch with reality and stumbling into an epic disaster. But either way, what we’re witnessing isn’t the re-emergence of Russia as a major geopolitical threat to the United States and our allies, unless by “major geopolitical threat” you mean “weakened ex-empire struggling to control its own periphery.”"

Of the many things the College Board does — take part in research, develop education policy, create curriculums — it is perhaps most recognized as the organization that administers the SAT, and Perelman was one of the exam’s harshest and most relentless critics. Since 2005, when the College Board added an essay to the SAT (raising the total possible score from 1,600 to 2,400), Perelman had been conducting research that highlighted what he believed were the inherent absurdities in how the essay questions were formulated and scored. His earliest findings showed that length, more than any other factor, correlated with a high score on the essay. More recently, Perelman coached 16 students who were retaking the test after having received mediocre scores on the essay section. He told them that details mattered but factual accuracy didn’t. “You can tell them the War of 1812 began in 1945,” he said. He encouraged them to sprinkle in little-used but fancy words like “plethora” or “myriad” and to use two or three preselected quotes from prominent figures like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, regardless of whether they were relevant to the question asked. Fifteen of his pupils scored higher than the 90th percentile on the essay when they retook the exam, he said."

The ruling, which said that the rights of the former officer, Gen. Ilker Basbug, who served as military chief of staff from 2008 to 2010, had been violated, paved the way for his possible release from an Istanbul prison. The Constitutional Court said the lower court that held the five-year trial failed to publish its detailed reasoning for its verdict and send it to the appeals court, obstructing the defendant’s right to an appeal and violating a constitutional clause concerning personal freedom. The ruling could also be used as a precedent for the release of many of the more than 270 defendants who spent several years in prison before their convictions last year in the case known as the Ergenekon affair. The government’s prosecution of that case was seen as an effort to curb the role of Turkey’s military in politics, but it was also criticized for ensnaring people who were opponents of the government, including politicians, academics, journalists and writers.

What’s On Friday,2014-03-07,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: FOOD IN THE MOVIES A visual feast begins with “Eat Drink Man Woman” (1994), above, Ang Lee’s Oscar-nominated drama for best foreign-language film about a father, Mr. Chu (Sihung Lung) — the greatest chef in Taipei — who has lost his joie de vivre, and his three beautiful star-crossed daughters (Chien-Lien Wu, Kuei-Mei-Yang and Yu-Wen Wang), who cannot escape his spell. Tensions are so high that at their extravagant Sunday dinners, the family can barely eat. And so he begins to supply spectacular lunches to the daughter of a family friend, who is too young to realize that his cooking is flawed: He has lost the use of his taste buds. “Wonderfully seductive, and nicely knowing about all of its characters’ appetites, ‘Eat Drink Man Woman’ makes for an uncomplicatedly pleasant experience,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “This film’s use of food is both voluptuous and serious, amplifying the story even as it offers an irresistible diversion. The film succeeds in presenting Mr. Chu’s intricate cooking (rendered for the camera by three amazingly artful chefs) as an expression of larger traditionalism and as an endangered art.” Of the title, she added: “ ‘Food and sex,’ one character says succinctly, amplifying that four-ideogram phrase. ‘Basic human desires. Can’t avoid them.’ ” In “Mostly Martha” (2002), at 10:15, Martha (Martina Gedeck), a single, workaholic chef in Hamburg, Germany, finds her carefully organized life in disarray when she must care for her dead sister’s 8-year-old daughter (Maxime Foerste). Enter Mario, the Italian sous-chef (Sergio Castellitto) who can charm everyone but Martha. “The movie succeeds because the writer and director, Sandra Nettelbeck, seems as obsessive as her titular heroine,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times. “The final confection is extremely enjoyable, though a few degrees shy of perfection.”"

Before entering the American zone, he buried his gun and, while sheltering in an attic, hid letters from his new wife urging him in coded language to desert. During a home renovation in the 1980s, the bundle of letters was discovered, hidden in a wall, and returned to the doctor’s family. The correspondence revealed the trials of a young woman raising the three sons from her husband’s first marriage.

A Walk Through Time,2014-03-07,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Patrick Leigh Fermor’s European travel trilogy draws to a close.,"In the winter of 1933, an 18-year-old named Patrick Leigh Fermor set out from the Hook of Holland to cross Europe on foot. His goal was Istanbul, which he bookishly insisted on calling Constantinople. He had little more in his rucksack than a volume of Horace and a few blank notebooks. He also had a bad reputation: The masters who expelled him from school — for a flirtation with a local girl — saw only “a dangerous mixture of sophistication and recklessness.” He spent the next year charming his way through a doomed prewar landscape of landed aristocrats, feudal peasants and benevolent monks, sleeping alternately in schlosses and hayricks. It was a journey that would become legendary, not so much for the extraordinary things he saw and recorded as for his prose — an utterly unique, hybrid vehicle that combines youthful exuberance with a dense, dauntingly erudite display of verbal artifice. Unlike most authors of travel literature (a rattlebag genre that doesn’t really do him justice) Leigh Fermor does not confine his role to that of camera obscura. He builds dense whorls of wordplay to echo the carvings in an old church door; he slips into baroque historical fantasias, scattering a shrapnel of words like “gabions,” “hydromel,” “eyot” and “swingle­trees” at the unsuspecting reader. In between salvos, there are moments of ferocious humor and quiet, lyrical beauty."

Yes, there are days when the waves are passably good, and rare days when they are powerful and shapely, but that’s true of breaks in the Great Lakes and Italy. What sets Far Rockaway apart is that it’s a subway ride away from Manhattan, a fact recently rediscovered by a younger crop of culture workers who took up surfing and by dint of beginner’s zeal have added a wholesome, sun-spangled dimension to the hard-soled, mean-streets experience of life in New York, retrofitting Far Rockaway with smoothie stands and half-million-dollar surf shacks among the grim low-income high-rises."

Reviewing “Bark” on the cover of the Book Review a few weeks ago, David Gates noted that Moore shares Vladimir Nabokov’s affinity for obsessive wordplay, although her outlook is darker; she is, he wrote, “the most Beckettian of Nabokovians.” What Gates didn’t mention (but surely knew) was that “Bark” contains a direct tribute to Nabokov: Moore’s story “Referential,” about a couple visiting the woman’s son in a mental hospital, borrows its premise and some of its language from Nabokov’s 1948 story “Signs and Symbols,” in which the patient “imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence.” A story about a story about a man who thinks everything is about him: How’s that for referential?"

She grew up amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood in the ’80s, the youngest in a long family line of legendary actors, and made her first television appearance before she was even a year old. But they share an almost obsessive love for movies, particularly black-and-white films made decades ago. It’s this connection that makes Osborne and Barrymore light up together as the host and co-host, respectively, of TCM’s “The Essentials.” The show, which premiered in 2001 and airs on Saturday nights, puts timeless, classic films in the spotlight with commentary and fun bits of trivia supplied by the hosts (in the past those duties have been taken up by everyone from Rob Reiner to Alec Baldwin).

Art Matters | Darren Bader’s Video Contribution to the 2014 Whitney Biennial,2014-03-10,article,News,,"['Art', 'Whitney Biennial']","Every two weeks, T exclusively presents a new installation from the artist’s video series entitled “Things I’m (Probably) Not Going to Get Done for the Biennial.”","Nearly three months ago, Darren Bader approached T in the hope that we’d host his off-site video contribution to this year’s Whitney Biennial. The plan, he explained, was to post a series of fake news stories on our website — without attributing them to him or the Whitney, and without even a wink to suggest that something funny was afoot. This idea got shut down. But there were plenty of others. The New York-based artist wanted to produce an editorial that paired celebrities with everyday objects, which echoed a show he staged in Los Angeles last summer at Blum & Poe. “Bryan Cranston and sleeping bag,” was one suggested match. “Patricia Arquette with weather balloon.” Another thought was to photograph things that rhyme, such as boule and stool, or the occult Baal and the actor Nick Stahl. In the end, time and budget constraints forced him to shelve (twelve, helve — the game gets inside you) his original slate of ideas, but Bader made the most of a trying situation. What follows is the first video from his new series, “Things I’m (Probably) Not Going to Get Done for the Biennial.” About the videos, which will run here exclusively through the duration of the Biennial, Bader has this to say: “I have ideas. You have ideas. Maybe some of them are the same.” More likely than not, this last part is untrue."

Earl Ray Tomblin said he was concerned about the constitutionality of a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which the State Legislature passed over the weekend.

The Supreme Court in January refused to hear an appeal of a lower court’s decision to strike down an Arizona law banning most abortions after 20 weeks. In Roe v. Wade in 1973, the high court said women have a right to an abortion until the point of fetal viability, generally seen as 24 weeks. “The abortion bill obviously is one that causes me some concern because even the legislative attorneys and others said they feel this bill is unconstitutional,” Governor Tomblin said in a statement.

The court said the men should be released because the Parliament recently reduced the maximum detention period before a conviction to five years, and the prisoners had already been detained longer than that. The court order followed the release of a former army chief last week after the Constitutional Court’s ruling critical of the conduct of the recently abolished Special Court that carried out the Ergenekon trial. The trial, which lasted five years, prompted criticism at home and abroad, with several international organizations describing the prosecution of the more than 200 suspects as unfair, with unnecessary arrests, secret witnesses and disputes over evidence. Some Turkish analysts characterized Monday’s releases as part of a bid by the government to increase its popularity before local elections in two weeks and gain the upper hand in a power struggle with a pro-Islamic network influential in the judiciary and the police.

Nepal: Push to Open Peaks to Climbers,2014-03-12,article,Brief,,['Mountain Climbing'],"The government is considering contracts with climbing companies that would grant exclusive access to many of its highest mountains, a spokesman for Nepal’s tourism ministry said on Tuesday."," The government is considering contracts with climbing companies that would grant exclusive access to many of its highest mountains, a spokesman for Nepal’s tourism ministry said on Tuesday, as part of an effort to bring more climbers to the Himalayas, the world’s highest mountain range. Nepal has some 3,310 mountains, but only 310 are open to commercial climbing. Since the government determined that it cannot manage all of its peaks, it will soon propose offering 30-year leases on the remaining 3,000 mountains to climbing companies, which would then organize climbs and charge fees. Nepal collects about $2.7 million annually in mountaineering fees, most of which comes from the nearly 35,000 people who visit Mount Everest. Nepal has long been trying to increase and diversify its tourism business, with its extraordinary mountains — 60 peaks higher than 26,000 feet — at the center of those efforts. Nepal is one of the world’s poorest countries, and the country’s youths are increasingly leaving for jobs elsewhere. "

I have not done that kind of work in a long time.” And how does the artist feel about American Apparel now that it’s emblazoned with work from her own hand? “These?” she asks about the simple frocks, jumpsuits and skirts, minimalist shapes that complement her bright, unruly designs. “I will wear them, yes.” There are shirts for men, too, and more cheerful accessories from the capsule will roll out during the summer months to come."

Alberda, who joined the corps de ballet in 2006, has been providing a rare glimpse inside this cloistered world, posting pictures of his fellow dancers to Instagram all winter.

Who Made That Corkscrew?,2014-03-14,article,News,,"['Inventions and Patents', 'Cork', 'Defense and Military Forces', 'Wines']","As bottles sealed with cork became more common, corkscrews did too.","For as long as wine was stored in jugs and stoppered with oil cloth and bits of wood, there was no need for a specialized opener. But in the 17th century, as bottles sealed with cork became more common, corkscrews did too. Collectors say that very early versions of the tool were derived from military kits: Soldiers used screw-shaped “gun worms” to pull misfired musket balls from the barrels of their guns. They would drill into the lead and drag the ammunition up and out. The first corkscrews were small and portable, often nothing more than the worm (the screw itself) and a small ring for pulling with your finger. But in the 18th century, people came to understand the benefits of aging wine, and bottles were standardized in a long-necked cylindrical shape suitable for long-term storage. The new emphasis on shelf life necessitated a better cork — and thus a better corkscrew."

Over time, though, readers do tend to make intuitive decisions. Someone who wants a fast-moving story may seek out what she imagines is a plot-driven novel. Someone who wants to spend time in close quarters, getting to know a person like herself, or perhaps like no one she’s ever met, may choose what appears to be a character-­driven novel. And someone who tends to pepper margins with exclamation points, who calls a friend to shout, “Listen to this line!,” may gravitate toward a book preoccupied with language."

Skyscrapers and everything.” So murmurs a presumably wide-eyed newcomer during a spoken-word break in Stevie Wonder’s “Living for the City,” and who among us outlanders and former rubes did not feel that same sense of mingled recognition and awe when we first set foot here? Thanks to movies and TV, magazines, the news, books — iconography in general — all of us, even natives, carry a mental suitcase stuffed with received images of the Big Apple. That’s true of children, too, for whom the city’s superlatives (biggest, loudest, tallest) hold a special fascination. You might even say that New York is to other American cities what dinosaurs are to other animals — minus, one hopes, the extinction event. And if we are — or were — lucky children, picture books play a huge role in how we picture the city, from “Eloise” and “The Snowy Day” to “Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile,” “In the Night Kitchen,” “You Can’t Take a Balloon Into the Metropolitan Museum” and “The Man Who Walked Between the Towers.”"

(HBO) THE GREAT GATSBY (2013) Leonardo DiCaprio, above, stars as the enigmatic millionaire Jay Gatsby; Carey Mulligan portrays Daisy Buchanan, the object of his obsession; and Tobey Maguire is Nick Carraway, the Midwestern Yale graduate — and, conveniently, Daisy’s cousin — renting the cottage next door to Gatsby’s colossal Long Island mansion in Baz Luhrmann’s stylized musical take on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel. “Despite what you may have heard, it is an eminently enjoyable movie,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this Oscar winner for best costume and production design. Still, he asked, is the tale “a credible love story? Fitzgerald himself was not sure, but Mr. Luhrmann, Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Mulligan make it an effective one. At a crucial, climactic moment — a scene in a suite at the Plaza Hotel — the director mutes his irrepressible circus ringmaster showmanship and plunges into undiluted melodrama. The music stops, and the camera cuts among the assembled faces as the emotional core of the film is laid bare.” That scene, Mr. Scott added, “stands out in a movie that is otherwise gaudily and grossly inauthentic,” like Gatsby himself. “As a character in Nick’s ruminations, in Fitzgerald’s sentences and in our national mythology, he is a complete mess. This movie is worthy of him.” "

What’s on Wednesday,2014-03-19,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"10:30 P.M. (IFC) BOILER ROOM (2000) Before Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio adapted the life of Jordan Belfort for the screen in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Mr. Belfort inspired this fictional tale about a group of young, ruthless stockbrokers who work miles from the trading floor and use nothing but cold calls to relieve unsuspecting clients of their life savings. Giovanni Ribisi (above right, with Ben Affleck) plays Seth, a college dropout who joins the small firm of J. T. Marlin, rising quickly through its ranks, thanks to the no-nonsense tutelage of his possibly corrupt bosses and colleagues (portrayed by Mr. Affleck, Vin Diesel and Nicky Katt, among others). Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that the film, written and directed by Ben Younger, “reflects the sensibility of the generation it holds up to critical scrutiny, and it’s a cunningly ambiguous act of self-portraiture.” He added that Mr. Younger “presents a world ruled by a gang of lawless, soulless children, like the island of lost boys in ‘Peter Pan.’ But his film also shows us a group of actors, and a filmmaker, with soul to spare and talent to burn.”"

Absolute Power,2014-03-21,article,Review,,"['Nuclear Weapons', 'Books and Literature']","The ability of one leader to deploy a nuclear weapon is inherently undemocratic, a social theorist argues.","The problem posed by nuclear weapons — that they work by holding their possessors hostage, with the threat of catastrophic retaliation if used — has confounded thinking about them since the beginning of the nuclear age. One of its earliest analysts, the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the first director of the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos laboratory, which developed the atomic bomb, once compared the two dominant nuclear powers of his day and ours, the United States and Russia, to “scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life.” Oppenheimer chose not to note that scorpions, a species almost as well known for belligerence as Homo sapiens, would sooner or later take that risk.

Evolution of an Activist,2014-03-21,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A biography of the civil rights firebrand Stokely Carmichael.,"In the iconography of black American history, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. have long been understood as dueling poles of identity, one an apostle of contempt, urging a downtrodden race to renounce a nation that had rejected it, the other an exemplar of Christian idealism, committed to the redemptive power of forgiveness and common humanity. The America we inhabit now is both more socially integrated and segregated than it was in the tumultuous days in which the two men lived. A black president coexists with residential and educational patterns that are in some instances more racially separated than they were on the morning of the 1963 March on Washington. This circumstance is not entirely indicative of a failure of will. It’s partly a reflection of the fact that black aspirations for equality were far more complicated than the simple Martin versus Malcolm formulation, just as each man was far more complicated than his public depiction. If those years can be understood as a sort of test, black America looked at the multiple-choice question of identity and answered yes. "

He wrote in German, but was a “German writer” in the same way that Alfred Döblin, Hermann Broch and Stefan Zweig were “Jewish writers”: tragically and by accident. As for what he called himself, he hated the name Winfried Georg, and responded only to “Max.” Shortly after “Austerlitz” was published in English, Sebald died in a car crash.

Jean Zimmerman followed this tradition in her first novel, “The Orphanmaster,” a descent into the hellish criminal haunts of 17th-century New Amsterdam. In SAVAGE GIRL (Viking, $27.95), this canny author puts all that aside and turns to the Gilded Age for a sweeping narrative, set within the cloistered ranks of high society in 19th-century Manhattan, that raises touchy questions about what it means to be civilized."

When she learns that Harry is actually an international spy, Helen gets pulled into a globe-saving mission to stop terrorists with nuclear bombs. “The most engaging part of the film is the long middle section, which toys with marital types,” Caryn James wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Schwarzenegger, she added, is “no Cary Grant, but along with Ms. Curtis, he makes ‘True Lies’ the first successful romantic comedy in which trucks, as well as heartstrings, are blown to bits.” (The movie is repeated at 10 p.m.) On Showtime 2, at 1:35 p.m., Mr. Schwarzenegger stars as John Kimble, an undercover officer in Ivan Reitman’s “Kindergarten Cop” (1990). The search for a drug dealer leads Kimble and his partner (Pamela Reed) to an Oregon school where their suspect’s son is a student. Kimble ends up teaching the class of kindergartners, and though “the film relies on obvious jokes,” Ms. James wrote in The Times, “Mr. Schwarzenegger is so appealing, relaxed and genial in this role that his fans are not likely to ask for more, and even his detractors are likely to be happily surprised.” And there’s one more chance for a dose of Mr. Schwarzenegger before the day ends: On “The Tonight Show,” at 11:34 p.m. on NBC, he will be a guest, along with the television host Carson Daly and the band Vampire Weekend."

She scarcely shared it even with those who knew her. Then again, many of her acquaintances when she was taking some of her remarkable images, particularly in and around Chicago in the 1950s and ’60s, were the children she cared for while working as a nanny. Later in her life, some of those children took care of her in turn, first by moving her into an apartment and then the nursing home where she died in 2009.

A Boyhood Summer of Darkness,2014-03-27,article,Review,,['Movies'],Daniel Patrick Carbone’s haunting debut feature offers a dark vision of boyhood adventure in a great outdoors fraught with peril.,"Daniel Patrick Carbone’s haunting debut feature, “Hide Your Smiling Faces,” evokes a semi-rural 1950s America in which packs of neighborhood boys pass the time riding bikes, exploring the woods and engaging in ritualistic roughhouse games. The mood of the film, shot in areas of Sussex County, N.J., suggests a darker reflection of the same vision of boyhood adventure depicted in Terrence Malick’s “The Tree of Life.” Although the time feels like the 1950s, the appearance of a portable DVD player signals that it is set more or less in the present."

Scholars of Arnold Schwarzenegger, its big-ticket attraction, may also want to check in, just to see what the governator has been up to in his postpolitical golden years.

I hadn’t directed a movie yet, but I had been approved as a journalist by John Ford and endorsed by Hawks — the two most important directors in Wayne’s career — so he quickly became outgoing and pretty candid.

People of the Word,2014-03-28,article,Review,,"['Jews and Judaism', 'Books and Literature']",Simon Schama’s monumental history of the Jews views the Torah as the key to the community’s cohesion.,"From generation to generation — l’dor va dor, as the Good Book says (in Hebrew) — there arises a historian who bequeaths unto the world yet another door-stopping history of the Jews. Forty-one years ago, a young history professor at Cambridge named Simon Schama agreed to complete one such work, left unfinished by the great British Jewish historian Cecil Roth when he died. Schama tried to do the job, he really did, but “for whatever reasons the graft wouldn’t take,” as he writes in the foreword of his own “The Story of the Jews.” Now we know why. Roth was a splendid writer with an encyclopedic knowledge of his field, and Schama is a splendid writer with an encyclopedic acquaintance with a wide range of fields. But Roth wrote history from above, chronicling the doings of great men entangled in great events, whereas Schama writes history from below, and from the middle and from other unexpected angles, resurrecting the unrecorded and long-­forgotten, and analyzing the social and cultural forces that shaped his subjects’ lives. Roth’s and Schama’s approaches to history are at least two generations apart, and Schama’s is the more user-friendly (to this reader, anyway). Although his book, which ends in the 15th century, is destined to become part of a two-volume set big enough to prop anything open, there’s nothing thudding about it. "

His complaints had to do not only with the accelerating gentrification of Brooklyn neighborhoods like Fort Greene and Bedford-Stuyvesant but also with the fact that other historically African-American parts of New York had become whiter and wealthier in recent years.

"To Dance, Perchance to Dream",2014-03-28,article,News,,"['Dancing', 'Theater']","Shakespeare’s plays, which often deal with young love, magic and the elemental, readily lend themselves to dance, as countless adaptations demonstrate.","Romeo and Juliet meet at a dance; Oberon and Titania reconcile with a dance; we’re told how enchantingly Cleopatra once hopped 40 paces down the street; in the final scene of “As You Like It,” Duke Senior addresses the four young couples: “Brides and bridegrooms, dance your happiness away.” In Shakespeare’s plays, dance and movement often recur. (There even are touching moments when characters exclude themselves from dancing. Jaques in “As You Like It” declines to join in: “I am for other than for dancing measures.” In “Romeo and Juliet,” Lord Capulet says to a cousin: “You and I are past our dancing days.”)"

Kagan argues, credibly, that these numbers are actually a judgment on the president’s national security stewardship, and not just an extension of public disillusionment with his domestic policy. Then, somewhat less credibly, he proffers this interpretation of the swoon:"

The book contains a lot of praise for the “immense, surprisingly chatty body of Hebrew literature” — but when the editors of a new anthology, “Poems That Make Grown Men Cry,” asked Schama what brings a tear to his eye, he settled not on any Jewish verse but on “Lullaby,” by the deeply (and deeply conflicted) Anglican W. H. Auden. “The poem suspends time and the brutality of the world,” Schama writes, “at the moment of unanswerably perfect love. . . . It is the honesty embedded amidst sheets and on the pillow that makes the eyes prick and the heart knock.” It’s hard to fault his choice. “Lullaby” was written after the Nazis had come to power — as Auden puts it, “fashionable madmen raise / Their pedantic boring cry” — and it makes a strong case for the triumph of romance, no matter how fleeting. One of the great love poems, it’s so solemn and stately and tender you can almost imagine it set to pipe organ. Here’s how it starts:"

The End of a Long Road,2014-03-28,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],David Brion Davis’s “The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation” completes a trilogy that he began writing in 1959.,"David Brion Davis’s “The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation,” reviewed this week by Brenda Wineapple, concludes a trilogy that Davis began writing in 1959, after he won a Guggenheim fellowship. “I was planning on doing a book on American and British antislavery movements,” he said in an email interview, “but soon found that the first chapter on ‘historical background’ should really constitute a book in itself — ranging from ancient Greece to the late 1700s, with a revolutionary shift in the moral perception of slavery.”"
The Price of Slavery,2014-03-28,article,Review,,"['Slavery', 'Books and Literature']",The final volume of a trilogy centers on 19th-century abolitionism and the origins of the antislavery movement in America.,"In 1862, when Nathaniel Hawthorne headed south from New England to see the Civil War firsthand, he came upon a group of former slaves trudging northward. “They seemed a kind of creature by themselves, not altogether human,” he wrote, “but perhaps quite as good, and akin to the fauns and rustic deities of olden times.” “Whoever may be benefited by the results of this war,” he added, “it will not be the present generation of negroes.”"
More Than a Game,2014-03-28,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Women and Girls']",A study of trends that changed the boundaries for women athletes.,"If you’d rather spend your Sunday getting shocked by electrodes on a Tough Mudder obstacle course than reading 300 pages of academic writing on sports bras and cheerleading — “couched in the hegemony of heteronormative, patriarchal family relations” — you’re not alone. We are, thank God, at a moment in women’s sports history when lady jocks are running marathons and playing pro basketball instead of being told by the former head of the International Ski Federation that ski jumping “seems to not be appropriate for the ladies from a medical point of view.” This is fantastic — and it is also disarmingly recent (2005). So while it’s safe to say that few will be swept away by the prose in “Qualifying Times,” Jaime Schultz, an assistant professor of women’s studies and kinesiology at Penn State University, has done a service by collecting the history of ponytails, tennis whites, tampons and other topics connected to women and sports into one volume."

Home to the Strange Familiar,2014-03-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Teju Cole’s unnamed hero returns to Lagos, hoping to reconnect with the city of his youth.","Teju Cole’s “Open City” was one of the most acclaimed debut novels of recent years. The story of a young African wandering the streets of New York City struck out into new territory for what might be termed immigrant fiction. We have become accustomed to a certain sort of narrative about people who come to the metropolis from the periphery. Whether set in New York, London or elsewhere, such fictions tend to present stories of striving and self-invention. We see the new immigrant struggling to make a life in an unfriendly or even hostile environment, overwhelmed by the novelty of sights and sounds, anxious about holding on to culture and tradition, filled with wonder at first-world wealth and consumption. By contrast, Cole’s narrator in “Open City” is a self-assured young cosmopolitan, an educated professional who does not ask permission to explore, describe and pass judgment. His breadth of cultural reference is not limited to the traditions of West Africa. He is a lover of Mahler and Modernist photography. He reads Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes. "

Deep Water,2014-03-28,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A dam disrupts Appalachian lives in the 1930s.,"The Tennessee Valley Authority brought change to the heart of Appalachia in the 1930s, forcing locals to relocate voluntarily or linger on the land and be removed by their own government. Though the damming of the river would provide electricity and other conveniences across the region, there were many who were not swayed by arguments of the common good and tried to stay, even as the water rose across their fields and toward the houses. Early on in Amy Greene’s aching, passionate and vivid new novel, “Long Man,” a character stands in the night, surveying all that will be lost to progress. “She had heard about a Depression going on but saw no evidence of it herself. She didn’t understand the power company’s reasoning. She didn’t need electric lights when she could see by the sun and moon. She had the spring and the earth to keep her food from spoiling. She had a washboard for scrubbing clean her dresses. If a person didn’t come to depend on material things, it wouldn’t hurt to lose them.”"

A huge waterscape in the desert, this marshland system lies on an ancient alluvial plain Olshan calls “an Eden of reeds and silver waterways, where ruined Bronze Age palaces seemed to doze like exhausted parents, oblivious to the joyful birds that ran riot along their spines.” Its occupants have long been outsiders seeking refuge, often under attack. Over its extensive history a culture and way of life evolved that separated the marshlands from its neighbors and from the world beyond. But no longer. War, occupation and strategic draining have shattered the place, people and environment. "

The project’s sonic environments evoke music most of us don’t think of as music: sound-branding on a corporate website, the soundtrack of an in-flight instructional video, the incidental sounds of a computer. It’s a niche of electronic music with roots in the ambient compositions of the ’70s (Brian Eno famously composed the Microsoft start-up melody) that has evolved over time into a slick marketing sound as risible as advertising jingles.

It was stable and relatively virtuous and soon to be known for having resisted the temptation to make bad subprime loans to Americans or peddle them to ignorant investors. But its management didn’t understand just what an afterthought the bank was — on the rare occasions American financiers thought about it at all.

The sad truth was that hardly anyone noticed it. “The people in Canada are always saying, ‘We’re paying too much for people in the United States,’ ” Katsuyama says. “What they don’t realize is that the reason you have to pay them too much is that no one wants to work for RBC.
