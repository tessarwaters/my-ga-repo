Engineered Performances,2013-11-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Social Media']","A study of Silicon Valley Web enthusiasts concludes that social media produce self-promoting, competitive corporate citizens.","The strange anthropological lesson of social media is that human beings, if given a choice, often prefer to socialize alone. Since the founding of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other mainstays of what technology writers have come to call “the social Web” or “Web 2.0,” a sizable portion of humanity has learned to be together while apart, sacrificing intimacy for control and spontaneity for predictability. On the Web, we can be whoever we wish to be, editing the face we show to others in ways that aren’t possible in physical space. We can also fine-tune the complexity and depth of our interactions and relationships. The result is a sense of freedom whose appeal is evident in the exponential growth of the largest social media services, but it may be a misleading sense of freedom since the tools that make it possible are, for the most part, commercial enterprises, subtly shaping our behavior in ways designed to earn profits for their proprietors.

As complex as chess is, it’s easy to see that its rules can be translated into algorithms so that computers, when they eventually got enough processing power, could crunch through billions of possible moves and past games. Deep Blue’s calculations were a fundamentally different process, most people would say, from the “real” thinking and intuition a human player would use. "
Spyware vs. Spyware,2013-11-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Computers and the Internet']","Hackers and cybercrooks aren’t the only ones lurking on the Internet. The police are there, too.","When we hear about people’s identities being stolen — e-mail appropriated, accounts infiltrated, lives invaded and subverted — a sense of helplessness envelops us. Sure, the victims of such crimes can rebuild their virtual lives, with new account numbers, passwords, Internet providers and computers. But none of this changes the fact that the culprits are unlikely to be caught. We feel something similar when we learn of a new governmental encroachment into our privacy, as we did with the revelations Edward Snowden furnished last spring about the National Security Agency’s ability to monitor our lives online. In both instances, it’s as if everything that was once promised by the computer age — certainty, precision, safety, power — has been little more than a lie. "
Pushing Their Buttons,2013-11-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Computers and the Internet']","A journalist goes behind the bitter rivalry between Apple and Google, and how it’s reshaping the way we think about technology.","Why do many people think that Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple are rivals? They hardly compete directly. Sure, Facebook and Google both sell targeted Web-based advertisements. But they offer such different services that they don’t share a core mission. Apple makes its money selling devices and mobile apps. Microsoft sells computer software and video game consoles. Google makes a free suite of applications that could challenge Microsoft Office. But it has not. Google also runs a social network that no one uses. And it gives away a mobile smartphone operating system. All four seem to be safely in control of distinct missions and markets. They intersect only slightly."

Put That Down!,2013-11-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Computers and the Internet']",Teenage life in a wired age.,"Recently, I found myself on the subway next to a young girl watching cartoons on an iDevice. She stroked its screen softly — lovingly, even — while her face relaxed in happiness. I was charmed. And terrified. We don’t yet know what, if any, the implications will be for a generation coming of age in a digital era, and the question fills even the most tech-savvy among us with a mixture of wonder and trepidation. But that is exactly what two youth-­minded researchers, Howard Gardner and Katie Davis, set out to answer in an ambitious and admirable project. Their efforts, spanning several years, have culminated in the meticulously researched and thoughtful book “The App Generation: How Today’s Youth Navigate Identity, Intimacy and Imagination in a Digital World,” which explores how young people view themselves and their relationships when smart devices are nearly ubiquitous, social rites happen via text message and the currency of popularity is traded in likes and comments on social-sharing apps.

Linked In,2013-11-01,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Psychology and Psychologists']",A psychologist examines our basic need to connect with others.,"Social psychologists love the Prisoner’s Dilemma. They use it to demonstrate the nature of calculated self-interest, with a setup like this: There’s a reward ($10, say) to be split between two players, and what one gets depends on whether the other decides to split things fairly. If both players choose to cooperate, each gets $5. If one cooperates but the other chooses to “defect,” the cooperative player gets nothing and the defector gets all $10. If both defect, they each get a dollar. The challenge is to decide without knowing what your partner has chosen. Defecting is the safer bet: you’ll get at least $1 and possibly $10. If you cooperate, you run the risk that your partner will defect, grabbing the whole pot and leaving you looking like a chump."
Word Travels Fast,2013-11-01,article,Review,,"['Social Media', 'Books and Literature']","Twitter and Facebook are just the latest incarnations of a tradition that dates back 2,000 years, Tom Standage says.","For nearly 20 years, we’ve thought of “new media” as the brash young upstart and “old media” as the stalwart if increasingly embattled establishment. But what if new media aren’t as new as we assume — and old media not really old at all? So argues Tom Standage in “Writing on the Wall,” a provocative book that asks us to look at media less in terms of technology — digital or analog? — than in terms of the role they invite us to play. Are we passive receptors for whatever facts, opinions and ad messages come our way? Or are we participants, sharing what we like with others, amending or commenting in the process? The second is characteristic of the Internet in general and social media in particular. But there’s nothing revolutionary about this, Standage says. Instead, it’s the role of consumer, so typical of 20th-­century mass media, that’s unnatural — and to Standage, a historical blip. "

Yes, it probably has a much lower profile than it should, far lower than bigger cities like Berlin and Munich — even arguably lower than that of its nearby archrival, Cologne. Yes, its soccer team, Fortuna Düsseldorf, was recently relegated from the top division to the second Bundesliga. And no, the capital of the North-Rhine Westphalia state is not regularly considered one of Europe’s top tourist destinations. But let this be your advantage. The artsy, cultivated hometown of both the great Romantic poet Heinrich Heine and the German punk-rock legend Die Toten Hosen, Düsseldorf has more than enough attractions for a rich cultural weekend — or even longer. Although the city is celebrating the 725th anniversary of its founding this year, Düsseldorf’s real draws are to be found in its dozens of new developments: stylish contemporary architecture, impressive modern art, cool new restaurants and even new takes on altbier, the local brew that ranks among Germany’s best beer styles."

On Friday the 13th of September, in an old brick building on 13th Street in Boston’s Charlestown neighborhood, a pair of electrodes was attached to my forehead, one over my brain’s left prefrontal cortex, the other just above my right eye socket. I was about to undergo transcranial direct-current stimulation, or tDCS, an experimental technique for delivering extremely low dose electrical stimulation to the brain. Using less than 1 percent of the electrical energy necessary for electroconvulsive therapy, powered by an ordinary nine-volt battery, tDCS has been shown in hundreds of studies to enhance an astonishing, seemingly implausible variety of intellectual, emotional and movement-related brain functions. And its side effects appear limited to a mild tingling at the site of the electrode, sometimes a slight reddening of the skin, very rarely a headache and certainly no seizures or memory loss. Still, I felt more than a bit apprehensive as I prepared to find out if a little bit of juice could amp up my cognitive reserves and make me, in a word, smarter."

What’s on Saturday,2013-11-02,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) PROMISED LAND (2012) Matt Damon, above, plays a corporate predator and staunch defender of his company’s cause — fracking, the contentious drilling technique for natural gas — who arrives in a small farming town with the belief that he is offering local landowners a lifeline. Some, hearing the amounts being offered for drilling rights, are eager to sign up. But troubles arise when an old-timer (Hal Holbrook) starts asking questions about what fracking will do to the water supply, the livestock and the land itself. Then an environmental activist (John Krasinski) appears on the scene. The movie “has a point to make, and it does so in a way that is both honorable and disappointing,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film, directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Mr. Damon and Mr. Krasinski. “It admirably tries to represent both sides of the fracking debate, even though its allegiance is clearly to the antifracking position. There is nothing wrong with such advocacy, except that in this case it means that the movie veers away from its strengths, ending in a welter of convenient (and dubious) plot twists and puffed-up speeches.” "

All Aboard!,2013-11-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"From steam locomotives to high-speed rail, three picture books celebrate America’s love of trains.","Trains are big, strong, fast, loud. Just like America. Trains typically get in trouble when they’re not moving forward. Just like America. They’re romantic, too — again, just like America, or at least the idea of America. So it’s no wonder that trains, whether as symbols of might or restlessness, have played such an iconic role in our popular culture, from the folk tale “John Henry” to such songs as “Mystery Train” and “500 Miles,” to films as varied as “The General,” “North by Northwest” and “Before Sunrise.” But who loves trains more than kids? You’d think there would be a surfeit of whistle-blowing, wheels-aturning classics in the picture-book section, shelves and shelves of them, right up there with bunny books and princesses. Trains are so wonderfully graphic, too, slashing across landscapes and barreling full speed ahead to force dramatic perspectives — after all, what is a train but a line on steroids? Funny, though, I can think of only a couple of genuine picture-book classics starring locomotives: “The Little Engine That Could” and “The Polar Express” — and maybe I should also include “Green Eggs and Ham,” because as a rule, one should always include “Green Eggs and Ham.” (“I will not eat them in the rain.

But in Alissa Quart’s new book, “Republic of Outsiders,” we meet the often unlikely agitators who are participating in new social and cultural revolutions using the tools of what we would once have called the Man — technology, entrepreneurialism and even finance.

But Marie Colvin, one of the bravest and certainly best-dressed foreign correspondents of our time, simply turned that injury, which she sustained while reporting in Sri Lanka for The Sunday Times of London, into a style statement. After an excruciating recovery involving flashbacks of the attack, this extraordinary American reporter donned a black eye patch and returned to the field to risk her life over and over again. When she was killed by a rocket attack in Syria in February 2012 on yet another assignment, colleagues were stunned, although not exactly surprised. Colvin, after all, often arrived at the front lines first and stayed longer than others. She had been stranded on a 12,000-foot mountain in Chechnya. She was nearly lynched in Egypt. She spent half her 56 years in the world’s most brutal conflict zones. Her luck couldn’t last forever."

Holding Court,2013-11-08,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Courts and the Judiciary']",Richard A. Posner distills his 31 years of experience as a federal judge.,"In a famous passage in Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 case establishing the power of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall observed that the question of whether an act inconsistent with the Constitution could stand “is a question deeply interesting to the United States, but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest.” Two hundred and ten years later, another eminent jurist has turned to questions whose intricacy matches — or exceeds — their interest. “Reflections on Judging” by Richard A. Posner, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, is about what judges should do when confronted with complexity. Like the rest of us, judges face an increasingly bewildering world, marked by daily advances in such areas as social media, the sciences and globalization. Unlike the rest of us, judges must make decisions that enforce their understanding — or misunderstanding — of that complexity onto millions. In its organization, this is a simple book. Posner recognizes that awesome charge: he decries one common response to complexity, and endorses another."

Watch Your Back,2013-11-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"“Police,” Jo Nesbo’s densely plotted and disturbing new tale about a serial killer, features key narrative elements and several characters from his previous novel, “Phantom.”","Stop! Put that book down! You may think it’s time to catch up with Jo Nesbo, the Norwegian crime novelist everyone’s talking about, and you’re right. But POLICE (Knopf, $25.95) is no place to start. This densely plotted story, translated by Don Bartlett, is one of Nesbo’s darkest and most disturbing, the tale of a serial killer with a taste for the macabre who observes the anniversary of each of his murders by luring a police detective to a gruesome death at the scene of the very crime the officer failed to solve. The chills are palpable in this nerve-­racking thriller, but key narrative elements and several characters are straight out of Nesbo’s previous novel, “Phantom,” which begs to be read first."

Beauties and Beasts,2013-11-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"From “Once upon a time” to “Happily ever after,” these adaptations breathe new life into classic fairy tales.","With their violent excesses and winning magic, fairy tales once entertained adults and children together. As John Updike said, they were the television and pornography of an earlier age, and they rarely pulled punches, even when the young were listening in. Today, fairy tales move on two different tracks: films like “Snow White and the Huntsman” and television series like “Once Upon a Time” add existential torment, surreal plot twists and macabre special effects for their adolescent and adult audience, while adaptations for children tame the tales’ original melodrama and impose moral lessons on their plotlines."
Vanishing Acts,2013-11-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Meg Rosoff’s young adult novel, a family friend disappears, and a girl feels misled by those she trusts the most.","Mila and her father, Gil, are about to embark on a trip from London, where they live, to the United States, where Mila’s father’s best friend, Matthew, lives. The trip has been planned for months, but just as they’re ready to leave, Matthew’s wife phones to tell them Matthew has vanished. Should they go on the trip anyway? They decide they will, but now the trip is no longer a vacation, but a missing-person investigation. So begins Meg Rosoff’s “Picture Me Gone,” a melancholy and ruminative book that is part travelogue, part mystery and part coming-of-age for Mila. Mila is a rarefied sort of narrator, familiar to certain parts of Rosoff’s adopted London and to places like New York City, if not many other locations. Mila is the only child of a ­Swedish-Sudanese orchestra-musician mother and a father who translates Portuguese into English; they came to parenthood late, never marrying."

The others are set around Sylveros, an enchanted town nestled within the Palisade of Thorns. Outside the palisade, Nightmares roam. Inside, Petlings predominate. These are human-size, upright-walking, talking animals that were “once the favorite pet of a human child.” “The Twistrose Key” is a fantasy of the alternative-and-contiguous world sort, in which events in our world may influence theirs, and vice versa."

This bit of information, along with most everything she has to say about her father, is delivered with the simpering brand of scorn reserved for teenagers discussing their parents. Amy, an only child and in her final weeks at a girls’ school in London, is a prickly misfit of the highest order — one part Holden Caulfield, one part Lisbeth Salander. And she’s got plenty to be mad about: Her mother, who suffered from depression, committed suicide two years earlier.

When their “Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes” finally appeared in 1951, it caused a stir, not only by validating childhood lore as a serious field of study but also by making the case for the rhymes as literature that generations had remembered less for their nonsense than for their nutshell artistry and usefulness in everyday life."

And it’s not the most accessible, either. It’s crowded with genealogy and tangents, and written in a style that’s hard to understand. Yet what can we do? We Jews have only this one set of Scriptures to go on.

And while children learn early on that a leopard can’t change his spots, it’s equally important to remember that each pattern is unique. Three new picture books explore the nuances of individuality through the exploits of feral creatures who aren’t always what they appear to be — except, of course, when they are."

But it can’t be as exhausting as being James Patterson, who has multiple adult, young adult and middle-grade series coming out simultaneously. He does have help. “Treasure Hunters,” Patterson’s latest middle-grade novel, was written with his frequent collaborator Chris Grabenstein; another writer, Mark Shulman, and an illustrator, Juliana Neufeld, are also credited inside. As befits the number of human beings involved, the book is pretty jam-packed. The siblings Bick, Beck, Tommy and Storm have grown up on a 63-foot sailboat, helping their father, a famous oceanographer, dredge up Spanish galleons, sunken Ming dynasty pottery and diamond-encrusted Cypriot artifacts. But when their mother disappears in Cyprus and their father is washed overboard, the kids have to keep the vessel and the family treasure-­hunting business afloat while escaping from all sorts of villains including, but not limited to, an arms dealer who collects Grecian urns; “Ukranian knuckle-draggers”; and a vicious coed."

This is not a state that believes in lavish spending on schooling. Yet, quite remarkably, it provides universal high-quality pre-K, with a ratio of no more than 10 students per staff member, and all teachers have a college degree."

For the last several months, the museum’s president, Don Bacigalupi, and an assistant curator for special projects, Chad Alligood, have been traveling by plane and car to almost every part of the country, relying on an initial list of 10,000 artists, to find works they will include in the show. They have visited more than 400 studios and artists so far, in dozens of cities, but also in rural places so small that the roads to them have not shown up on the curators’ GPS devices. “We’ve come to recognize that many extraordinary artists may be known in their own locales, but have yet to emerge on the national stage,” Mr. Alligood said. “Their work, however, deserves consideration from a national audience.” “State of the Art” could be seen as a traditionalist alternative to a show like the Whitney Biennial, but there are currently no plans to make it a recurring event."

The discovery adds credence to the prevailing theory that the virus originates in bats but usually reaches humans through camels. In three earlier clusters of MERS cases, the first patient to fall ill in each was reported to have had contact with a sick camel. Although antibodies to the disease had been found in camels before, the virus itself had not. Genetic tests will be done, the ministry said, to see if the camel’s strain is identical to that found in the patient, a 43-year-old man in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, who is still hospitalized. MERS has killed 64 people since it was first isolated a year ago, 53 of them in Saudi Arabia. It can also spread from human to human, but seems to do so less readily than SARS — severe acute respiratory syndrome — did. "

Heroes and Crusaders,2013-11-14,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Doris Kearns Goodwin’s “Bully Pulpit” is built around two relationships: one between the reformist politicians Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, and the other between power and the press.","If you find the grubby spectacle of today’s Washington cause for shame and despair — and, really, how could you not? — then I suggest you turn off the TV and board Doris Kearns Goodwin’s latest time machine. Let her transport you back to the turn of the 20th century, to a time when this country had politicians of stature and conscience, when the public believed that government could right great wrongs, when, before truncated attention spans, a 50,000-word exposé of corruption could sell out magazines and galvanize a reluctant Congress. The villains seemed bigger, too, or at least more brazen — industrial barons and political bosses who monopolized entire industries, strangled entire cities. And “change” was not just a slogan. “There are but a handful of times in the history of our country,” Goodwin writes in her introduction, “when there occurs a transformation so remarkable that a molt seems to take place, and an altered country begins to emerge.” The years covered in this book are such a time. It makes a pretty grand story."

You May Already Be a Winner. Or Not.,2013-11-14,article,Review,,['Movies'],"“Nebraska,” Alexander Payne’s fourth film set at least partly in his home state, stars Bruce Dern, Will Forte and June Squibb in a comedy that gets under a cantankerous older man’s skin.","It may or may not be a coincidence that Alexander Payne’s new film, “Nebraska,” shares its name with Bruce Springsteen’s austere album from 1982. Nebraska is a roomy state, and Mr. Payne, born and raised in Omaha, has set three of his previous features at least partly in it (“Citizen Ruth,” “Election” and “About Schmidt”). But to my ear, at least, a specific Springsteenian echo announces itself early and deepens as this movie winds from Billings, Mont., across the Badlands and toward Lincoln, stopping for a while in the tiny and fictitious hamlet of Hawthorne. Beyond the folky intonations of the fiddle-and-guitar waltz (by Mark Orton) that accompanies the opening images (shot by Phedon Papamichael) and beyond the bleak beauty of the images themselves, there is something in the movie that brings to mind the haunting last line of the album’s title track: “Sir I guess there’s just a meanness in this world.”"

Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery,2013-11-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Arkady Renko turns to a translator’s cryptic notebook while investigating two deaths in Moscow.,"It’s a spooky feeling, if you’re a translator who loves bicycling and word games and likes traveling to Russia, to open a book and encounter, in the very first chapter, a translating, cycling crossword fanatic who is plucked from a Kaliningrad beach by a homburg-hatted butcher, hurled into a carcass-strewn meat van and never heard from again. (Note to self: Avoid Kaliningrad.) At the time he was nabbed, the translator was carrying a notebook he’d used at a session of multilingual, high-stakes business negotiations. His abductor, flipping through the pages, was infuriated to find them filled with illegible doodles — stars, bugs, cats and spirals — the translator’s own private code. “Let the birds read it,” the butcher declared, flinging the notebook into the wind. Local children later found it in the sea grass. "
Compulsive Behavior,2013-11-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Four linked stories explore characters’ bottomless needs and stubborn weaknesses.,"If folklorists are to be believed, the postnuptial tradition obliging the bridegroom to carry his bride over the threshold of their first home has less to do with ensuring the couple’s good luck and more to do with maintaining the bride’s good name. Apparently the custom spread from ancient Rome throughout medieval Europe as a politically fraught pantomime of chastity’s death at the marriage altar: The new wife, presumably reluctant to relinquish her virginity, had to be physically transported into her new matrimonial setting by her impatient husband."
Running Battles,2013-11-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Pat Conroy’s family memoir centers on his father, the inspiration for “The Great Santini.”","It’s a rare memoir that begins by telling you it’s been told several times before, but that’s the case with “The Death of Santini.” The very title of Pat Conroy’s latest book, alluding to his novel “The Great Santini,” affirms that the abusive fighter pilot at the center of that story and the father mourned here are essentially one and the same. To dispel any lingering doubt, Conroy announces at the outset that the fictions he has spun over his long, celebrated literary career aren’t really fictions. They’re diamonds hauled up to earth and into the light of day from the dark and bottomless mine of his Southern clan: the tyrannical patriarch, the wounded matriarch, their seven self-destructive sons and daughters. We’ve met their alter egos and avatars, those of us who’ve supped contentedly on Conroy’s big-flavored prose through the years. In “The Death of Santini,” he more or less acknowledges that we’ll simply be reintroduced to them by their real names."

Battle-Shocked,2013-11-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Wounded at the start of Grant’s Overland Campaign, a soldier faces recovery in a military hospital.","It’s no surprise Dennis McFarland chose the Battle of the Wilderness as the contextual scaffolding for his searing, poetic and often masterly new Civil War novel, “Nostalgia.” The intense three-day campaign, fought in Northern Virginia in May 1864, was the first showdown between the armies of Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, and the casualties on both sides were staggering. It marked the beginning of Grant’s Overland Campaign, a strategy that eventually led to the sieges of Petersburg and Richmond and the defeat of the Confederacy. Yet details of the battle remain as shrouded as the thick forests in which it occurred. There were few brilliant maneuvers, few heroes remembered by history, and no clear winner. What a perfect setting, then, for a novel exploring the chaos of war and the confounding disorientation of its aftermath. "

One key to Goodwin’s popularity as a historian has been her ability to spot overlaps between contemporary politics and the distant past — or even to create those overlaps herself, through the strength of her storytelling; when Barack Obama tapped his primary opponents Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton for important posts in his administration, he cited Goodwin’s account of Lincoln’s cabinet, “Team of Rivals,” as one influence."

Almost all are memorable: “Dog Soldiers,” “A Flag for Sunrise,” “Outerbridge Reach,” “Damascus Gate.” He tackles a genre — frequently the thriller but, in the case of his latest book, the campus novel — and twists it to his purposes in ways that surprise and provoke. A subtle writer, he demands an attentive reader as he explores, through superficially familiar narratives, substantial themes."

(“One Does Not Joke About Finnick’s Casting” was the title of one of many obsessed Tumblr pages.) Sam Claflin, 27, won the part, which still seems to be sinking in for this classically trained British actor.

Why Food Stamps Are a Great Investment,2013-11-16,article,News,,[],Readers comment on my column about the importance of food stamps to fight malnutrition and hunger right here in America.,"My Sunday column looks at the issue of food stamps, subject of a forthcoming battle on Capitol Hill. The program will be cut, but it’s unclear by how much. My column argues that it would be short-sighted, as well as cruel, to slash the program, for a couple of reasons. First, almost two-thirds of recipients are children, elderly or disabled. Second, particularly with the children who are recipients, the malnutrition is real and there is mounting evidence that it has long-term effects that leave those children less equipped to succeed at school and live productive lives. I’m particularly swayed by the NBER study that my column cites and links to, indicating that when children under five get food stamps, their long-term health outcomes are better, and they are less likely to end up on welfare. Read the column, but I’d also encourage you to read the study."

After Hours | An Irishman’s Inner Marcel Proust,2013-11-18,article,News,,[],"“Souvenir,” an hourlong one-man show, pays homage to “Remembrance of Things Past,” 100 years later.","Bush Moukarzel’s first line in the one-man play “Souvenir,” now playing at the Abrons Arts Center in New York, is, “For a long time, I went to bed early.” It’s also the very famous first line of Marcel Proust’s “Remembrance of Things Past,” published a century ago this year.

A giant diptych of Proust hangs overhead. Everywhere, there’s a clutter of half-opened packing boxes, marked cheekily with labels like “Mum,” “Apologies, “Bacon,” “Broken Glass” and (inevitably) “Madeleines.”"

What’s On Thursday,2013-11-21,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (IFC) EYES WIDE SHUT (1999) A doctor (Tom Cruise), enraged by the desire of his wife (Nicole Kidman, above, with Mr. Cruise) for another man, embarks on an odyssey of sexual temptation in this final film by Stanley Kubrick, inspired by Arthur Schnitzler’s “Traumnovelle” (“Dream Story”). Open-ended vignettes star Sydney Pollack as the unsavory host of a lavish Christmas party, Alan Cumming as a conspiratorial hotel concierge, Rade Sherbedgia as the proprietor of a costume rental shop, and Leelee Sobieski as his naughty daughter. “There is consolation for having to read the words ‘The End’ on the posthumous work of Mr. Kubrick: this astonishing last film is a spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “Despite some abrupt editing in a work that the director never lived to fine-tune, the film moves effortlessly, and it goes straight under the skin. Its powerful and lingering resonance attests to a final compassion and profundity in Mr. Kubrick, the body-and-soul commitment of Mr. Cruise and Ms. Kidman, and the Rorschach-like ability of this material to envelop audiences in ways unexplained and unexpected.” She added: “ ‘Life goes on,’ Mr. Pollack’s character says cynically late in the film. ‘It always does, until it doesn’t.’ Along with that sentiment, Mr. Kubrick left one more brilliantly provocative tour de force as his epitaph.”"

In the years following, though, he had starred in only two live-action films (and provided a voice for the cartoon “ParaNorman”). His most recent and notorious creative project was in 2010, when he poured his heart, brain and wallet into “I’m Still Here,” a passion project he made with his brother-in-law and close friend, Joaquin Phoenix. The hoax-documentary purported to chronicle Phoenix’s real-life personal implosion, as he supposedly made the switch from acting to a rap career. The film not only met with many terrible reviews but actually seemed to enrage the media. Dana Stevens of Slate had a not untypical critical reaction: “The worst thing about ‘I’m Still Here’ is the fact that it exists.”"

She has the pedigree, as the daughter of the bluesman Chris Whitley, and she has the voice, which holds smoke and sorrow, exhortation and ache. But she’s not one for established formats. Her mother is Belgian, and Ms. Whitley spent years in Europe, in theater and dance troupes, before settling in New York in her teens. She was a member of Black Dub, led by the producer Daniel Lanois, and her own songs move between confession and conundrum, with shades of Fiona Apple and Alicia Keys. For “Fourth Corner,” she collaborated with the keyboardist-composer Thomas Bartlett on songs that were orchestrated with string sections and gusts of guitar reverb and distortion. Onstage, with her electric guitar, her music can be cathartic. (7:30 p.m. Saturday, Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com.)"

Points of Entry,2013-11-22,article,Review,,"['Poetry and Poets', 'Books and Literature']",The wrangling over poetry’s accessibility is often a proxy for a centuries-old squabble between people who like their poems plain-looking and people who like them a little more rococo.,"At any given moment, millions of people in this country are happily not reading poems, and dozens of poets are happy to say they don’t care. “I have never been one of the people who feel it essential to increase the audience for poetry,” the former poet laureate Louise Glück remarked several years ago. “The people who need it find it.” Variations on this sentiment are fairly common among poets and critics across the aesthetic spectrum, and for the most part that’s to be expected. Every activity generates experts, and experts typically have little time for novices. This is no less true of poetry folk than of photographers or pastry chefs."

Even Madder Men,2013-11-22,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Men and Boys']","Michael Kimmel reports on men who, after a series of economic and political shifts, feel emasculated and humiliated.","The characters populating Michael Kimmel’s new book, “Angry White Men,” are familiar types: Rush Limbaugh’s ditto­heads, neo-Nazis, wife beaters, rampaging shooters and the divorced rageaholics of the men’s rights movement. Crowded together under one banner, they make for a scary and unpleasant lot: full of fury and blaming everyone but themselves for their problems. Mostly, they blame women: ex-wives, would-be girlfriends, the phantom black women who stole their jobs. The editor of a men’s rights website proclaims, “The real question here is not whether these women deserve the business end of a right hook, they obviously do, and some of them deserve one hard enough to leave them in an unconscious, innocuous pile on the ground.”"

A signal lever is within your reach; if you pull it, you can divert the runaway trolley down a side track, saving the five — but killing another person, who is tied to that spur. What do you do? Most people say they would pull the lever: Better that one person should die instead of five. "
O Radiant Future!,2013-11-22,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Eleven dystopic fables by the early Soviet writer Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky.,"The stories in this collection by the early Soviet writer Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky are nearly as fantastic as the crashing combination of consonants at the beginning of his surname. In one, the reflection of a man in his girlfriend’s eye vanishes down the dark corridors of her pupil and falls into a deep well, where it joins the lonely, miserable reflections of her previous lovers. There the reflections debate their mistress’s charms and caprices, as well as their own deficiencies of character. And they plot their escape. The hero of another story, a writer, composes a tale about a hermit whose prayers temporarily close all the cracks in the world — potholes, mountain gorges, facial wrinkles, even “the cranial seams hidden under the skin on people’s heads.” After reading the yarn to some indifferent friends, the writer is visited by an enthusiastic scientist, a reincarnation of the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who claims that reality itself, the entire space-time continuum, is no less cracked than our everyday world, riddled with gaps and intermittencies."

Born and raised in New Zealand (her mother worked as a maid for Katherine Mansfield’s family, her father for the railroad), Frame developed a youthful love of poetry that sustained her through several years spent in and out of psychiatric hospitals — until the publication of her first book, a collection of stories called “The Lagoon,” in 1951. ­(After her receipt of a major literary award, her doctor sensibly decided against giving her a lobotomy.)"

Before the Sun Rose,2013-11-22,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Letters']",The second volume of Ernest Hemingway’s letters shows him beginning to make his way in Paris.,"In the Paris spring of 1925, a young American writer sent a letter to his new publisher in which he assessed his ­chances in the literary marketplace. The only commercial magazine to which he had as yet sold a story was a German number that wanted to translate a piece about a matador, but he nevertheless told Horace Liveright he hoped to become a valuable “property.” Most readers found modern literature too difficult, and he knew that some wonderful books had been commercial failures; Liveright himself had published more than a few of them. Still, his own collection of stories was different, and he felt he had a “good gambling chance to sell.” For his work, he thought, would “be praised by highbrows and can be read by lowbrows. There is no writing in it that anybody with a high school education cannot read.”"

For nearly a thousand years, worshipers at this spot had built walls, knocked them down, dug holes and burned offerings to their gods, leaving behind baffling, ambiguous remains. One day, as I was staring at the dirt in a heat-induced daze, a younger student commented how hard it was to make sense of it all. I could only agree, but as we chatted, I realized — to my deep embarrassment — that we were talking about entirely different things. I was obsessing over the technicalities of decoding this complex deposit, while he wanted to know what it had felt like to stand there 2,500 years earlier, sacrificing to alien gods.

What’s On Friday,2013-11-22,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"2 P.M. (Showtime) STAGE BEAUTY (2004) In this high-end costume drama about theater in 17th-century England, directed by Richard Eyre and based on a play by Jeffrey Hatcher, Billy Crudup, above, portrays Ned Kynaston, among the last of the old-school female impersonators and a specialist in doomed Shakespearean heroines. Claire Danes is Maria Hughes, who starts out as his stage-struck dresser and later becomes his rival as women are allowed to appear onstage. Rupert Everett hams it up as King Charles II; and Tom Wilkinson is Othello to Ned’s Desdemona. “For about two-thirds of its length ‘Stage Beauty’ is propelled by a complex and fascinating set of ideas about sexual identity and theatrical performance,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But as it rushes toward an upbeat ending, the movie at once recoils from this notion and bizarrely succumbs to its logic. In disowning drag and in straightening out Ned Kynaston, ‘Stage Beauty’ — absurdly for a work that professes to revel in the love of theater — takes a literal-minded stand for the straight and narrow in both sex and art.”"

Feeling For | A Parisian-Style Retreat in the Heart of Greenwich Village,2013-11-26,article,News,,['Hotels and Travel Lodgings'],"Once a favorite of Jack Kerouac, the recently reopened Marlton Hotel in Greenwich Village is a must-visit for both its lodgings and its libations.","The Marlton House, built in 1900 and later a haven for Jack Kerouac and his crew, reopened this fall as the Marlton, a Parisian-inspired 107-room boutique hotel in the heart of Greenwich Village, just off Washington Square Park. It offers the same cool, casual elegance as the Bowery Hotel, a few blocks across town, but at a fraction of the price. The similarities to the Bowery are no surprise, as the Marlton is the work of the hotelier Sean MacPherson (also a developer of the Maritime and the Jane), who has once again created a hotel that feels as if it wasn’t designed just to sleep but also to sidle up to the bar in a dignified way and watch the P.Y.T.’s come and go. It’s the kind of place you could easily visit for afternoon tea with a parent on one of the plush sofas, or rendezvous with your lover for a martini followed by a trip to one of the small yet charming rooms, where the bed is the main attraction and finishing details are not overlooked. If you’re not in the mood for libations — and with creations like the Marvelous Sour (recipe below), the Marlton has taken steps to make sure that never happens — there is an espresso bar in the lobby that makes raw almond cappuccinos and gluten-free, vegan breakfast cookies. Coming soon will be a 98-seat restaurant in the rear of the lobby, Café Marlton, which will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. As a longtime neighbor of the building the Marlton now occupies, I can safely say it’s the best recent addition to the neighborhood where charm reigns supreme. "

The Perils of Anti-Decadence,2013-11-27,article,News,,[],"On J.F.K., “Brave New World,” and the perils of seeking political solutions to cultural and moral stagnation.","My Sunday column tried to draw a serious point out of the coincidence of Aldous Huxley, C.S. Lewis and John F. Kennedy all entering the hereafter within a few hours of each other, portraying the resilience of the Kennedy mythos as, in part, a kind of secular/liberal rebellion against the same disenchanted utilitarian materialism that both Huxley and Lewis famously critiqued. This is a reason, I wrote, for even J.F.K. skeptics like myself to feel a little sympathy for the cult of Camelot — because it speaks to a deep and admirable human desire “for grace and beauty, for icons and heroes, for a high-stakes dimension to human affairs that a consumerist, materialist civilization can flatten and exclude.” The various things that J.F.K.’s admirers cite when they praise the man and his administration — the physical vigor and the soaring rhetoric, the patronage of high culture and the man-on-the-moon technological ambition, the Cuban Missile Crisis drama and the founding of the Peace Corps  — might not match up to a reality that was much more personally sleazy, culturally incurious and geopolitically reckless. But better a slightly bogus “vigah” than a society that deliberately cultivates what Lewis termed “men without chests.” Better a gap between self-sacrificial aspirations and grubbier realities than a society like Huxley’s “Brave New World” that excludes any dreams higher than comfort and consumption."

The arrival of Starbucks hasn’t completely sidelined the local preference for Turkish coffee and the city’s old market — where kerchiefed farm wives sell their pickles in recycled jars and there is an abundant supply of the delicious cheese-filled phyllo pastries known as banitsa — is still busy, despite the big supermarkets opening on the outskirts of town."

The whitish-gray, mostly environmentally green building is the latest museum from Herzog & de Meuron, which designed the expansion of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the De Young Museum in San Francisco. The three-story 120,000 square-foot building consists of a group of geometric volumes that seem almost to levitate between a base of several platforms and an immense perforated canopy overhead. In addition to reducing energy consumption, the canopy will support one of the museum’s most distinctive features: a hanging garden of native plants irrigated by collected rainwater. The effect is of an expanded Corbusier villa that has absorbed its greensward. The opening exhibitions seem bent on making the most of the museum’s small collection and nearly 31,000 square feet of gallery space, but with a probable destination building like this, it may not matter."

"West Coast Style, by the Numbers",2013-11-27,article,News,,[],"The rapper who calls himself 100s has a genuinely beautiful mane of hair not seen since the days of Suga Free, and that’s not an accident.","The rapper who calls himself 100s has a genuinely beautiful mane of hair not seen since the days of Suga Free, and that’s not an accident: 100s is part of the proud California pimp-rap legacy, and aesthetics matter. On his self-released debut album from last year, “Ice Cold Perm,” he raps with a smooth sneer over gooey tracks that recall the West Coast of the early-mid 1990s, a sound that’s been undervalued historically. And his new singles “Life of a Mack” (also heard in the video game “Grand Theft Auto V”) and “Keep a Bitch Broke” — in advance of a new EP, “IVRY” (Fool’s Gold) — show an admirable commitment to keeping that style alive. 100s is the most exciting artist on the “Turnt & Burnt” tour — along with the headliner, ASAP Ferg — which comes to Irving Plaza this week, and also features various other members of the ASAP Mob, as well as Joey Fatts, Aston Matthews and OverDoz.

(It is suggested from the surviving correspondence that Anne might have had lesbian leanings, though whether these were ever acted upon is unknown.)

Freud was so well known that he was allowed into Clarke’s — a “small upmarket restaurant” frequented by Bryan Ferry, Salman Rushdie, Dame Maggie Smith, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge — before it opened in the morning, and invited to enjoy a leisurely meal in what functioned as his private salon. Over dinner at London’s more glittering establishments, he could pelt strangers with breadsticks, spew obscenities, pummel a waiter, grope the waitresses, amuse his companions by imitating a masturbating whale — and be welcomed back the next evening. At Clarke’s, “Lucian’s conversation ranged from dating Greta Garbo to the best way to land a punch without breaking your thumb, to how he had popped in to 10 Downing Street to see Gordon Brown, or had been to a nightclub with Kate Moss.” Oh, the life of an artist!"

At 5, he was banished from this paradise and sent back to the mother country to be raised by a placid English couple.

She came of age during the Wars of the Roses, the dynastic rivalry between the Houses of York and Lancaster. As the daughter of a Yorkist king, Edward IV, and the wife of the first Tudor (Lancastrian) king, Henry VII, she united these warring houses. For this alone, she deserves a prominent place in English history. "
Murder at the Vicarage,2013-11-29,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In “No Man’s Nightingale,” by Ruth Rendell, Inspector Wexford investigates a murder case bungled by his old deputy.","NO MAN’S NIGHTINGALE (Scribner, $26) is Ruth Rendell’s 24th Inspector Wexford procedural mystery in almost 50 years, so we’re naturally curious about how that venerable detective may have mellowed in retirement. Well, his mind is still sharp enough to solve a murder case bungled by Mike Burden, his old deputy and now detective superintendent of the Kingsmarkham constabulary. Always a tolerant man, Wexford is ever more alarmed by the racism and bigotry that have taken root in his little patch of England and were a factor in the murder of the Rev. Sarah Hussain, a biracial single mother raising an out-of-wedlock child. And, if anything, he’s grown more caustic about barbaric insults to the mother tongue, like the Alternative Service Book that replaced the Book of Common Prayer in Anglican churches."

Ethan comes with a nanny, Amma (Viola Davis, above left, with Ms. Englert and Mr. Ehrenreich). “ ‘Beautiful Creatures,’ its sweet young things and supernatural shenanigans have been marshaled to help fill the box office void left by the end of the ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Twilight’ franchises,” Ms. Dargis said of this adaptation of Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl’s book. “It’s a void that ‘The Hunger Games’ has already started to fill, partly by tapping into deeply American themes and giving them thrilling female form. ‘Beautiful Creatures’ has been spun from thinner material, despite its strong female characters, nods at the Civil War and a story that turns on good versus evil, a fight that — as in many young adult stories — is somewhat mirrored in the struggle between the high school herd and the individual.
