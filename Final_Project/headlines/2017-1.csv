The small devices, typically mounted on officers’ shirts, provide a lens into law enforcement that is meant to build transparency and trust.

Already, at least 19 states have enacted laws restricting public access to  footage, and a dozen more are proposing legislation. This four-chapter video series examines the challenges and incentives — social, political and economic — surrounding the rapid rise of police body cameras. Our story begins in Cincinnati, with a pitch for their use to officers in training."

How to Be Civil in an Uncivil World,2017-01-11,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Customs, Etiquette and Manners']",Should civility be based on mutual contempt rather than mutual respect?

Worrisome stuff, of course — but a little vague. If, as any historian will tell you, people in all times and places have been alarmed by this development (the ancient Romans called it pugna verborum, or “the battle of words”), you might wonder how urgent, or even actual, the trouble really is. Then there’s the problem of definition. One man’s civility is another man’s repression.

Or were they the ones demanding civility, in the form of simple recognition of the lives of people with AIDS? Is Donald Trump dangerously boorish?

The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,2017-01-13,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"The scientist Elizabeth Blackburn won a Nobel Prize for some of the discoveries she and Elissa Epel write about in “The Telomere Effect,” an anti-aging book new at No. 15 in hardcover nonfiction.","Resolved: January is self-help season — all those resolute readers, still nursing champagne hangovers and chocolate tummy aches, snatch up titles like “Food, Health and Happiness” (No. 1 on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list) and “The Lose Your Belly Diet” (No. 2 on the same list), which will linger for a month or so before giving way to funny cat books, only to resurface like freckles at the first sign of beach weather. It’s not all questionable science and impossible aspirations, though. “The Telomere Effect,” an anti-aging book new at No. 15 on the hardcover nonfiction list, was written by a couple of honest-to-God scientists: Elizabeth Blackburn, president of the Salk Institute and a 2009 Nobel laureate in medicine, and Elissa Epel, a health psychologist who directs the Aging, Metabolism and Emotion Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The quick version of their book, and their research, is that our chromosomes rely on protective caps (called telomeres) akin to the tips that keep shoelaces from fraying; healthy living, they claim, can preserve or even restore those caps to slow the effects of aging. “Move your body,” Blackburn advised listeners of WNYC radio this month, in an interview with the journalist Jonathan Capehart in which she also casually deployed the correct term for those shoelace tips. (They’re aglets.) “Everyone thinks, ‘Oh, I have to run marathons and join expensive gyms and things like that.’ It turns out really brisk walking, even for short periods of time every day, buffers or alleviates some of the stress-related telomere shortening that happens in chronically stressed people. This is very encouraging, because even if you have a short lunchtime, you can get out and really briskly walk 10 minutes every day. . . . It’s totally doable, and it’s free.”"

As played by Michael Keaton, an actor who generates terrific centrifugal force, Ray seems more like a guy who fuels up on 10 cups of coffee before calling it a night with a bottle of Scotch. “The Founder” never figures out what makes him spin and run and keep on running, but it does give you Mr. Keaton zinging around like the Road Runner. His kinetic performance doesn’t enhance the movie; it is the movie."

Take the Great Seal of the United States: The eagle clutches an olive branch in one claw, a set of 13 arrows in the other. His wings stretch out tall and wide from behind a shield, and his fulsome beak holds a ribbon inscribed with Latin: “E pluribus unum.” That is a collage of symbols about peace and war and history and unity, not a bird. A real bald eagle is made of flesh and feathers and talons — a thing of nature, not a pastiche of concepts. Noble virtues do not map neatly onto apex predators, a fact that troubled Benjamin Franklin as early as 1784. In a letter to his daughter, he wrote: “I wish the Bald Eagle had not been chosen as the Representative of our Country. He is a Bird of bad moral Character. He does not get his Living honestly.”"

The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,2017-01-20,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"It’s not common for macroeconomists to hit the list, but with “The Great Equalizer” (new at No. 8 in hardcover nonfiction), David M. Smick pulls it off.","Too Big: The word “macroeconomics” doesn’t turn up very often on the best-seller lists. That’s no surprise: With apologies to Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” was a genuine phenomenon in 2014, the field isn’t exactly sexy. But here comes David M. Smick, a “global macroeconomic strategist” (in the perky words of his official biography), whose new book, “The Great Equalizer,” argues that government should favor small businesses and entrepreneurs over big corporations; it enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8. Smick was Jack Kemp’s congressional chief of staff in the 1970s and ’80s, and he still leans Republican — he supported Marco Rubio’s presidential run and donated nearly $100,000 to Republican candidates in the last election cycle. But discussing the financial industry and its excesses, he can sound as fiery and populist as any Bernie Sanders stump speech. “The true shame of the 2008 financial crisis is that the big and the powerful were the most protected,” he writes. “It is clear why working families today are so angry. After 2008, if you were a failed, brain-dead Wall Street banker who nearly tanked the world economy, you had easy access to the Federal Reserve’s cheap liquidity. If you failed as a giant bank, you were considered special. Your bank could systemically bring down the entire financial system. But if you were a struggling enterprise out there alone with a brilliant idea that could someday employ thousands of people, obtaining financing was next to impossible. The normal sources of risk capital had dried up, but no one from Washington, D.C., was there with your safety net. The too-big-to-fail banks enjoyed a cost of borrowing far lower than other firms because financial markets became convinced government authorities would never let the big banks go under. The fix was in.”"

For her collection, Chiuri interprets the “New Look” again, in ivory organza with a peplum of pleats above wide chiffon culottes. It’s an ensemble whose inherent lightness and elastic ease of movement feels like a reflection of that juxtaposition of contemporary feminism (the slogan T-shirt) and historical throwback (the Bar jacket) currently on her own back."

We jet off to foreign countries, on dates predetermined by a higher power (yoga instructors, dietitians), to eat raw meals and practice downward dog alongside complete strangers.

This rarely happens.” Or, it could happen all the time — if you venture out to a magical place where spectacular encounters are the fabric of everyday life, as they are at Greyfield Inn on Cumberland Island."

‘Independently Blue’,2017-01-27,article,News,,['Poetry and Poets'],Selected by Matthew Zapruder.,"Julien Poirier’s work shares qualities of the New York School — casual and anarchic wit, love of high and low culture and willingness to be sentimental — but also a California surrealism. It makes sense, then, that Poirier’s recent book, “Out of Print,” is published by City Lights, the venerable San Francisco publishing house and bookstore founded in 1953. City Lights published Frank O’Hara, along with Allen Ginsberg and many others who first fused some of the same styles that Poirier continues to explore. Here, Poirier’s short poem somehow manages to capture a national mood, or at least some part of it: Bemused disgust pervades, but there remains a bit of room, perhaps, for optimism.

We couldn’t hear them watching television or smell what they cooked for supper. "
How Do You Sell a Work of Art Built Into the Earth?,2017-01-27,article,News,,['Sculpture'],"Earthworks, monumental excavations and land projects weren’t originally intended to be sold.","Almost 50 years ago, Robert Smithson, along with his fellow artists Michael Heizer, Walter De Maria and other adventurous colleagues, pioneered earthworks, an audacious — and short-lived — movement of the 20th century. Named for a sci-fi novel that Smithson read in 1967, earthworks represented a new genre of landscape art. Instead of painting a view of nature, sculptors created their own massive works outdoors on mesas, moraines and even the floor of the Mojave Desert. In 1971, Mr. Heizer told me: “You can’t really find a harsher climate than where a majority of my work exists right now. It’s in semiarid, flat, windy, heavy rainy season areas.”"

Behind the Best Sellers: A ‘Sermon’ Debuts and Karen Marie Moning’s ‘Fever’ Series Comes to an End,2017-01-27,article,List,,['Books and Literature'],"Michael Eric Dyson’s “Tears We Cannot Stop,” No. 8 in hardcover nonfiction, includes a list of recommended black musicians.","Griot Playlist: Michael Eric Dyson’s “Tears We Cannot Stop” — possibly the first book to bear promotional blurbs from both Toni Morrison and Stephen King — makes its debut on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8. Subtitled “A Sermon to White America,” the book is a stark polemic about race relations, including discussions of police shootings, affirmative action and black-on-black crime (which Dyson sees as a consequence of mere proximity, what he calls “the geography of despair”). But in keeping with an author who has previously written about Bill Cosby and the rapper Nas, among other subjects — and who contributed a list of “blue-eyed soul stars” to his recent interview with The New York Times Magazine — Dyson also makes room for extensive references to pop culture. The book is dedicated to the Knowles women (Beyoncé, Solange and Tina Knowles-Lawson) and includes an early chapter called “Hymns of Praise” in which Dyson singles out a number of politically conscious black musicians as “our griots.” It’s a smart move, since pop music has often provided a channel for white audiences to learn more about black culture. So what artists does Dyson recommend? N.W.A, KRS-One, the Fugees (and their lead singer, Lauryn Hill), Tupac Shakur, Jay Z, Kendrick Lamar and — of course — the “genius and greatest living entertainer,” Beyoncé herself. Of their songs, Dyson writes: “These and a thousand others are the hymns that answer the reign of terror that consumes our days. These are the hymns that rally us against the fantasy of our erasure. May these hymns be sung loud until our slaughter ceases and our blood no longer spills.”"

This marks the first foray into exhibiting contemporary art for Fendi, whose C.E.O., Pietro Beccari, adheres to one programming condition: “Everything should be about Italian genius and excellence.”"

Mr. Goldberg, a Chinese scholar who grew up in Spring Valley, N.Y., in Rockland County, became a professional luge racer and worked in finance before running a couple of places in Hong Kong.

At his colorful stand, cooks spread a thin film of batter made with mung bean and rice flours onto a griddle, break an egg on it, add herbs and condiments, flip it, roll it and cut it in two. He has come up with nontraditional versions with roast duck, marinated chicken or roast pork.
