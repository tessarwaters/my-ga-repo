What’s on Monday,2013-07-01,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"1:50 A.M. (STARZ) A DANGEROUS METHOD (2011) A disturbed young Russian, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), is brought to a clinic in Zurich in the early 20th century, and a doctor named Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender, above with Ms. Knightley) performs a new treatment called psychoanalysis to help her. Soon she becomes his lover and finally a colleague. But as emotionally connected as Sabina is to Jung, it is with his mentor, Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen), that she finds a more cerebral affinity. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film from David Cronenberg, based on a play by its screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, and drawn from a book by John Kerr, a “subtle and intellectually thrilling true story.” The movie “is full of ideas about sexuality — some quite provocative, even a century after their first articulation — but it also recognizes and communicates the erotic power of ideas,” he said. “There are scenes of kinky activity between Sabina and Jung that will no doubt enjoy long life in specialized corners of the Internet, but the most unsettling aspect of ‘A Dangerous Method’ may be the links it suggests between sex and thinking. The mind is both slave and master of the body’s appetites, and the absurd and terrifying task of stabilizing that dynamic, in theory and in practice, is embraced equally by the film and the fragile, serious historical figures who inhabit it.” "

What’s On Tuesday,2013-07-02,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"11 A.M. (Sundance) RAN (1985) In his masterwork inspired by Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa tells the story of Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), an exhausted 70-year-old warlord who wants to turn the vast dominion acquired through 50 years of bloodshed over to his three sons, on whose kindness he will then depend. The two older sons agree to their father’s terms and swear loyalty to him and to each other. But when the youngest argues that by dividing the lands, Hidetora is creating conditions that will lead to disaster, his father sends him into exile. At the same time, the wife (Mieko Harada, above) of his oldest son — the daughter of a lord conquered by Hidetora — encourages her husband to humiliate his father so he can assume control of the family in his own name. “Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, ‘Ran’ has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times."

Gone Girls,2013-07-03,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Murders and Attempted Murders', 'Women and Girls', 'Prostitution']",The stories of troubled young women who engaged in Internet prostitution and turned up dead on Long Island.,"In mid-December 2010, the Suffolk County police discovered the bodies of four women, each wrapped in burlap, on a desolate, bramble-covered stretch of sand called Gilgo Beach. The corpses were later identified as those of four prostitutes, Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes and Amber Lynn Overstreet Costello. The work was believed to be that of a serial killer, and for several months to come, the media circus that accompanied the official investigation — centering on the search for another prostitute, Shannan Gilbert, who had disappeared after a nearby assignation the previous May — kept much of the New York area and the nation entranced. It was a gothic whodunit for the Internet age, replete with prostitutes, drugs, family dysfunction, investigative incompetence, not to mention a strange, insular beach community and, of course, the Web sites of Craigslist and Backpage, where the women had advertised for customers. Robert Kolker, who wrote about the murders for New York magazine in 2011, has produced in “Lost Girls” a compelling, nearly unputdownable narrative of the case and its attendant issues; a horrific, cautionary tale that makes for a very different type of beach read."

What’s On Friday,2013-07-04,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: THE FILMS OF FRANÇOIS TRUFFAUT A monthlong tribute to this film critic turned director, and mainstay of the French New Wave, kicks off with four films starring Jean-Pierre Léaud, Truffaut’s on-screen alter ego. This first installment begins with “The 400 Blows” (1959), above, Truffaut’s feature film debut, in which he drew inspiration from his childhood for a story about Antoine Doinel, a 12-year-old who escapes his dysfunctional family by turning to crime. “Words cannot state simply how fine is Jean-Pierre Léaud in the role of the boy,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times. “Out of this brand-new youngster, M. Truffaut has elicited a performance that will live as a delightful, provoking and heartbreaking monument to a boy.” The homage continues at 9:45 with “Antoine and Colette,” Truffaut’s episode from “Love at Twenty” (1962) — an omnibus project featuring five segments directed by five filmmakers from five countries — and a short sequel to “The 400 Blows,” set three years later, in which Antoine has his first sentimental adventure. In “Stolen Kisses” (1968), at 10:30, Antoine, fresh out of the army, looks for work and ponders an affair with an older woman. In “Bed and Board” (1970), at 12:15 a.m., Antoine faces up to the responsibilities of adulthood. And in “Love on the Run” (1979), at 2, Antoine, now divorced, continues his search for romantic fulfillment. The night ends at 4 with “The Green Room” (1978), based in part on “The Altar of the Dead” and two other stories by Henry James, in which Truffaut stars as a writer and World War I veteran who spends his life grieving the loss of his young wife."

What’s On Friday,2013-07-12,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9:30 A.M. (Showtime 2) LIBERAL ARTS (2012) Josh Radnor (“How I Met Your Mother”), who wrote and directed this film, stars as Jesse, a 35-year-old admissions counselor at a New York City university who returns to his Ohio alma mater, where he encounters his two favorite teachers. The first is Judith (Allison Janney), a bitter, cynical professor of romantic literature, who seduces him, then throws him out of her bed. “You didn’t think we were going to cuddle while I read you Wordsworth,” she says. “Put some armor around that gooey little heart.” The second is Peter (Richard Jenkins), who is ending a 37-year career at the place he describes as a prison. Then Peter introduces Jesse to Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen, above with Mr. Radnor), an intellectually precocious 19-year-old drama student, and something clicks over the strains of Beethoven, Wagner, Vivaldi and Massenet. “ ‘Liberal Arts’ is a much stronger, more deeply felt film than Mr. Radnor’s debut, ‘Happythankyoumoreplease,’ ” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, but, “to quote the hard-boiled Judith, Mr. Radnor’s Jesse is gooey. The harder Mr. Radnor strains to make you love his alter ego, the more resistant you become. The last thing in the world you want to hear is Jesse congratulating himself for growing up, but toward the end of the movie that’s exactly what he does, with a gooey happy ending in sight.” "

Rites of Passage,2013-07-12,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Railroads', 'Travel and Vacations']",Tim Parks recounts Italian rail journeys and his encounters with people along the way.,"The British author Tim Parks has lived in Italy since 1981, commuting on his adopted country’s vast, various and ever changing networks of trains from Verona (where he first made his home) to Milan (where he now lives and still teaches). Parks was for many years married to an Italian and has three children, all born in Italy. He has written more than a dozen novels and 10 other books, including a handful of funny, appreciative and grousing memoirs about the particolari of daily life, Italian style. In the first of these, “Italian Neighbors,” he asked the reader to picture him as “a busy but inexpert fellow dashing about the narrow confines of his territory waving a net on the end of a long stick.” A “huge” net, he added. What did he hope to catch? “National character, a sense of place, the feeling people, place and weather generate.” In his new ­memoir-cum-travelogue, “Italian Ways,” Parks enlarges this net to fantastical dimensions in order to bag Italy’s sprawling, convoluted and (in a way) stupendous railway system and subject it to his scrutiny — on the theory, he explains to skeptics who don’t share his train mania, that any culture “manifests itself entirely in anything the people of that culture do.”"

Staying Afloat,2013-07-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Lives are bruised and twisted by history in Courtney Angela Brkic’s novel of a dislocated Croatian family.,"The violent history of postwar Croatia, from 1945 until the turn of the millennium, created three generations of dislocated people. Some were dislocated from home and roots: many thousands fled their homeland during the years of Yugoslav Communism, with its informers, “eliminations” and prison camps. Others, who stayed on, were dislocated from their history as the Communist authorities rewrote the past, a process that continued during the bloody Balkan wars of the 1990s. And dislocation, as always, extended into the psychological realm: timeless ideas of value and even truth were warped by decades of lies."

Now another “Star Wars” spinoff is making noise: “William Shakespeare’s Star Wars,” by Ian Doescher, is new at No. 12 on the hardcover fiction list. The book recasts the story of Luke and Leia and Darth Vader as a five-act play in iambic pentameter — because why not? — and it’s more entertaining than you might guess. (Here’s a sample couplet from the prologue: “In time so long ago begins our play / In star-crossed galaxy far, far away.”) In a phone interview, Doescher told me he came up with the idea last year, after watching the original “Star Wars” trilogy and attending the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in quick succession. “People ask me whether I see ‘Star Wars’ as a comedy or a tragedy,” he said, “but it’s really neither — it’s partly a history, like ‘Henry V,’ and partly a fantasy, like ‘The Tempest.’ ” He added that he was gratified, but not entirely surprised, by the book’s success: “Shakespeare is a popular market, and ‘Star Wars’ is a popular market,” he said. “It’s not like I was writing ‘Geoffrey Chaucer’s Ishtar.’ ”"

Lionsgate Entertainment Statement About ‘Ender’s Game’,2013-07-12,article,Text,,[],"The company issued a statement in response to questions about the views of Orson Scott Card, the writer of the book upon which the film “Ender’s Game” is based.","As proud longtime supporters of the LGBT community, champions of films ranging from “Gods and Monsters” to “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” and a company that is proud to have recognized same-sex unions and domestic partnerships within its employee benefits policies for many years, we obviously do not agree with the personal views of Orson Scott Card and those of the National Organization for Marriage. However, they are completely irrelevant to a discussion of “Ender’s Game.” The simple fact is that neither the underlying book nor the film itself reflect these views in any way, shape or form. On the contrary, the film not only transports viewers to an entertaining and action-filled world, but it does so with positive and inspiring characters who ultimately deliver an ennobling and life-affirming message. Lionsgate will continue its longstanding commitment to the LGBT community by exploring new ways we can support LGBT causes and, as part of this ongoing process, will host a benefit premiere for “Ender’s Game.”"

What’s on Saturday,2013-07-13,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) CELESTE AND JESSE FOREVER (2012) Rashida Jones portrays Celeste, and Andy Samberg (above, with Ms. Jones) is Jesse, a young married couple in Los Angeles who have split up without moving on or out in this wistful romantic comedy for which Ms. Jones wrote the screenplay with Will McCormack. She plays a hard-driving trend forecaster who lives in the house they once shared; he is a laid-back artist who now flops in the backyard studio. Though they are best friends bound by the same adolescent humor, Jesse’s lack of ambition doesn’t allow the focused Celeste to stay with him. But she can’t quit him, either — until suddenly she must. “While ‘Celeste and Jesse’ is decidedly conventional in most respects, it’s pretty swell as an exploration of a relationship between a man and a woman that’s no longer predicated by mutual desire,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Once upon a studio time, screwball comedy was where men and women redefined gender relations,” she added. “Equality between the sexes, or so it seems, turned out to be a joke killer, one reason bromances exist: if you can’t imagine women as equals, just sidestep them.” Here, she said, Ms. Jones and Mr. McCormack “have righted the sex imbalance of the bromance with a story about two people who, together and alone, express an ideal rarely seen in American movies: a man and a woman whose equality is burnished in friendship, not just in bed and marriage.” "

What’s On Thursday,2013-07-18,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (BET) MANDELA: FREEDOM’S FATHER This “BET News Special” celebrates the 95th birthday of Nelson Mandela, above, chronicling his life through film clips and interviews. In Clint Eastwood’s “Invictus” (2009), at 9, Morgan Freeman stars as Mandela, newly elected as South Africa’s first black president. Matt Damon is Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbok rugby team, a source of Afrikaner pride despised by most blacks — and the vehicle, Mandela thinks, for bringing the country’s races together. A. O. Scott, reviewing this film in The New York Times, wrote that Mr. Freeman played Mandela — a role that earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor — “with gravity, grace and a crucial spark of mischief,” and that Mr. Damon, nominated for best supporting actor, matches him “with crisp, disciplined understatement (and utter mastery of a devilishly tricky accent).” He added: “ ‘Invictus’ has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss. It’s an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership.”"

That’s in addition to activities that have long attracted residents and regulars: indulging in the local Gullah cuisine, exploring miles of nature trails, boating, tennis and swimming in the Atlantic Ocean. Plus, it’s a breeze to take a day trip to cities like Savannah and Beaufort (where much of “The Prince of Tides” was filmed), less than an hour away. Don’t know a double bogey from an eagle?

What’s On Friday,2013-07-19,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: THE FILMS OF FRANÇOIS TRUFFAUT A monthlong tribute to this film critic turned director, and mainstay of the French New Wave, continues with “The Soft Skin” (1964). The movie shows Alfred Hitchcock’s influence on Truffaut, and his own preoccupation with the romantic triangle, through the story of a literary scholar (Jean Desailly), his wife (Nelly Benedetti) and the flight attendant (Françoise Dorléac) who comes between them. The lineup continues at 10 with “Jules and Jim” (1962), adapted from Henri-Pierre Roché’s 1953 semi-autobiographical novel and starring Jeanne Moreau as a tempestuous beauty who drives a wedge between college friends (Henri Serre, above center, and Oskar Werner, with Ms. Moreau). In “Two English Girls” (1972), at midnight, a young writer (Jean-Pierre Léaud, who served as Truffaut’s alter ego as a young man) carries on love affairs with two sisters (Kika Markham and Stacey Tendeter). Truffaut shares the directing credit with Jean-Luc Godard in “A Story of Water” (1961), a short film inspired by a severe flood in Paris, at 2:15 a.m. And in “The Woman Next Door” (1981), at 2:30, former lovers (Gérard Depardieu, whom Truffaut chose as his stand-in during his later years, and Fanny Ardant, Truffaut’s real-life love at the time) find themselves unexpectedly reunited after seven years as neighbors in a French village. The marathon wraps at 4:30 with “The Man Who Loved Women” (1977), with Charles Denner as an inveterate womanizer (the beauties are portrayed by Brigitte Fossey, Nelly Borgeaud, Geneviève Fontanel and Leslie Caron, among others) who tries to make sense of his problems by writing his memoirs."

Today, he writes, it is “the most important bank in the world,” an institution with virtually no accountability, and yet “for decades it has stood at the center of a global network of money, power and covert global influence.”"
Who She Knew,2013-07-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The formidable doyenne of 19th-century expatriate Florence.,"Janet Ross was one of those Lady Bracknell-like dragons for whom the word “formidable” was practically invented. Born in London in 1842, she spent the last six decades of her life — from 1867 until her death in 1927 — as an increasingly commanding personage in the Anglo-Tuscan colony around Florence, where she was known (and feared) as Aunt Janet. Ben Downing freely acknowledges near the beginning of “Queen Bee of Tuscany” that Ross “had her limitations. Though intelligent and learned, especially for an autodidact, she was by no means brilliant. She had little imagination or inner life, and she made no towering contribution to humanity.” Thus the biog­rapher throws down his own gauntlet: Why, then, are we reading about her?"
"Exit, Voice",2013-07-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The life of the oddly obscure economist Albert O. Hirschman.,"The life that the economist Albert O. Hirschman lived in the 1980s and early ’90s was the stuff of an intellectual’s most self-aggrandizing daydreams. There were honorary degrees (at least a dozen), prestigious prizes (wouldn’t you want a Thomas Jefferson Medal from the American Philosophical Society?) and conference after conference held in his honor. It’s customary for a distinguished professor to get a “Festschrift” of writings by students and disciples; Hirschman got four. "

Academic Affairs,2013-07-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],A graduate student is obsessed with her professor’s wife in Susan Choi’s novel.,"Susan Choi’s new novel starts out on familiar territory: the attraction between a precocious young woman and an intellectually charismatic older man. Regina is a 21-year-old graduate student taking literature classes at an unnamed East Coast university; Nicholas Brodeur is her celebrated professor, graced with “exceptional, even sinister, attractiveness.” Yet “My Education,” Choi’s fourth book, only feints toward the conventional novel, with the standard affair between student and professor. Just when Regina and Nicholas seem about to sleep together, he is superseded in Regina’s affections by his 33-year-old wife, Martha, on maternity leave from a teaching position at the same university. One night at a dinner party, Regina trails the older woman out the back door and kisses her, and we find ourselves on a less familiar campus than we’d thought."

There he observed the deepening divide between the Arab north and the black Christian south, exacerbated by “demoralizing poverty” and the influence of militant Islam.

No Honeymoon,2013-07-19,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The women behind the men of NASA’s early years.,"The most iconic telling of our great national myth of space conquest, Tom Wolfe’s book “The Right Stuff,” opens with a scene of a wife frantically imagining that her husband has died. The woman, Jane Conrad, has been informed by a growing chorus of fellow officer wives that something has happened at the Jacksonville Naval Air Station, where her husband, Pete, is a test pilot. Jane knows what something means. She can all but see Pete’s mangled, charred remains lying amid the palmetto grass, the smoking wreckage of his aircraft strewn about. As the minutes tick by, she grows increasingly panicked and calls the office of Pete’s squadron. They refuse to answer her questions. She hangs up and waits for her doorbell to ring, now certain of her fate. Her husband is dead. (We learn on the next page that he is, in fact, alive. A decade and a half later, Pete Conrad walks on the moon.)"

What’s On Saturday,2013-07-20,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE BOURNE LEGACY (2012) Jeremy Renner (above), replacing Matt Damon as the lead in this fourth installment, stars as the superspy Aaron Cross, on the run when the secret intelligence campaign (code name: Outcome) that produced him is compromised, leaving Cross and his fellow operatives to be eliminated under orders from a retired Air Force Colonel (Edward Norton). Rachel Weisz plays the geneticist who helped to create Cross and who may be his only hope for staying alive. While the director Tony Gilroy “retains some of the Bourne bequest, he’s also created a tricky parallel universe with a new agency that has its own clenched-jawed, closed-door complications and a hero who nearly becomes lost among them,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about these films inspired by the Robert Ludlum novels. But while some of the action here flows nicely, she added, the three previous movies “conveyed a sense of urgency that mirrored Bourne’s shattered being and his propulsive, convulsive journey from unenlightened self-interest to accountability, from the existential question mark of his identity to a hard moral reckoning.” Jason Bourne “was still trying to find the answers,” she said. “Now with Bourne gone, Mr. Gilroy needs to find other questions worth asking.” “The Bourne Identity” (2002), the first film in the series, will be shown on A&E at 8; “The Bourne Supremacy” (2004), the second, will be shown on Starz at 7:05."

Nothing to See Here: Demoting the Uncertainty Principle,2013-07-21,article,News,,"['Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Science and Technology']",Let’s put an end to the misuse of quantum physics to validate outlandish metaphysical claims.,"“You’ve observed the robbers. They know it. That will change their actions,” says Charlie Eppes, the math savant who helps detectives on television’s “Numbers.” Eppes claims that this insight follows from quantum physics, in particular, Werner Heisenberg’s infamous “uncertainty principle.” Not all mischaracterizations of Heisenberg’s principle are as innocent as Eppes’s. The film “What the Bleep Do We Know!?” uses it to justify many articles of faith in New Age philosophy. Asserting that observing water molecules changes their molecular structure, the film reasons that since we are 90 percent water, physics therefore tells us that we can fundamentally change our nature via mental energy. Fundamentally inaccurate uses of the principle are also common in the academy, especially among social theorists, who often argue that it undermines science’s claims to objectivity and completeness. As Jim Holt has written, “No scientific idea from the last century is more fetishized, abused and misunderstood — by the vulgar and the learned alike — than Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.” "

The President’s Men,2013-07-26,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'World War II (1939-45)']","In “Rendezvous With Destiny,” Michael Fullilove tells the story of how America joined World War II by focusing on the missions of five men he identifies as Franklin Roosevelt’s “personal envoys.”","Each time an American president sends soldiers, mercenaries, jets or drones to fight abroad, those of us whose historical knowledge or memories reach back to the last century recall when this nation entered into armed conflict the old-­fashioned way, by declaring war on an enemy. Americans appear to have an endless appetite for stories about World War II, perhaps because it was the last war “declared” by Congress and the only war of the 20th century that continues to be viewed sympathetically by a majority of every segment of the population."
Count Your Blessings,2013-07-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Sarah Butler’s novel alternates between a rootless woman and the father she’s never known.,"In Sarah Butler’s first novel, “Ten Things I’ve Learnt About Love,” lists of 10 are laid down like landing pads between chapters: “Ten things I will say to my father,” “Ten things in my father’s shed,” “Ten things I thought I’d do with my life,” “Ten places I’ve had sex.” It may sound like a gimmicky approach — after all, in the world BuzzFeed and Business Insider have wrought, the list has become inescapable, manhandling written communication, making style and linguistic grace seem somehow outdated and effete. Do we really need lists in novels, too? "
The Descendants,2013-07-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],An impenetrable author gathers his three sons for a tense reunion in David Gilbert’s novel.,"“I’ve always been interested in how we travel through time,” David Gilbert says in a “conversation” included with the publicity materials for his new novel, “& Sons.” Given that his own authoritative father had once been painfully shy, Gilbert wondered what it would be like to meet one’s father in the midst of his awkward adolescence, and therein lay a promising if problematic premise for a novel. But then Gilbert gave this screw a rather broad turn: what if one’s father were a “really mythical” writer along the lines of Salinger, “vivid on the page yet impenetrable in the flesh?” If one assumes that resembling Salinger entails not only reclusiveness but also rotten parenting skills (in his case, it depends on which child you ask), then the result would be a personage like A. N. Dyer, the impenetrable writer-father at the center of Gilbert’s novel, who leaves at least one of his sons wondering how a man could be so “funny and smart” in his work, and yet such a creep in person."
It Takes the Village,2013-07-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Cathleen Schine’s novel, a free-spirited young woman in the 1960s raises her younger half brother on Charles Street.","“A boy in a world of selfish, crazy, violent, colorful adults” — that’s how precocious Fin Hadley describes “Treasure Island” and “Manchild in the Promised Land,” two books he happens to be reading in “Fin & Lady,” Cathleen Schine’s bittersweet elegy for Greenwich Village in the 1960s. It’s also a pretty good characterization of Schine’s vivid comic novel itself, and of the unconventional adventures that Fin (no relation, we are specifically told, to Huck) finds himself living."

La Lucha Continúa,2013-07-26,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Eduardo Galeano’s daybook of political and social struggle.,"One would think that Latin Americans, after all they’ve suffered, from the tortures and terrors of the Spanish Inquisition to the death squads and disappearances of the cold war, would have given up on the idea that history is redeemable.

This is unexpectedly arresting. We’re accustomed to memoirists working double time to keep our attention, giving jumped-up accounts of personal disasters while at the same time relentlessly trying to burrow their way into our hearts with lovable, self-deprecating personas. Memoir is a crowded genre, and memoirists too often behave accordingly.

He simply plows his field, and if you want to come watch, fine by him."

In “The Hand That First Held Mine” and “The Distance Between Us,” characters separated by many miles or many years turn out to be joined in ways they never anticipated. In other books, like “The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox” and “After You’d Gone,” women confined to hospital wards slowly reveal secrets that both bind and unbind their families. "
