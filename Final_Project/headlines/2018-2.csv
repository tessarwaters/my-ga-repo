Girls moan a lot and are turned on by pretty much everything a confident guy does. One particular porn scene stuck with him: A woman was bored by a man who approached sex gently but became ecstatic with a far more aggressive guy."

The animation, rendered in modes of pencils and pastels, has a gorgeous fluency to be sure. The score is by none other than John Williams, American cinema’s king of the Heroic Theme. Ultimately, “Dear Basketball” is substance-free, an advertisement for itself. It deserves to not receive an Oscar for that reason alone."

Ellsworth Kelly’s Temple for Light,2018-02-08,article,News,,"['Art', 'ARCHITECTURE']",Two years after his death — and more than 30 years in the making — the artist’s monumental installation opens in Texas.,"IN 1986, DOUGLAS S. Cramer — a producer of television shows including “Dynasty” and “The Love Boat” — asked the artist Ellsworth Kelly to design a free-standing structure on his vineyard near Santa Barbara, Calif. Cramer was a loyal collector of the artist, and wanted Kelly to make an original, large-scale artwork for his property. Kelly, who died in December 2015 at the age of 92 and whose career was defined by stripping painting and sculpture down to their elemental components of form and color, made designs for what appears from the outside to be a simple double-barrel-vaulted building, alluding to Romanesque and Cistercian religious architecture and resembling an igloo made of stucco. Inside, the artist had planned for a number of revelations. Colored-glass windows — arranged as a grid over the entrance, as a ring of tumbling squares on one side of the building, and a sunburst on the other — would bend the light in different ways. On the walls was Kelly’s take on the stations of the cross — 14 marble panels, variations on stark black-and-white abstractions. In the rear of this single-room structure, where one would expect to find the crucifix in a Christian church, would be one of Kelly’s totem sculptures — a thin column standing over the interior like a sentinel. The project eventually fell through; Kelly kept two models of the structure in his studio, though he never really believed the chapel would be built."

Along with Seth Zucker of For the Common Good (a like-minded independent publishing practice) and Kingsboro’s other co-founder, Megan Plunkett, he tracked down the manuscript. “We thought it would be exciting to read, since she’s such a evocative writer, and exciting to resurface, because she’s such a beloved underground figure,” Wagner says."

But that atrocity has been largely forgotten.,"The Battle for Hue, part of the Tet offensive, started with an assault by communist forces in the wee hours of Jan. 30, 1968. The former imperial capital of Vietnam, Hue was defended by the Army of the Republic of (South) Vietnam, local militia units, the United States Marines and the United States Air Force. The core of the communist forces in Hue was the North Vietnamese Army with support from southern communist forces — the National Liberation Front, also known as Viet Cong, and from communist sympathizers, many of whom were former members of the defunct Struggle Movement, organized in Hue in 1965 by Buddhist monks and students, which had led the Buddhist Uprising that was suppressed by the ARVN in 1966. Many Struggle Movement activists fled to the mountains and joined the communists; during the Tet Offensive, they returned to Hue with the communists."

Davis. (Scribner, $25.) Davis, the consummate Washington insider and former special counsel to Bill Clinton, offers his take on the 2016 election. In his view, the former F.B.I. director James Comey’s announcement, 11 days before the vote, that Hillary Clinton’s emails were under investigation again, dealt the fatal blow. MAKING THE MONSTER By Kathryn Harkup. (Sigma, $27.) Could Victor Frankenstein actually have succeeded in 1818, building a man out of spare parts?

It has all the trademarks of a Mamet production — electric dialogue and a hurtling pace. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH HUMANKIND By Sang-Hee Lee. (Norton, $26.95.)

Examining wisdom teeth from various periods, for example, she was able to establish how long ago our life spans first allowed us to know our grandparents.

The restaurant, named for the recording studio once housed at its address, is starting with a breakfast and lunch cafe in the front half of the space, serving what Mr. Hardy calls “chef-driven food,” not the usual muffins and egg sandwiches. It has a handsome sweep of bar for drinks and dining, and a marble bar for wine, with comfortable seating. By night this area will become a wine bar and dining counter with the same menu as the airy dining room beyond. The design, by Ken Fulk of San Francisco, suggests midcentury modern. The dinner menu is what Mr. Hardy calls “more uptown” than those at his other restaurants, with less Neapolitan fire, more Piedmontese complexity and a greater focus on seafood. The winter menu has a crudo section and dishes like crispy sunchokes with puntarelle, chestnut tagliatelle with duck ragù and duck offal, and Icelandic sea trout with pickled fennel and horseradish. Arvid Rosengren, an award-winning sommelier, is a partner here and has assembled a mostly French and Italian wine list.

But then in August, the organization abruptly traded him to the Cavs for Kyrie Irving. At the time of the first trade, Thomas was just months off a colossal playoff run in which he played through major dental surgery, a hip labral tear and the loss of his younger sister, Chyna, in a car accident. In the days after her death, Thomas suited up against the Bulls: He had Chyna’s name written on his sneakers and fat tears pooled in his eyes.

Theater Four, as the joint was called, was a dowdy old converted church in a part of Manhattan that the play’s author, Mart Crowley, called a “senseless-killing neighborhood.” But Luckinbill wasn’t lugging tools to make repairs. Instead, he drilled a hole in a piece of the set called a tormentor flat, about waist-high, so that he and his eight castmates, standing backstage, could get a glimpse of whoever was sitting sixth row center: the best seats in the house. Over the coming weeks the actors took turns peeping at the likes of Jackie Kennedy, Marlene Dietrich, Groucho Marx and Rudolf Nureyev. Even New York City’s glamorous mayor, John Lindsay, showed up."
