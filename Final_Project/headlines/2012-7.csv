Stone Links: The Rise of Café Philosophy,2012-07-03,article,News,,['Philosophy'],"In this week’s links: café philosophy, anti-secularism, marking Rousseau’s tercentenary, and more.","If philosophical debate as we know it began with Socrates’ freewheeling peregrinations through the Athenian Agora, today it’s primarily a highly specialized discipline practiced by professionals within the Ivory Tower. Jules Evans, however, thinks he sees change on the horizon. In an article at the Financial Times, Evans, a journalist and amateur philosopher who heads the 2,000 member-strong London Philosophy Club, describes an emerging scene in which people from a diverse range of backgrounds gather at cafés, pubs and pizza parlors to tackle the great philosophical questions. He also traces the historical ebb and flow of public philosophizing, from the Greeks through the Enlightenment, concluding that “such clubs flourish during periods of economic and moral crisis.” Professional philosophers are of course still welcome, and indeed, because Evans sees “a huge popular demand for academics to share their expertise,” are encouraged to participate. Ending with cautious optimism, Evans adds that to ensure that these kinds of gatherings are “more than a fashionable trend,” they will have to find the “shared ethical commitments” that are necessary to “create genuine communities.”"

Samuel Adams, the hotheaded patriot, called on me in the meeting hall. On many occasions during the years before our independence was declared 236 years ago, Adams had, no doubt, run similarly fiery meetings, honing his rhetorical skills, learning just how to set mobs into action. Even when the moderates among Boston’s merchants had been satisfied by compromises with George III and the British Parliament, he fueled more radical ambitions for independence.

Vain Glorious | Virtual Workouts,2012-07-05,article,News,,[],The virtual fitness world offers live streams of everything from kickboxing to barre and step classes.,"I first learned about live-stream workouts when I took my first class (in person) at Ballet Beautiful, in SoHo. Mary Helen Bowers, a former dancer for the New York City Ballet and founder of the ballet-inspired isolated-muscle fitness regimen, was busy performing inner-thigh reps alongside her laptop. As I made small talk (I was early for class), I noticed that she was politely juggling my chitchat with someone on the other end of the computer screen. Soon after, a classmate warned Bowers that she would be away the following week but would tune in to her workout from her hotel room. The idea, explains Bowers, who almost always leads the class, was born out of necessity. “I had the opportunity to train with Natalie Portman for ‘Black Swan,’ and the program we created was intense and involved a lot of travel.” So to stay in touch with my New York clients during that period, my solution was to work them out online.” Like Portman, who is still a Ballet Beautiful regular, other celebrities have begun to prefer the privacy of exercising remotely. Rumor has it that Lady Gaga does her Soul Cycle spin sessions on the road via recorded classes. (Soul Cycle will have streaming content in the next six to eight months.) “It’s a new experience in fitness,” points out Bowers, who charges $35 per broadcasted class or $280 per month for unlimited access. “Not only is it happening live but it’s interactive, so there’s a social element to it.”"

Companies sometimes added special mouthpieces — called beauty tips, often made of cork — for women. After all, what seductress would want to be seen picking tobacco flecks off her tongue? In the early 1950s, when scientific reports showed just how dangerous smoking could be, tobacco companies scrambled to add mouthpieces to most cigarettes, hiring labs at Dow and DuPont to design them. In 1952, the Kent Micronite came equipped with a filter that sucked particles out of the smoke — “Here’s proof you can see. . . . Kent gives greater protection than any other cigarette,” the ad read. But the Micronite contained asbestos fibers that were far more dangerous than tobacco smoke. Philip Morris promised that an antifreeze chemical (diethylene glycol) in the mouthpiece would take “the FEAR out of smoking.” And DuPont scientists tried to trap harmful particles with new fabrics, including Dacron, the same polyester that allowed for wrinkle-free pantsuits."

As the group strategized, Frank Whetstone, a newspaper publisher from Montana, stood up and said while he trusted White (a resolute insurgent who masterminded Goldwater’s nomination), he wondered “where the rest of you s.o.b.’s will be when we get down to that final ballot.” It was a valid question. A previous attempt to get Goldwater the nomination, in 1960, had been a flop. This time the campaign would be serious. The men in the room, David B. Frisk reports in “If Not Us, Who?,” “pledged to stick with their comrades, whatever pressures might be brought.” "

Only the rascal talking your ear off is Gregg Allman, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and founding member of the Allman Brothers Band. When you first pick up this autobiography (written with Alan Light), you might think the title “My Cross to Bear” more than a little self-pitying; after all, martyrdom is best conferred by others. But after you finish reading it, you’ll probably think that, while it’s unlikely anyone will base a religion on the sufferings of a millionaire rock star, Gregory LeNoir Allman passed a night in Geth­semane and then some.

Port of Dreams,2012-07-06,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Jess Walter’s sweeping novel, characters follow their aspirations for success and love.","It is April 1962. A beautiful blond American actress, a dying beautiful blond American actress, mysteriously arrives alone and by boat to the dock of “a rumor of a town,” the fictitious Porto Vergogna on the Italian coast south of Genoa. She is 22-year-old Dee Moray, fresh off the Roman film set of “Cleopatra” — the scandal-ridden Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton epic, which, with a budget at about 300 million of today’s dollars, is among the most expensive movies ever made. This young woman’s charmed entrance into this tiny village, which is accessible only by water, captures the attention of Pasquale Tursi, the azure-eyed, even younger proprietor of an empty pen­sione, the “Hotel Adequate View.” “Chest-deep in daydreams” and also seawater, Pasquale, who aspires to turn the village into a resort town, has taken on the Sisy­phean task of trying to build a beach out of “the rocky, shrimp-curled cove” by getting wet and digging the stones out of the inlet by hand. He holds a big rock beneath his chin and watches in “a burst of clarity after a lifetime of sleep” as Dee ascends onto the pier. She smiles at him and Pasquale falls in love, and “would remain in love for the rest of his life — not so much with the woman, whom he didn’t even know, but with the moment.”"

It’s become Matthews’s own ethos: “I like to remind myself that I’m company to people,” he said in a recent phone conversation. “After you provide analysis, information and opinion, you offer company. Viewers turn you on for an hour every night. You’re in their home. You’re their company, and being company is a big deal.” And what’s the hallmark of being a good guest? “Regard,” Matthews said. “Being loyal to the viewers and remembering to bring the conversation to them and including them in the conversation. That’s the intuition in the business.”"

Inside the List,2012-07-06,article,News,,"['Books and Literature', 'Income Inequality']","Two best-selling authors, Joseph E. Stig­litz and Edward Conard, debate their drastically different views of America’s income gap.","UNEQUAL EXCHANGE: For a few weeks now, two drastically different arguments about America’s income gap have been bouncing around the hardcover nonfiction list. In “The Price of Inequality” (currently at No. 27 on the extended list), the Columbia professor and Nobel-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz makes the case that the growing gulf between haves and have-nots is a drag on the economy and a drain on society. Meanwhile, in “Unintended Consequences” (at No. 12), the former Bain Capital managing director Edward Conard says inequality is healthy and America could use more of it. This is a political dispute as much as an economic one, of course: Conard is close to his old Bain colleague Mitt Romney, and Stiglitz was chairman of President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers from 1995 to 1997. But basic economic theories are also at play. Who’s right? I’m not qualified to judge — I was a French major — but the books are in such perfect, symmetrical opposition that I’ve been a little surprised not to see their authors duking it out on every Sunday morning talk show. So I figured I’d give them the chance here. A condensed version of this exchange will be published in the July 15 Book Review."

The structure, perched on this 8,100-foot-high pass where the snowy seams of Switzerland, Italy and France converge, has a storied history: it was founded by St. Bernard himself, is the birthplace of the iconic dog bred by the monks, and it provided room and board for illustrious visitors like Napoleon and Alexandre Dumas.

Simply Stella,2012-07-10,article,News,,['Lingerie and Underwear'],A new line of everyday lingerie from Stella McCartney launches in August.,"My mother always said that a woman should never be frugal when it comes to face creams and lingerie.

Stella McCartney is now solving one of these dilemmas with a new line of everyday lingerie called Stella. “Well-made lingerie is key,” says the designer, whose frilly, pretty main line’s underthings already have an adoring audience. “Feeling constricted by one’s underwear just isn’t my thing; you need to rely on the quality. It has to fit, function and do its job first and foremost.” Available in August, the Stella collection includes five different bra shapes including molded underwire, low plunge cups, a strapless style and a seamless, underwire-free style — in youthful pops of electric blue or python and more timeless hues of blush pink or black — all made from organic cotton and recycled metal (for the strap’s gold Stella-encrusted rings).

Times reviews Jim Holt’s “Why does the World Exist?” Holt is concerned, naturally enough, to address the question of the book’s title, but in an idiosyncratic and personal way (It’s subtitled “An Existential Detective Story”). He pursues the question—traditionally formulated by philosophers as, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” — through conversations with a range of eminent thinkers. Among them are the physicists Roger Penrose and Steven Weinberg, the novelist John Updike, the theologian Richard Swinburne and the philosopher John Leslie. Along the way, Holt suggests that cosmology is still conceptually stuck in its religious past, where the existence of the world is just assumed to require an explanation: “When we ask why there is something rather than nothing at all, we are, wittingly or not, heirs to a way of thinking that is a vestige of early Judeo-Christianity.” Also interesting is how the concepts of goodness and perfection end up figuring in Holt’s metaphysical inquiry: one critical modern source for this injection of normativity, says Holt, is Leibniz and his notion of our living, necessarily, in the best of all possible worlds."

This Is London,2012-07-12,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],John Lanchester’s novel follows the residents of one London street during an era of easy money.,"In “Capital,” a modern offshoot of juicy social satires like Trollope’s novel “The Way We Live Now,” John Lanchester puts two of his characters in a compartment of the London Eye, the Ferris wheel that went up on the south bank of the Thames to celebrate the millennium. It’s the spring of 2008, a sunny day for once, and a Polish builder named Zbigniew and a Hungarian nanny named Matya are on a date. Though Britain is reeling from the double whammy of global economic woes and terrorism jitters, Zbigniew and Matya take in their bird’s-eye view with no special feeling of unease, apart from a twinge of motion sickness. On terra firma, both work for wealthy homeowners on a gentrified street called Pepys Road in the up-and-coming South London neighborhood of Clapham. At the beginning of the 21st century, before the bursting of the real estate bubble, property values on Pepys Road had soared — even for the modest end house, owned by a Muslim family, that holds a corner shop, and even for the crumbling terraced house owned by an elderly grandmother, which hasn’t had a change of linoleum, wall­paper or electrical wiring in 50 years. Owning property there, Lanchester writes, “was like being in a casino in which you were guaranteed to be a winner.” Lately, though, all is not well on Pepys Road. The high rollers’ holiday bonuses aren’t secure, cash in hand is getting scarce, and ominous postcards have been arriving in every mail slot, reading: “We Want What You Have.” If that weren’t alarming enough, a young man in a hoodie has been seen lurking in the dawn hours. We all know what that means."

She pulls over, approaches cautiously and hears from inside the car a woman’s voice — not screaming or moaning, but “a sort of muttering,” in “a low, conversational tone.” The windshield is shattered in such a way as to have turned opaque, and the injured driver cannot be seen; Frances’ image of her is formed entirely by her “expensive, cultured voice,” and by a kind of upper-class conversational refinement that even an apparent head injury cannot undermine. Frances, while neither a doctor nor a paramedic — she is just a “subeditor,” which is to say copy editor, in the beleaguered books section of a downsizing London newspaper called The Questioner — does unflinchingly what little she can: first she phones for an ambulance, and then she stays beside the car and talks soothingly with the trapped woman, whose name is Alice, until Alice’s frightened yet still genteel voice turns unintelligible. The police arrive and, shortly afterward, Alice dies of her injuries."

Jay pursues Trishna and then abandons her, literally and emotionally, only to return to her arms amid a great deal of melodramatic busyness, pulsing colors, churning dust and very little heat. "

Iris is unsure what the firm does, beyond delivering vague letters to “clients” and producing long strings of unconnected numbers. What’s more troubling is that the place seems to be emptying out around her. Co-workers are disappearing. Offices are abruptly abandoned, shut up, her colleagues replaced by piles of broken or obsolete office equipment, “things that are no longer things, but not yet trash.” Her boss vanishes for longer and longer periods, days, weeks at a time, turning up for brief interludes to perform suspicious activities — like hiding envelopes in the floorboards — only to go missing right out of his office just as Iris comes in with the supplies he’s requested."

Holly Golightly’s assertion that nothing bad can ever happen to you at Tiffany’s resonates because it seems instinctively true.

Matheson hopes that making dressier clutches easier for young women to access will encourage a new way of thinking about what they carry and when. “We have to be retrained to think about wearing going-out bags for date nights, girls’ night out, drinks after work, you name it,” she says. “We make a shoe change, add lipstick and, now, should switch our bag.” Not unlike our grandmothers before us. “They had it right!” Matheson says."

Congress Confiscates Confederates’ Slaves,2012-07-17,article,News,,"['Civil War (US) (1861-65)', 'Law and Legislation', 'Slavery', 'United States Politics and Government']","It is easy to overlook the contributions of the 37th Congress, which was elected alongside Lincoln in 1860.","On July 17, 1862, the last day of the congressional session, President Lincoln signed into law “An Act to suppress Insurrection, to punish Treason and Rebellion, to seize and confiscate the Property of Rebels, and for other Purposes,” commonly known as the Second Confiscation Act. That same day, Lincoln also signed a Militia Act, which authorized the enlistment of “persons of African descent” to serve in the Union military as laborers “or any other military or naval service for which they may be found competent.” Together, the measures were important markers in the fitful transformation of the war for the Union into a war of emancipation — a war in which ex-slaves and free blacks would play important roles.

J.Crew’s New Jeans,2012-07-19,article,News,,['Fashion and Apparel'],"Meet the Jenny: a classic five-pocket made of selvage denim, created by Goldsign’s designer-guru Adriano Goldschmied.","The latest addition to J. Crew’s curated “In Good Company” collection comes from Goldsign, the Los Angeles jeans brand founded by the denim industry’s designer-guru Adriano Goldschmied. The item: a classic five-pocket called Jenny made of selvage denim that is “in between a sexy jean and a boyfriend jean,” Goldschmied says. Available in two washes — a dark vintage and a lighter shade with a green cast — the one-year-old style was originally inspired by a pair worn by Norma Jeane Baker in photographs taken by André de Dienes in the 1940s. Just like those jeans, the Jenny has a straight side seam, a high waist and a cuff (that’s easy to undo, as shown here). “Back then women were buying men’s jeans and rolling them up,” Goldschmied explains. “I was in some way a little bit tired of the skinny that was born in L.A. and that’s been very successful. I was looking for what’s next. My way of designing is about starting from something that’s part of a tradition and not just replicating it but innovating through fabric, fit and wash.” It’s a lot like what J. Crew does with American classics like striped tees and khakis: it twists and turns them through styling into more forward-thinking fashion. “J. Crew and I have a lot of things in common,” Goldschmied acknowledges."

A remake of a 1940 film by Marcel Pagnol, it turns on a humble young woman, Patricia (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey), who’s literally swept off her feet and across a stream by a grocer’s son, Jacques (Nicolas Duvauchelle). By the time he puts her down, their lives have inexorably changed and she seems on her way to becoming one of fiction’s female martyrs, an innocent sacrificed on the altar of social hypocrisy and an authorial need to lecture on such hypocrisy.

It’s startling, 50 years on, to look back at the work of Mailer in the 1960s — from “The Presidential Papers” to “The Armies of the Night” — and see such unabashed ambition, such reckless audacity and such a stubborn American readiness to try to save the Republic from itself and bring it back to its original promise. Mailer’s very titles — “Advertisements for Myself,” “An American Dream” — told us he was on a mission, committed to the transformation of country and self, and even as he gave himself over to unremittingly private (and epic) meditations on God, the Devil, cancer and plastics, he was also determined to remake the civic order. He ran for mayor of New York City, he tried his hand at directing movies and in 1955 he helped start an alternative weekly known as The Village Voice. Part of the exhilaration of Mailer was that he cared so ravenously even when he failed; he was shooting for the moon even when he shot himself in the foot."

Rainbow Merit Badge,2012-07-20,article,Op-Ed,,['Homosexuality'],"The Boy Scouts’ unregenerate straights-only status is especially poignant, given that the organization’s founder was probably a gay man himself.","WITH more and more American institutions becoming inclusive and even openly gay-friendly, the Boy Scouts of America has just reaffirmed its unregenerate straights-only status: a special committee, formed in 2010, recently announced the organization’s intention of sticking with the 2000 Supreme Court decision that it is within its constitutional rights to exclude gays from leadership roles. All this is richly ironic in view of the fact that the founder of the Boy Scouts, Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell (raised to the peerage as Lord Baden-Powell) was in probability a gay man himself — though closeted, of course, considering the circumstances. A Victorian military hero who skyrocketed to fame after his valiant defense of the besieged city of Mafeking during the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell was one of the British Empire’s most adulated soldiers, looked to as the very model of muscular Christianity. Baden-Powell, the author of the hugely popular and influential “Scouting for Boys” (1908), inspired a national cult of manliness even as he entertained serious worry about his own sexuality."

The people at the inner core need to be more widely known because they will hover for decades to tutor future Democratic leaders and hound Republicans. The most trusted of them occupy key slots on the National Security Council staff, while the next tier fill top positions in the Defense and State Departments. They are centrists, not ideologues like the neoconservative Republicans who preceded them. Strikingly, however, they do not cling religiously to the middle ground come what may.

Now Collaborating | VPL + Anthropologie,2012-07-27,article,News,,[],A new inner-as-outer wear collection offers a good reason to keep investing in summer clothes.,"VPL designer Victoria Bartlett is giving girls one very good reason to keep investing in summer clothes: a new collaborative inner-as-outer wear collection with Anthropologie called UV_UnderVisibles. Inspired by the work of the Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher, Bartlett created an 18-piece collection starring six subtle micro-prints — a definite departure from her own large-scale graphics. “We had never worked with such small patterns for VPL, so it was quite exciting,” says the designer, who, in some cases, downsized and softened her main line’s bigger patterns to make sweeter ones, like the pink and melon repeat on a bra and high-waisted underpant set. “We found this type of print really worked with the sporty energy of the UV line.” Indeed, though cheerful and pretty, the pieces also hit an athletic note with a price point that will please a young shopper’s budget. Bras and underwear start at $68 and $48; chemises and camisoles go for $128 and $98, respectively. As one of Anthropologie’s monthly collaborations with independent designers, the collection will be available online for under 10 weeks after its July 30 unveiling. “It’s based in the roots of VPL, which lie in the desire to bridge the gap between inner and outerwear,” Bartlett says. Given recent temperatures, we might lean toward wearing it like the latter."

H. Auden: “Form looks for content, content looks for form.” It’s a pithy bit of near tautology that also happens to neatly describe Skinner’s thoughtful and genre-defying book. Skinner has not led a typical poet’s life, to the extent that there is such a thing. Raised in the quintessentially American working-­class enclave of Levittown, on Long Island, he spent many years as a private investigator before landing, later in life than most professional poets, in academia. His book — at once a memoir, how-to, advice column, stand-up act, confession and, most of all, ode to the art form — edifies and entertains while reflecting on the unexpected turns that poets’ lives are bound to take."
