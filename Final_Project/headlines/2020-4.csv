Joseph: An Excerpt",2020-04-06,article,Review,,[],"An excerpt from “The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.,” by Peniel E. Joseph","Malcolm X inherited the legacy of his parents, Earl Little and Louise Norton Little, proud disciples of the legendary Jamaican organizer Marcus Garvey. Malcolm grew up in a home that celebrated black pride, boldly proclaimed black dignity, and brandished political activism as practically a familial birthright. The members of the Little family were pioneer black nationalists who endeavored to follow Garvey’s dictum of establishing black political power across urban and rural American landscapes. Garvey tapped into deep currents of black political radicalism swirling in a newly reconfigured urban American landscape, one populated by black southern migrants and Caribbean immigrants. The Great Migration, which started between the world wars and crested in the immediate years after blacks won the right to vote, dispersed millions of southern migrants across the nation’s vast expanse, in the process creating archipelagoes of black cultural and political power in small and large cities. Inspired by the bootstrap racial uplift politics of Booker T. Washington and intrigued by anti-colonial rhetoric, Garvey promoted a philosophy of black nationalism that he offered, like Promethean fire, to any black person courageous enough to take it."

When Olvera opened his first restaurant in Mexico City in 2000, he called it Pujol, a slurring of the childhood nickname. In many ways, soup has been a throughline in Olvera’s culinary life. He has said that his grandmother’s puchero, made from vegetables and cheap cuts of meat, is the first dish that he remembers eating. Other staples of her kitchen were a lentil soup with plantains and bacon and a vegetable soup made with potatoes, carrots, zucchini and whatever else was good and in season. “My grandfather really liked soups, so we always had them at home,” Olvera says. “He found them heartwarming.”"

Since that day, much has changed: how we think about grass-roots organizing, the ways in which community among marginalized groups is cultivated and fostered, the life expectancy and treatment of people living with H.I.V. and AIDS. While many of the issues the group labored to address also persist, ACT UP has created an indelible blueprint for on-the-ground activism that has paved the way both for other movements, including Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, and for subsequent generations of L.G.B.T.Q. people to continue to fight, unrelentingly, for justice."

But instead of making cranes or flowers, she preferred to transform the sheets of printed paper into utilitarian objects, like boxes. “There was something about the ingenuity of a flat object being folded up to be 3-D in order to hold something,” says Ping, 41. One day, inspired by Angus MacGyver, the resourceful secret agent and titular character of the 1980s television series — “He was always finding solutions with little more than chewing gum and a toothpick,” says Ping — she folded a paper tea set for her dolls. “My mom was so annoyed,” she says of the water-soaked mess that ensued. Another creation that stands out in Ping’s mind is a paper boat she made, and that her father, who’d trained as a mechanical engineer, improved upon with side panels made from leftover paper — suddenly, the ordinary canoe was a catamaran. “It even had a canopy,” Ping recalls. “I was like, Oh my god.

And “Trolls World Tour” is available for digital rental.,"THE LIGHTHOUSE (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are given little but each other for company in “The Lighthouse.” The film casts that pair as Winslow and Wake, two 19th-century lighthouse keepers on a small, secluded island off the New England coast. It’s a claustrophobic experience for the characters and audiences alike: Directed by Robert Eggers and filmed in black-and-white, the grimly funny film shows the two men spending their days fighting and drinking, growing closer together even as they antagonize each other. The plot “is thin enough to invite plentiful interpretations about masculinity, homosocial relations and desire,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The movie’s “more sustained pleasures,” she added, “are its form and style, its presumptive influences (von Stroheim’s ‘Greed,’ German Expressionism), the frowning curve of Winslow’s mustache, the whites of eyes rolled back in terror.”"

The dad to be a bit out of touch. Some of those things are just part of what family is. I want people to realize that that dysfunction is part of our functionality.”"

How Egg Freezing Went Mainstream,2020-04-17,article,News,,"['Egg Donation and Freezing', 'ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION', 'In Vitro Fertilization', 'Parenting']",Men could easily freeze their sperm since the 1970s. So why did it take so long to figure out how to successfully freeze a woman’s eggs?,"In 1989, Dr. Debra Gook had just started working in in vitro fertilization at the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, when a close friend received a cancer diagnosis. “One of the things she regretted was that she could never have a family,” Dr. Gook said. At the time, there was only one fertility-preservation possibility for women who faced sterility from damaging treatments like chemotherapy and radiology: to freeze embryos beforehand. For single women, that meant a flurry of rushed decision-making. They’d have to choose donor sperm in the short window they had leading up to cancer treatment. Men, on the other hand, could freeze their sperm easily, an option widely available since the 1970s. “Why is it that she couldn’t have this when it was available to men?” Dr. Gook recalled thinking."

"‘Man of My Time,’ by Dalia Sofer: An Excerpt",2020-04-17,article,Review,,[],"An excerpt from “Man of My Time,” by Dalia Sofer","By the time of my arrival, in the summer of 1960, my father had been at work on his encyclopedia for nearly a decade. If I had to associate a smell with childhood, it would be the scent of buckram and paper—not the innocuous kind found in stationers, but from moldy manuscripts piled up in every corner of his office, the largest room in our small apartment on Pahlavi Street. My mother, who still only half-jokingly called herself Monir Farahani Ed Dowleh—this last obsolete suffix a reference to her supposed aristocratic heritage—endured his mania with the pragmatism of a jockey putting up with her thoroughbred’s quirks. Though she claimed she was from old money, she had reconciled herself to the fact that having married an academic, the best she could now hope for was not wealth, but recognition from the band of university highbrows she couldn’t tolerate. Her father, Ardeshir Khan Farahani, a man with a Shah Abbas–style mustache who was our family’s supplier of French porcelain, had cut off all financial support, as he had never cared much for his impractical son-in-law likening him to Don Quixote and calling him “Don Mozaffarian, man of Shatt al-Arab.” This moniker, a reference to the circumstances of my father’s birth, was an unconcealed attempt to estrange him: my father had been born two weeks early on a ferry crossing the contested river named “Shatt al-Arab” by our Arab neighbors and “Arvand Roud” by us. The exact spot of the birth, as the ferryman later described it, was past the juncture with the Karun but before the fork of the Tigris and the Euphrates, leaving my grandparents, who in those days lived in my grandmother’s province of Khuzestan, with a harrowing story and a stateless baby. And even though the matter was eventually resolved and a birth certificate was issued, my father, throughout his life, was branded with a fishy provenance teetering on the border of an Arab land."

It rhymed with chai. He was looking at his wife’s breasts in a photograph. They were tight and perky in the white spandex top she wore. Below that, her bikini bottom was just a patch of cloth in the front, held up by thin strings tied into a small bow. She was sitting on the white sheets of an unmade hotel bed and looking straight at the camera, her knees tucked underneath her. The school bus driver thought his wife looked odd in these vacation pictures. She’d never posed this way before, for him. Her black hair was set in big soft curls and she looked like a child’s doll: blue eyelids, long artificial eyelashes, round rosy cheeks, red lips. She would never, on her own, make herself up like this. This bikini would never be something she’d choose for herself. “Hee keyow,” she would say, shaking her head in disapproval if he ever suggested she wear anything even slightly revealing. This bikini must have been Frank’s idea."
"‘The Moment of Tenderness,’ by Madeleine L’Engle: An Excerpt",2020-04-21,article,Review,,[],"An excerpt from “The Moment of Tenderness,” by Madeleine L’Engle","I was about nine years old, curiously but quietly poking about my grandmother Madeleine L’Engle’s manuscripts so as not to disturb her writing and risk losing the privilege of keeping her company in her “Ivory Tower” while she worked. The Tower was just a room over the garage in the eighteenth-century New England farmhouse where she and my grandfather had lived and raised three children during the 1950s and where they still spent weekends, holidays, and long stretches of summer. I’m not sure who christened it “the Tower,” but the name was used ironically by both her and the rest of the family, an acknowledgment of the privilege of solitude and time. The manuscripts I was poking about in were housed in repurposed ream boxes with words like “Eaton” and “Corrasable Bond” on the sides, and in black three-ring binders whose leather casings were beginning to crack. There were dozens of boxes and binders, including ones with A Wrinkle in Time, The Arm of the Starfish, and A Wind in the Door written on them, but I wasn’t interested in the manuscripts of stories that could be read as real books: I was more curious about the scraps and stories and studies in the other boxes. I came across “Gilberte Must Play Bach” in one of those. I’m not sure why I stopped to read this particular one, but I liked the French name in the title, and the imperative. The story was strange to me, and sad, and although the girl in the story was named Claudine, I understood it to be autobiographical. The sadness of the story—and its unresolvedness—shook me and gave me a glimpse at the depth of things we might discover about the people we love."

It’s estimated that 20 million victory gardens flourished in the United States that year, and New York City alone produced 200 million pounds of tomatoes, beans, beets, carrots and lettuce. Seventy-seven years later, as millions of Americans are self-quarantined, and many worry about trips to the grocery store and the strength of the food-supply chain, the coronavirus pandemic has revived the victory-garden movement. “There is a simple, beautiful logic to having food security within your own home,” says David Godshall, the principal of the Los Angeles- and San Francisco-based landscape architecture studio Terremoto. “In my lifetime, I don’t think there’s ever been a more pertinent moment to start gardening.” For those wondering what will thrive in a limited outdoor space, the short answer is lots. A small garden on a rooftop or balcony can produce abundant harvests. Even inside, a sunny windowsill can yield fragrant clouds of herbs such as mint, lemon verbena, thyme, rosemary and Thai basil. Below, a handful of urban-garden experts explain how to grow your own food in a space of any size."

Two Exhibitions Respond to Art in the Age of Anxiety and Distance,2020-04-24,article,News,,"['Art', 'Anxiety and Stress', 'Quarantines']","George Condo and Rashid Johnson talk about their new simultaneous digital shows, politics and how the role of artists has changed.","The artists George Condo and Rashid Johnson are old friends who both debuted new work in simultaneous online exhibitions for Hauser & Wirth gallery that opened last week. Condo, 62, first emerged in the early 1980s as a figurative painter whose portraits walked a line between realism and sardonic conceptualism. His new show, “Drawings for Distanced Figures,” explores how changes in perspective distort his subjects. Johnson, 42, first gained attention in the early 2000s for photographs, sculptures and paintings that explored identity in 21st-century America. His show, “Untitled Anxious Red Drawings,” revisits his “Anxious Men” figures — square-jawed faces with wide eyes and chattering teeth — which have become a staple of his work. (A portion of proceeds from both shows will benefit the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund.) Like everyone, both artists have had to adapt to a new set of circumstances in the last few months that has made them see their art — not to mention their respective creative processes — differently.
