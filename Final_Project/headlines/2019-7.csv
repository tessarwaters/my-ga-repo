The branch of Hutong about to open in the Bloomberg L.P. headquarters is in a courtyard, to be sure, but it has turned the far-from-humble space that housed Le Cirque into a statement of jaw-dropping Art Deco grandeur, with a soaring blue and silver dining room and white marble details. “I consider New York to be the Art Deco capital, and I wanted to pay homage to it and also to Art Deco of Shanghai,” said David Yeo, the founder of the Hong Kong-based Aqua Restaurant Group, which owns this Hutong, as well as others in London and Asia. He said his mandate for Robert Angell, the designer, was “no red lanterns, no stereotypes.” This branch contrasts with the one in London, on 33rd floor of the Shard building, which has an Imperial Palace profusion of gilt, black and red. Mr. Yeo’s Hutong restaurants specialize in Northern Chinese food, so expect impressive platters heaped with crisp soft-shell crabs, chile-fueled beef tenderloin ma la style, the inevitable Peking duck and, specifically for New York, deep-fried prawns with pickled vegetables, broad beans with Sichuan sauce, and squid “flowers” with chile dressing. In the evening, dim sum are served in the warmly lit contemporary bar and the dining room. It will also be served for lunch, which starts in a week. (Opens Monday) "

None of that will intimidate Kyrgios, the enigmatic player who can throw tantrums one minute and make subliminally difficult shots the next. Kyrgios has beaten Nadal three times, including in the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2014, when Nadal was the No. 1 seed. After Kyrgios defeated Nadal at the Acapulco Open in February, Nadal said he “lacks respect for the crowd, his opponent and towards himself.” Kyrgios lived up to this description in his first-round match, a five-set spectacle against Jordan Thompson, in which he alternated between joking with the crowd, admonishing himself for poor decision making, and trying to be conciliatory. Late Wednesday night, Kyrgios was even spotted by reporters at a Wimbledon Village bar. It’s hard to know which version of Kyrgios will show up Thursday, but, at the least, you can expect a match full of scorching forehands and high emotions under the watchful eye of the Centre Court crowd."
What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Stranger Things’ and Fireworks,2019-07-04,article,News,,"['Television', 'Movies']",“Stranger Things” returns for a third season on Netflix. And Macy’s Fourth of July celebration broadcasts from New York.,"STRANGER THINGS Stream on Netflix. After a bit over a year and a half off, the 1980s are back. Or at least the ’80s as shown through the Spielbergian lens of this Netflix sci-fi horror series, which follows a group of Midwestern youths coming-of-age in a town that exists in the shadow of the supernatural. Season 2 ramped up the emotion and romance amid the chaos. Season 3 finds the friends in the summer between middle school and high school — so it’ll probably be downright terrifying. (In an interview with The New York Times, the actor Cary Elwes, who plays the town mayor this season, mentioned “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” as a primary influence for Season 3.) The neon nostalgia factor runs high.  “I always wonder if Apple iPhones and all these electronics that we use today are still going to be a thing in like 10, 20 years,” the actor Noah Schnapp, who plays one of the friends, recently told The Times. “It’s nice being on set, because it teaches you, oh, you don’t need your phone all the time.

We often encourage people new to the crossword by telling them that this is all skill-based, acquired knowledge, and the more you solve the easier it gets. That applies to “experts” too; as we hone our pattern-recognition and deductive skills, even highly original and eccentric puzzles get less challenging over all, although I think that at this level the difficulty varies more from solver to solver depending on personal interests."

What’s on TV Saturday: ‘The Crimes of Grindelwald’ and ‘Clique’,2019-07-13,article,News,,"['Movies', 'Television']",The latest installment in the “Fantastic Beasts” series airs on HBO.

Our resident “magizoologist,” Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), sets out to stop the menacing wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp in true Depp form) from disrupting the peace between magical and nonmagical beings and sparking a movement of pure-blood wizard domination. (The metaphors are hard to miss.)

While this Oscar-winning drama about Neil Armstrong touches on the space race and the political issues the moon landing raised at home, it focuses on the personal and professional setbacks Armstrong overcame before taking that small step in 1969. “Feelings are the film’s fuel,” A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. “Like some of the ancient epics ‘First Man’ is primarily a character study, a space odyssey with a diffident and enigmatic Ulysses at its center."" Ryan Gosling, collaborating with “La La Land” director Damien Chazelle for the second time, portrays the astronaut in the years leading up to the Apollo 11 launch. The screenplay draws from James R. Hansen’s biography and contrasts Armstrong’s reserved, hard-to-read temperament with the larger-than-life job he has shouldered.

How to Dive for Pearls,2019-07-23,article,News,,"['Mussels', 'Pearls']",Feel for the mussels in the muddy riverbed. Check the ones with misshapen shells. Don’t expect to make a living this way.,"“Run your hands back and forth through the sediment at the bottom of the river,” says Chuck Work, who has spent much of the last 25 years underwater, crawling the muddy bed of the Tennessee River, feeling for mussels with his hands. Misshapen shells are much likelier to contain freshwater pearls than more uniform ones. Open any deformed bivalve you find by sticking a knife in its hinge. “Twist the blade and it pops open,” Work says. Squeeze the soft meat in your hand, feeling for something hard. On a typical day, Work will collect as many as 1,500 mussels and check only a few for pearls; his more dependable pay comes from selling the shells to a company that ships them to China and Japan, where they are cut into tiny pieces and forced into oysters, becoming the nuclei of cultured pearls. Only about one in 10,000 mussels contains a commercially valuable wild pearl. “You can’t make a living diving for pearls,” Work says. “Think of them as a bonus.”"

Contemporary Fare at Red Paper Clip in the West Village,2019-07-23,article,News,,"['Restaurants', 'Cooking and Cookbooks']","Billy Durney’s latest, natural wines with French ties, and more restaurant news.","There’s no sign, but you might spot the red neon paper clip hanging high in the window of this very particular new restaurant. The chefs and partners, Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, decided to incorporate the word “red,” often used in China, in the name, which also refers to the story, already an internet chronicle, of Kyle MacDonald, who parlayed a red paper clip into a two-story house after a series of trades. “It’s our philosophy, always moving forward, moving up,” Mr. Chen said. So far, the two men, who have no formal culinary training and met while working several years ago at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, have gone from the bottom of the professional kitchen ladder to working in New York establishments like Soho House; One if by Land, Two if by Sea; and the Dutch, as well as Alinea, in Chicago, and Apis, near Austin, Tex. Before opening Red Paper Clip, a bootstrap affair with no backers, they held pop-up dinners in various places, including an Upper West Side apartment. Mr. Chen, 29, a New Yorker whose parents are from Taiwan, and Mr. Gyamtso, also 29, a Tibetan who came to New York in 2008, are doing all the cooking in an open kitchen at the back of the unadorned 24-seat dining room. (There are eight seats at the bar.) John Parson, the manager, takes care of the beverages. Their food is contemporary, with elements like miso, black garlic, beef tendon and chiles. “The part of Tibet where I’m from is in the east, near Sichuan, so I favor strong flavors,” Mr. Gyamtso said. Mr. Chen said characteristic dishes include oysters with yuzu kosho mignonette, and beef carpaccio with Sichuan seasonings, puffed tendon and coriander. They’ll continue to serve those dishes when they switch from à la carte to a tasting menu format in about six weeks. They’re just waiting for a new sous-chef to arrive from Texas. "
