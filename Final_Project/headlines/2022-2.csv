El Quijote in the Hotel Chelsea Reopens,2022-02-08,article,News,,['Restaurants'],"An all-day restaurant in Penn 1, an East Village outpost for the Bronx Brewery and more restaurant news.","Its signature red neon sign has not changed, nor have the references to Don Quixote, the Spanish tilter of windmills, on its painted walls, frosted glass, ceramics and more. Now,  this restaurant in the Hotel Chelsea on West 23rd Street, one of the city’s oldies — it first opened in 1930 — will open its doors again this week. (It closed in 2018 when the hotel’s renovations began.) The hotel will also reopen this month, but the restaurant is ready now, its size reduced from the original 220 seats to around 65. Sunday Hospitality, the owners of Sunday in Brooklyn, is running it with Charles Seich, a new partner here, and the company’s culinary director and partner, Jaime Young, is in charge of the food. At his side is the chef de cuisine Byron Hogan, who cooked in Spain for the past 12 years, mostly in Madrid, and moved to the United States to work here. “We want to make it authentic, looking more to the north of Spain with the Basque Country and Galicia,” Mr. Young said. Without straying far from the traditional, the chefs have come up with a dish that combines boquerones and oil-cured anchovies, a combination of preserved tuna with leeks and tomato, and squid with morcilla sausage. The paella for which the restaurant has long been known is now made mostly with seafood and also rabbit. The portions are not as massive as in the old days, but that era is evoked by pitchers with red and white sangrias. Spain dominates the wine list, and there are sherries, gins, vermouths and ciders. Burgundy leather, wrought iron, dark wood and a recently uncovered tile floor define the space, with a bar, a few tables and intimate booths. Later this year, Sunday Hospitality will open a French American bistro in the hotel. (Opens Wednesday) "

‘Law & Order’ Is Having an Identity Crisis,2022-02-16,article,News,,['Television'],The franchise has always portrayed the police as flawed but ultimately good.

Detectives are stymied by bureaucrats and squabble with lunkhead patrol officers, who reliably contaminate crime scenes. Idealistic prosecutors grow disillusioned and leave for nonprofit work. And yet the franchise still hinges on a lesser-of-two-evils logic: The institutions may be imperfect, and the cops imperfect, but their vocation is, by definition, good. There are always more victims to avenge, and none better equipped to do it than the New York Police Department."

About a week before, it was a group of young female athletes. The girls kept removing their masks when they talked to one another, and Veronica, who was working the back of the plane near the girls, repeatedly reminded them: “Please put your mask on.” (She and most other attendants asked me not to use their full names, either because an airline’s media policy does not allow them to speak without permission or for fear that doing so might hinder their employment.) “Please put your mask on,” a girl mocked Veronica each time she said it. When the girl got up to go to the bathroom, without a mask, Veronica asked again. The girl, who was about 5-foot-10 and towered over Veronica’s 5-foot-2 frame, said: “I’m so sick and tired of you, bitch. You don’t have authority over me.” They were almost body to body in the cramped area near the lavatory, and Veronica feared the girl was about to hit her, before one of the coaches intervened."

The Best-Seller List Is a Smorgasbord,2022-02-17,article,List,,"['Books and Literature', 'Archaeology and Anthropology', 'Genetics and Heredity']",This week’s latest top sellers include unexpected treats and old favorites.,"ORIGINAL KIN In the vibrant potluck that is the best-seller list, occasionally we find a book that stands out among the usual bowls of chili, trays of baked ziti and platters of Rice Krispie treats. This week the dish that isn’t quite like the others — thriller, mystery, memoir or biography, and so forth — is Jennifer Raff’s “Origin,” which our reviewer described as a “masterly retelling of the story of how, and when, people reached the Americas.” Raff, an anthropological geneticist at the University of Kansas, writes in her introduction, “Looking at the genetic evidence, we will examine the ways in which DNA has challenged and changed our understanding of Native American history, with a special focus on the events that are only indirectly understandable with the archaeological record.” Her approach will be accessible to the pickiest readers, layering personal anecdotes with a visit to a gene-sequencing lab, heavy on compassion and light on jargon. A Goodreads reviewer put it like this about Raff: “As a young mother she can’t help but impart some poignancy in her accounts of those burial sites where toddlers are interred. In doing so she highlights — as she does throughout the book — the humanity of the person whose remains are the subject of research.” “Origin” is Raff’s first book, and it lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8."

With that shift—and the massive and ever-swelling bureaucracy that came with it—the presidency had changed too; what for much of America’s first two centuries had been the office tasked with executing policy and spending money decided and set by Congress had seen that power dynamic reverse and instead now piloted the national agenda itself. It was a job now far too big for one man, even as the White House absorbed, stole, and agglomerated still more power and personnel. To Nixon, figuring out how to staff the oversized presidency—whom to trust, how to inspire them and manage them—consumed far too much energy. “It would be god damn easy to run this office if you didn’t have to deal with people,” he lamented."

Fasano Opens in the Former Four Seasons Space,2022-02-22,article,News,,['Restaurants'],"An all-day offshoot of Patisserie Chanson, a neighborhood bistro for Park Slope, and more restaurant news.","For this new restaurant, the Brazilian architect Isay Weinfeld has not radically disrupted his design for the Four Seasons 2.0, which briefly occupied the space until 2019. He repeated the tawny tones of the wood-paneled main dining room, but now the floor is carpeted, the lighting is softer and wood dividers separate some tables. It is the first New York restaurant for the Fasano Group, a restaurant and hotel powerhouse based in São Paulo, Brazil. (Mr. Weinfeld has designed a number of the group’s many properties.) Gero Fasano, who runs the company in partnership with the developers JHSF, said the new restaurant had to be warmer, more appealing and better for sound. The food is expense-account Northern Italian, mostly traditional and often elaborate, including bollito misto dispensed from a silver cart. The former bar in the front room is now a more informal osteria with linen place mats instead of tablecloths, a huge bar along the windows and a somewhat simpler menu written on smoky mirrors (think spaghetti with tomato sauce and no risotti). The wine selection is global. There is no art on the walls in the dining areas. In late March, outdoor seating will be added, and, upstairs in a few months, there will be a spacious cabaret. Mr. Fasano’s company was founded in 1902 when his Milanese great-grandfather emigrated to Brazil. The family was in and out of the restaurant business over the decades until Mr. Fasano, against the advice of his father who made his fortune in distilleries, plunged in and has applied his exacting standards ever since. The executive chef, Nicola Fedeli, a Florentine who has worked with the company for several years, adheres to Mr. Fasano’s strict demands as to preparation and presentation. There’s no New York-style salad on top of the oversize, impossibly thin $70 veal Milanese; it’s served on the side lest the veal get soggy. (Opens Friday) "
