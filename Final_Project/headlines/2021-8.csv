Today, he’s known for immortalizing the work of the 20th-century architect Horace Gifford with his 2013 book, “Fire Island Modernist,” and for his own reimaginings of midcentury styles and spaces — he recently completed a restoration of a late ’60s Harry Bates-designed home in Fire Island Pines. Moving uptown, says Rawlins, would allow him to reconceptualize his life. “I realized I didn’t have to be a cool kid in the Village and that, if I worked out of my home, I could call the shots professionally,” he says. And so he and his then-partner, the artist Tad Mike, purchased two units in the same 1935 cream brick co-op — a 700-square-foot one-bedroom to live in, and a 1,050-square-foot two-bedroom two floors below to use for their studios — and Rawlins launched his own practice."

With its contoured, soap bar-shaped back and seat, connected by two arcs of molded plywood, it was covered in two-tone Vipla, an Italian marine vinyl.

Now, in collaboration with the Ponti archives, the Italian furniture brand Molteni & C has reimagined the work in ash wood and covered in a variety of textiles and leathers, including this terra-cotta-colored linen. Wearing its covert innovations lightly, and still fashioned from a mere otto pezzi, the chair remains as rigorously insurgent as it is supremely comfortable. Round D.154.5, $5,360, shop.molteni.it."

By the 1920s, the maison was experimenting with exotic Art Deco creations and, in the early ’30s, it pioneered a groundbreaking new technique called the Mystery Set, by which gemstones could be arranged in a mosaiclike pattern without any visible supports. Its sautoirs, minaudières and brooches quickly became favorites among royals and Hollywood stars including Marlene Dietrich, for whom Van Cleef created one of its most iconic designs, the Jarretière bracelet, in 1937. The story goes that Dietrich gave a handful of her gemstone-studded pieces to Louis Arpels, the brother of Estelle and one of the company’s founders, and asked him to create something special. And so the Jarretière was born: The modernist platinum cuff featured an exaggerated, asymmetrical loop covered in cushion-cut rubies set atop twin bucklelike bands of baguette-and-pavé-set white diamonds. (The piece’s name translates to “garter,” and indeed the design resembles the band worn around the top of a woman’s stocking.) Dietrich famously wore it in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1950 noir thriller, “Stage Fright” (she also insisted on head-to-toe Dior for the role), and to the Academy Awards a year later."

Bar Benno Opens in the Former Leonelli Restaurant and Bar Space,2021-08-24,article,News,,"['Restaurants', 'Bars and Nightclubs']","Northern Thai on the Upper East Side, an expansion for a Park Slope, Brooklyn, brew pub, and more restaurant news.","Now that it’s time to begin reopening his restaurants in the Evelyn Hotel in NoMad, the chef Jonathan Benno and his partners decided to do more than simply turn the key. In the space that was Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, they’ve pivoted from Italian to French, with the bar, tables and an open kitchen dedicated to bistro fare, and changed the name to Bar Benno. The elegant flagship Benno, which has three stars from The New York Times, in the back of the space will not change, except to feature more seafood when it’s ready for diners in a month or so. But now, fitted with a huge back bar and a U-shaped counter with seating, the new spot, called Bar Benno, will feature a cold seafood selection, and hors d’oeuvres like escargots, egg in a potato crust, pâté de campagne, and Basque-style tripe on its classic menu. Main courses include rotisserie chicken, steak au poivre and bourride, a rich Provençal seafood stew rarely seen on New York menus. Fries will come alongside steamed mussels, a French dip sandwich and steak tartare. From 5 to 7 p.m., with aperitifs and cocktails, there will be savories like deviled eggs with caviar, salmon rillettes, white anchovies with bread and butter, and fried pig’s trotter with sauce gribiche. “I didn’t feel it was enough just to reopen as we were before,” Mr. Benno said. “I’ve been cooking French most of my whole career, so I’m very comfortable with this. Fortunately, we did not have to do a big renovation.” Mr. Benno also said that it was difficult for Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, an Italian taverna, to establish its own personality. But, he said, offering bistro fare in a space that’s something of a prelude to the Benno dining room and that leans toward France made more sense. A taste of Italy with flatbread pizzas, breads and pastries remains available in Leonelli Bakery in the front of the building. (Opens Friday)"
