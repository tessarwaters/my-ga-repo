"Classical Playlist: Bruckner, Igor Kamenz and More",2014-10-01,article,News,,['Classical Music'],Times critics share what they’ve been listening to lately.,"‘WITOLD MALCUZYNSKI — THE POLISH MASTER PIANIST’(Warner Classics 0 19233 2; eight CDs)It’s impossible to comment thoroughly in this space on an eight-CD set of recordings of the great Polish pianist Witold Malcuzynski. But let this be an alert to all lovers of superb pianism. This is a timely and revealing release. Malcuzynski (1914-77) had trouble escaping the shadow of the older Polish pianist Arthur Rubinstein. Still, he was indeed a master, a probing musician incapable of expressive indulgence, a pianist with a brilliant and admirably unflashy technique. He was best known for his Chopin performances and this set includes waltzes, polonaises, scherzos and the Second Concerto. I am especially captivated by his fleet, no-nonsense account of Rachmaninoff’s Third Concerto, his majestic, granitic playing of Brahms’s First and what has now become one of my favorite recordings of Brahms’s Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Handel. There are works by Liszt, Beethoven, Debussy, Szymanowski and more. (Anthony Tommasini)"

Within Her Sights,2014-10-02,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],The stories in Hilary Mantel’s new collection are designed to frighten readers and make them laugh.,"Reading through Hilary Mantel’s vastly entertaining new collection of stories, I had an experience that, given my day job (literature professor) and age (implacably advancing), hasn’t happened in a while: I ran into an English word I had never seen before. Simple looking, a mere four letters, the word in question appears in “Comma,” the book’s spare and horrifying second tale. Two little girls have clambered over a wall in order to spy on the residents of a mansion known simply as the Hathaways’ house. Mary, a budding juvenile delinquent and the older and bossier of the pair, has told her companion, the 8-year-old narrator, Kitty, that something frightful and mysterious dwells in the house: a pale lumpen creature “wrapped in a blanket,” “something you couldn’t put a name to.” It might be human (“It’s got arms”), but all Mary can say for sure is that it’s awful and shaped like a “comma.” While they hide in the bushes, breathlessly hoping for some glimpse of the creature — it’s a parched midsummer day — Kitty notices “that in the beds of this garden the roses were already scorched into heavy brown blebs on the stalk.”"

The era’s telephone systems required users to connect to a handful of major hubs, which the Soviets would doubtless target in the early hours of World War III. So Baran dreamed up a less vulnerable alternative: a decentralized network that resembled a vast fishnet, with an array of small nodes that were each linked to a few others. These nodes could not only receive signals but also route them along to their neighbors, thereby creating countless possible paths for data to keep flowing should part of the network be destroyed. This data would travel across the structure in tiny chunks, called “packets,” that would self-­assemble into coherent wholes upon reaching their destinations."

In port was the French gunboat La Zélée, without her guns or her crew. La Zélée is a gunboat of 647 tons, entirely unprotected. The two large armored cruisers of 11,600 tons, each armed with eight 210mm. guns, six 150mm. guns and twenty 88mm. guns, heroically sank our little ship at anchor, deprived of all means of attack or defence. To complete this laudable feat, the German cruisers bombarded and half destroyed Papeete. Then they steamed away. All ports in the Pacific being occupied by Anglo-French forces, the career of the Scharnhorst and of the Gneisenau must inevitably soon come to an end, for coaling for them will soon become impossible and they will have to measure themselves against, not a little wooden hull without arms or defenders, but against real warships, the French, British, Japanese and Russian cruisers which are seeking them in the Pacific. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Oct. 4, 1914"

Inside the List,2014-10-03,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Oprah Winfrey has propelled many books onto the best-seller list, but her collection “What I Know for Sure” — No. 6 on the advice and how-to list — is the first best seller that is all her own.","Reading Time: From 1996 to 2011, the most powerful woman in publishing didn’t work in publishing; she worked in TV. I’m talking of course about Oprah Winfrey, whose stamp of approval helped sell tens of millions of books during the 15-year run of her original book club. (She has since introduced a lower-key version she calls Oprah’s Book Club 2.0.) Winfrey’s name is pretty much guaranteed to propel a title onto the list — but she didn’t have a best seller all her own until last month, when her inspirational collection “What I Know for Sure” made its debut at No. 1 on the advice and how-to list, available online. The book, currently No. 6 in its fourth week, gathers Winfrey’s columns for O, The Oprah Magazine, mixing gauzy self-help mantras (“Your spirit,” she writes, “is whispering its greatest desires for you”) with folksy glimpses of her personal life (she grows radishes “so big I call them baboon butts”). She also writes about her love of books. “Everything I do all day, I do in preparation for my reading time,” she says. “Give me a great novel or memoir, some tea and a cozy spot to curl up in, and I’m in heaven. . . . Insight, information, knowledge, inspiration, power: All that and more can come through a good book.”"
Moral of the Story,2014-10-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"A young woman with a past of hardship and suffering makes a new start in Gilead, Iowa.","Regionalism has always played an important part in American literature, with, say, William Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County the iconic Southern example. Those who have read Marilynne Robinson’s radiant Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Gilead,” will remember that imaginary town in southernmost Iowa, near the conjunction of Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska — Plains country, partially Southern in spirit and looking west, thereby broadly embodying the essential rural Midwestern America at a seminal period, from the Depression to around 1950. Although American literature isn’t usually known for its religious and philosophical novels, we might think of certain essential works, particularly of Melville and Hawthorne, that concern grace and redemption. Robinson’s new novel, “Lila,” combines these regional and spiritual strains of American writing. "
Putting Down the Gun,2014-10-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In this memoir, the Times columnist Charles M. Blow describes how he surmounted his rage at childhood mistreatment.","Charles Blow was only 24 when he was asked by The New York Times to direct its graphics department — apparently the youngest department head in the paper’s history. His elegant charts, distillations of political and social complexity, jolted readers with their logic, lucidity and sheer beauty. Before long, he ascended yet again, reinventing himself — and configuring a new genre of journalism — as the paper’s “visual Op-Ed columnist.”"
Viper’s Nest,2014-10-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Auschwitz serves as the backdrop to Martin Amis’s novel of intimacy and moral collapse.,"When Elie Wiesel approached the ­author François Mauriac in the 1950s with a draft of the memoir that would become “Night,” Mauriac was skeptical — not of the book’s quality, but of its necessity. What on earth could “this personal rec­ord, coming as it does after so many others and describing an abomination such as we might have thought no longer had any secrets for us,” have to add to the already vast body of literature about the Holocaust? he wondered. One reads this now with an ironic chuckle. As we approach the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Holocaust, among all its other perverse distinctions, has become the most documented genocide in history. There are memoirs by both survivors and high-ranking Nazis; diaries of life under Nazi rule; collections of letters between SS ­officers and their families; specific investigations of the Nazi doctors, the last few months of the war and the structure of the SS; and multiple biographies of figures major and minor. And that list includes only the books Martin Amis mentions in the afterword to his new novel."
The Elements of Style,2014-10-03,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Women and Girls', 'Fashion and Apparel']","In “Women in Clothes,” more than 600 women respond to a survey about how they present themselves.","Early on a Sunday morning, I passed an elderly woman crossing the street, dressed, arrestingly, for church. She wore a flowing black skirt that fell to her midcalf, and a peach blouse with ample sleeves, a high neck, and a fringe of black ruffle that made a stripe across her chest and arms. The effect was simultaneously cheeky and demure, and its boldness made me wonder: How did she gain this confidence, and how had she retained it? The next thought: How could I be more like her?"

We come to see a player’s outlook, largely a matter of finding suitable opponents, may be changed by the recognition that there is more to life than that.

A Brutal Process,2014-10-03,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Slavery', 'United States Economy']",A historian argues that the slave states were not a world apart but were crucial to American development.,"For residents of the world’s pre-­eminent capitalist nation, American historians have produced remarkably few studies of capitalism in the United States. This situation was exacerbated in the 1970s, when economic history began to migrate from history to economics departments, where it too often became an exercise in scouring the past for numerical data to plug into computerized models of the economy. Recently, however, the history of American capitalism has emerged as a thriving cottage industry. This new work portrays capitalism not as a given (something that “came in the first ships,” as the historian Carl Degler once wrote) but as a system that developed over time, has been constantly evolving and penetrates all aspects of society."
Mortal Coil,2014-10-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Thirteen stories explore the realities of advancing age and vitality on the decline.,"Readers will forgive a book almost anything if it has vitality. That’s why “The Goldfinch” has been so indomitably successful, despite its half-drawn gangsters and its slippage toward melodrama, and that’s why Dickens transcends the mawkishness of Little Nell and John Jarndyce. That’s why Shakespeare’s detractors, from Tolstoy to Ira Glass, always look foolish. The sheer livingness of those writers eclipses their faults."
Dirty Secrets,2014-10-03,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"Archer Mayor’s “Proof Positive” is about the death of a reclusive hoarder, a photojournalist who had suffered a brain injury in Vietnam.","Joe Gunther, one of the most honorable lawmen you’d ever hope to meet, is the designated mourner in Archer Mayor’s rugged regional mysteries. Over the course of some two dozen novels, the former Brattleboro cop, now a senior officer with the Vermont Bureau of Investigation, has borne witness to all the scourges of modern times — from the meth epidemic to freakish acts of nature like Hurricane Irene — that have laid havoc to his home state. But in the background, there have always been glimpses of another painful legacy — the human fallout from the Vietnam War — that now steps out from the shadows in PROOF POSITIVE (Minotaur, $25.99). No one in the village of Dummerston gave much thought to an eccentric hoarder named Benjamin Kendall until a hapless thief burgles his old farmhouse and finds Kendall buried under the towering mounds of detritus. A sad business, but not a case for a major crimes unit like the V.B.I., you’d think; until another body is pulled from the artfully arranged rubble. As it turns out, the reclusive hoarder was a photojournalist who had suffered a brain injury in Vietnam. Thanks to an enterprising art student who arranged for an exhibition of his war photos at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Kendall had finally come to the attention of the art world — and of an enemy who would kill to keep the past buried in the past."

While he was napping, I looked at photos of toddlers with diphtheria and read the accounts of parents who lost teenagers to influenza.

Can Big Data Tell Us What Clinical Trials Don’t?,2014-10-03,article,News,,"['Medicine and Health', 'Research', 'Data-Mining and Database Marketing', 'Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)', 'Statistics', 'Clinical Trials']","To uncover patterns that might steer care, doctors and scientists are dipping into the medical records of thousands of patients.","When a helicopter rushed a 13-year-old girl showing symptoms suggestive of kidney failure to Stanford’s Packard Children’s Hospital, Jennifer Frankovich was the rheumatologist on call. She and a team of other doctors quickly diagnosed lupus, an autoimmune disease. But as they hurried to treat the girl, Frankovich thought that something about the patient’s particular combination of lupus symptoms — kidney problems, inflamed pancreas and blood vessels — rang a bell. In the past, she’d seen lupus patients with these symptoms develop life-threatening blood clots. Her colleagues in other specialties didn’t think there was cause to give the girl anti-clotting drugs, so Frankovich deferred to them. But she retained her suspicions. “I could not forget these cases,” she says."

This year, a Mormon camper decided to drink coffee. Some staff members felt that we should try to stop him, to honor his parents’ wishes (they listed tea and coffee as a dietary restriction). I disagreed; coffee is not dangerous, and I think high-school students are capable of deciding which religious strictures to follow. The camp is legally responsible for students, and we strive to create a safe environment in their families’ stead. But are we ethically bound to enforce their families’ other preferences as well?

I’m not a particular fan of this analogy, for various reasons: Not only because lions-and-catacombs imagery risks trivializing the concept of persecution at a time when Christians outside the United States face actual Diocletian-style consequences for their beliefs (and don’t always receive the charity they deserve from their American co-believers), but also because describing contemporary American culture as pagan in the style of the ancient world strikes me as a category error, which underplays the extent to which middlebrow American spirituality is still infused with Christian-ish sentiments and assumptions and ideas, and underplays, as well, just how radically different a thoroughly repaganized society would be from the one we (happily) inhabit today."

Featuring contributions from members of Belle and Sebastian and Teenage Fanclub and recorded in the studio of Mogwai, it’s a reflection of the close-knit musical community in the Vaselines’s hometown of Glasgow. What’s truly great about the album, however, is the way it captures Kelly and McKee’s mastery at creating shambolic tunes that are equal parts hooks and heartbreak."

"God, Egyptians and Amazons",2014-10-03,article,News,,['Opera'],The 250th anniversary of the death of the composer Jean-Philippe Rameau offers an ideal peg for a new staging of his work in New York.,"Opera Lafayette, the Washington period-instrument group that has gained a strong reputation for its stagings of obscure 18th-century French repertory, needs little additional reason to champion the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau. But the 250th anniversary of his death offers an ideal peg for a new staging of his “Les Fêtes de l’Hymen et de l’Amour, ou Les Dieux d’Égypte” (“The Celebrations of Marriage and Love, or The Gods of Egypt”), which will be performed in New York on Thursday. Rameau’s orchestration and harmony were both revolutionary and controversial. Some 18th-century listeners rejected his musical aesthetic, which was inspired in part by science and philosophy. Dance was also a crucial element for Rameau; Louis de Cahusac, the librettist of this court opera (first performed in 1747) integrated dance into the plot instead of using it merely as a decorative device. Opera Lafayette’s production features three diverse troupes — New York Baroque Dance Company (representing a group of Egyptians); Kalanidhi Dance (as a tribe of Amazons); and the Sean Curran Company (as an irate God and his followers). (7:30 p.m., Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway; operalafayette.org.)"

In “Amélie” (2001), at 10, Audrey Tautou, in her breakthrough role, plays a French sprite working as a waitress who lays out elaborate practical jokes as payback for those who offend her friends. When she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), Amélie finds herself unable to reveal her feelings and instead turns Paris, recreated through sets and computer-generated imagery, into a kind of treasure hunt as she leaves clues about her identity and he trails after her. Writing in The Times, Elvis Mitchell called this comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet whose original title was “Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain,”“a sugar-rush of a movie.” It has, he said, “a hypnotic sense of romance; it’s a fable filled with longing, with a heroine who constantly flirts with failure.” Mr. Mitchell added that there is no denying “that ‘Amélie’ is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous.”"

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this Oscar-nominated documentary, presented here by “POV.” “On the contrary, the way that Anwar and Herman use the fantasy language of genre movies as a tool of stylized, half-earnest confession is what grounds this film’s moral inquiry.” He added: “Some queasiness may linger at the thought of a Western filmmaker indulging the creative whims of mass murderers, exploiting both their guilelessness and the suffering of Indonesians who remain voiceless and invisible here. But this discomfort is an important indicator of just how complicated, how perverse, the cinematic pursuit of truth can be.”"

What’s on TV Tuesday,2014-10-07,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"12:30 P.M. (Sundance) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In this Woody Allen tribute to Italian cinema of the 1950s and ’60s, a retired and overly psychoanalyzed music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to a lawyer (Flavio Parenti). Also in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and falls into the arms of a movie star, while her befuddled husband (Alessandro Tiberi) tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penélope Cruz) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) in shreds when her neurotic actress friend (Ellen Page) visits. Alec Baldwin, above left with Mr. Eisenberg, plays the older architect — a ghost? a specter of the younger man’s self? — who witnesses the ordeal. “One of the most delightful things about ‘To Rome With Love’ is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The movie’s limitations, “as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights.” "

Kicking off this month is the exhibition’s third installment, Prospect.3, during which museums, public parks and galleries dotting scrappy St. Claude Avenue will be transformed into a showcase for nearly 60 artists from around the world. Curated by Franklin Sirmans of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Prospect.3 aims to be a reflection of the city’s singular spirit — a show that mixes the canonized with the newly celebrated (Jean-Michel Basquiat, Camille Henrot, Lucien Smith) to explore ideas about the American South, crime and punishment and the region’s embrace of Mardi Gras culture. “New Orleans is a place where you have this high contrast between the clean and the dirty, the good and the bad, the old and the new, those who have and those who have not,” Sirmans says. “It’s really a microcosm of our whole country.” "

As a result, a critical cocoon has formed around Dunham wherein it’s O.K. to acknowledge her as a feminist icon, but beyond that lies a danger zone — after all, who wants one’s opinions lumped in with the slavishly syco­phantic, the nakedly jealous, the casually misogynistic or the blatantly ageist? Thankfully, Dunham’s “Not That Kind of Girl” offers a reprieve from the hubbub, as it was written not by devotees or detractors but by one woman. "

"Mother of Two, Senator of 20 Million",2014-10-09,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'United States Politics and Government']","Jennifer Senior reviews Kirsten Gillibrand’s memoir, which doubles as a campaign document.","In some ways, the measure of a good political autobiography — which almost invariably is a campaign document masquerading as a reminiscence — boils down to its ratio of originality to bromides. Kirsten Gillibrand’s “Off the Sidelines,” though, is an interesting case, because it ticktocks in perfect 4/4 time between the two, often on the same page, which means one is never quite sure whether to applaud New York’s junior senator for her honesty or toss tomatoes in irritation. There are stretches so platitudinous that it’s almost impossible not to hear blah blah BLAH blah Blaaaaaaaaaaah chiming in one’s head: “I’m a big believer in making your own luck.” Then there are moments of immensely appealing self-disclosure that seldom appear in other books of this genre: “I was a slightly straighter arrow than my mother. O.K., I was a massive kiss-ass and lived for positive reinforcement.” "

1939: Finns Resist Soviet Aggression,2014-10-10,article,News,,['World War II (1939-45)'],Highlights from the International Herald Tribune archives: Finland and Russia are massing troops on their common border in 1939.,"Danger signals flared on a new European front yesterday as Helsingfors stood firm in the face of Soviet moves to extend its Baltic ‘‘protectorate’’ over Finland, and both countries were reported to be massing hundreds of thousands of troops on their common frontier. Finland ignored demands from Moscow that its foreign minister be sent to Russia to conclude an economic and political treaty which would have handed over strategically important islands and ports in both north and south Finland. Instead, the Finnish minister to Sweden, a diplomatic and economic authority, left for Moscow at the head of a mission. The Finns are solidly united in their determination to remain neutral in the present European struggle and to resist aggression. Two hundred thousand Finnish troops are reported massed on the Soviet frontier. Evacuation of numerous towns and villages along the frontier has been ordered, and voluntary civilian evacuation of the capital, Helsingfors, has been asked. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Oct. 11, 1939"

Gwynne, whose “Rebel Yell,” about Stonewall Jackson, is No. 10 on the hardcover nonfiction list, said he was interested in his subject’s transformation from eccentric college professor to Confederate leader.","Blue and Gray and Read All Over: The Civil War ended almost a century and a half ago. But it’s still going strong on the best-seller lists — in 2014 alone, the conflict has appeared on the graphic books list, the hardcover fiction list, the children’s picture books list and the e-books nonfiction list. (One digital best seller, Tim Rowland’s “Strange and Obscure Stories of the Civil War,” features two photo illustrations on the cover: one of a bearded lady with the caption “Sarah Emma Edmonds was a complicated girl,” the other of a battle scene with the caption “Unleashing a maelstrom of fiery hell at a pheasant.” I believe I am warming to e-books.) The latest title to join this march is S. C. Gwynne’s “Rebel Yell: The Violence, Passion, and Redemption of Stonewall Jackson,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. Gwynne — who spent more than a year on the paperback list with his previous book, “Empire of the Summer Moon,” about the Comanche chief Quanah Parker — told The Austin American-Statesman he was especially interested in how Thomas Jackson went, in 14 months, from being an eccentric and unsuccessful college professor to leading the Rebel forces in the Shenandoah Valley campaign. “What fascinates me about Jackson is the idea of transformation,” he said. “He became the most famous man of the war.” Gwynne knows something about personal transformation. In the early 1980s he was working as a banker and dreaming of a writing career when his wife went on the game show “Tic-Tac-Dough” and won $60,000. “That money lasted for years,” he told The American-Statesman. “So I quit banking.”"

Moreover, a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been made by men out of their own needs for their own uses.” If women’s literature were to have a future, she continues, there is a “great part which must be played in that future . . . by physical conditions. The book has somehow to be adapted to the body, and at a venture one would say that women’s books should be shorter, more concentrated, than those of men, and framed so that they do not need long hours of steady and uninterrupted work. For interruptions there will always be.”"

The film comes across as less a portrait of complex intellectuals ideologically embroiled in a conflict than as a weepie about innocents adrift.” Mr. Ejiofor can also be seen as Solomon Northup, a free black man who, in 1841, was kidnapped and sold into slavery, in “12 Years a Slave” (2013), the Oscar winner for best picture, at 11 on HBO2."

It’s a term that means “mountain stronghold,” slang for the breed of counterfeit products stockpiled in lofty, hard-to-access villages: name-brand knockoffs that are famous worldwide for their absurd, sometimes even poetic perversions of Western language."

The stage has an indie-woodsy look for which most Brooklyn coffee-shop owners would sacrifice their flannel and Red Wings.

The exploits of the 350 or so men and women from 13 countries who were with the unit from 1943 to 1951 have been chronicled in books including “The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History,” written by Robert M. Edsel, with Bret Witter, which served as the basis for this film directed by Mr. Clooney, who wrote the screenplay with his producing partner, Grant Heslov. “ 'The Monuments Men’ slices off a sliver of a great World War II story and turns it into a lightweight entertainment that doesn’t ask you to think too hard,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “That’s too bad, because if there’s anyone who you expect to smarten up a joint, it’s Mr. Clooney. The brain trust behind the original Monuments Men was staggering and included individuals who helped run some of America’s greatest cultural institutions. At the very least you expect their fictional counterparts to exchange a little shoptalk and some thoughts on art, literature and the latest restoration techniques or maybe just gossip about Picasso’s latest mistress.”"

It’s her fourth book to become a best seller, which is both heartening and a little weird — heartening because Robinson’s sentences are so polished and faceted and clear they could bend light; weird because most of her books engage deeply with the thornier aspects of Calvinist theology. (“She really is not like any other writer,” Cathleen Schine wrote, approvingly, in The New York Review of Books recently. “She really isn’t.”) Robinson first made the list in 2005 with her second novel, “Gilead,” which went on to win the Pulitzer and spent three months on the hardcover and paperback lists. It also laid the groundwork for both of her subsequent novels, which revisit the same characters and small-town setting. Robinson was as surprised as anyone when “Gilead” found a wide popular audience. “If you were to say to someone that you were to write a book about a minister dying in Iowa in 1956 and that he would spend a certain time on theological reflections, they would not think this was a book that would necessarily . . . sell,” she conceded to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2005. Still, she found the success gratifying. “A Pulitzer Prize is very reassuring,” she told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2008, “and that’s a fact.”"

Next, we look at a pair of celebrities on different ends of the career spectrum: the newly minted megastar actor Channing Tatum, who makes time in his busy schedule to indulge his secret passion, sculpture; and the rock icon Stevie Nicks, who doles out wisdom (and some moon pendants) to the rising girl band Haim at her home in Los Angeles.

We asked the artists (Barbara Kruger, Francesco Vezzoli and others) to get creative in the form of self-promotional advertisements, and the authors (Zadie Smith, James Patterson and others) to pool their talents for a collaborative original story. Elsewhere, Richard Rodriguez pens an essay on what it means to be naked in the digital age; Tim Wu investigates the roots of modern-day mindfulness practices in California wine country; and Gideon Lewis-Kraus travels to the remote Italian island of Stromboli to check out one of art’s oddest — and most volcanic — residencies.

(Syfy) BIRTH (2004) Anna, a young widow played by Nicole Kidman, above, becomes convinced that Sean (Cameron Bright) is the reincarnation of her husband. The trouble is, Sean is only 10. Lauren Bacall plays Anna’s mother in this mystery from Jonathan Glazer; Danny Huston is her frustrated fiancé, and Anne Heche is the sister-in-law with secrets. “The film’s delicate mood of indeterminacy rests on his shoulders, or rather in his smooth, inscrutable face,” A. O. Scott wrote of Mr. Bright in The New York Times. “His character represents a premise that is absurd, even ridiculous, but for ‘Birth’ to work, it must be addressed with utter seriousness, even solemnity. And somehow, in Mr. Glazer’s hands, it does work. The hushed, claustrophobic ambience of high privilege and repressed feeling occasionally cracks, as this horror movie reveals itself also to be a rich, agonizing melodrama and a dry comedy of manners set in a fantasy Manhattan of crème caramel wainscoting and black-tie evenings at the opera.” Of Ms. Kidman, he added, “she gives herself so completely to the role that the film becomes both spellbinding and heartbreaking, a delicate chamber piece with the large, troubled heart of an opera.” "

Into the Woods,2014-10-22,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Neil Gaiman and Lorenzo Mattotti reinvent “Hansel and Gretel.”,"Written with a devastating spareness by Neil Gaiman and fearsomely illustrated in shades of black by Lorenzo Mattotti, the newest version of “Hansel and Gretel” astonishes from start to finish. It doesn’t hurt that the book itself is a gorgeous and carefully made object, with a black floral motif on its pages’ decorated borders, along with abundant red drop caps and tall, round gray page numbers. (Published by Toon Books, the New Yorker art director Françoise Mouly’s venture into richly illustrated books for children, it comes in two formats, with an oversize one that includes an afterword about the evolution of the tale.) All the well-chosen detail provides an ideal backdrop for what Gaiman and Mattotti have done with the Grimm Brothers’ familiar story of the two siblings who, after being abandoned by desperate parents, outwit their witchy captor. Their rendition brings a freshness and even a feeling of majesty to the little tale. Some great, roiling essence of the human condition — our fate of shuttling between the darkness and the light — seems to inhabit its pages."

What’s on TV Thursday,2014-10-23,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9:55 A.M. (Starz) THE LUNCHBOX (2014) When a delivery service sends the lunch intended for her husband astray, a neglected Mumbai housewife (Nimrat Kaur) finds herself communicating through handwritten letters and home-cooked meals with a widowed office worker (Irrfan Khan) nearing retirement in Ritesh Batra’s debut feature. “This is not a new conceit,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, citing “You’ve Got Mail” and “The Shop Around the Corner.” “But the idea of two lonely souls connecting in a vast, modern metropolis, and remaining strangers even as their intimacy grows, has a durable charm. As do Mr. Khan and Ms. Kaur, islands of melancholy calm surrounded by silliness and noise. Their performances are not exactly subtle — nothing in ‘The Lunchbox’ is exactly subtle — but they are graceful and dignified in the manner of movie stars in an earlier, less aggressive age, ennobling the ordinary lives they explore. And Mr. Batra makes their story touching and credible, an urban fable of hope in the face of disappointment.”"

She read it on a foggy night, in a “very creepy suburban town full of people who seemed nice but could have been into child sacrifice; hard to say. I never looked at a supermarket the same way after that story. Or a pharmacy. (Oh, my God, the pharmacy.)”"

He doesn’t say, but he claims there’s a whole genre of “apparently true” mobile phone ghost stories, including “texts from the dead.” There are even haunted spell-checks. When the name “Prudentia” was highlighted on a document during a 1998 investigation in Britain, the alternative spellings that reportedly came up were “dead,” “buried” and “cellar.” We’re not told if investigators dug up the cellar, and if they did, whether they found Prudentia."
Jean Thompson’s ‘The Witch: And Other Tales Re-told’,2014-10-24,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Fairy Tales']",Folk and fairy tales are loosely reimagined and rendered with scrupulous realism.,"The practice of retelling fairy tales in the form of literary fiction is, if not quite hallowed, certainly established. The great Angela Carter’s revelatory 1979 story collection, “The Bloody Chamber” — a brocaded work of heady sensuality, intelligence and violence — remains the benchmark, but Kate Bernheimer’s Fairy Tale Review and the several excellent Bernheimer-edited anthologies spun off from it carry the standard forward. Those are just some of the more overt homages; Western literature owes as much to fairy tales as it does to Greek myth and the Bible. In the right light, “Pride and Prejudice” is a retelling of “Beauty and the Beast.”"

In the summer of 1816, Lord Byron; his doctor, John Polidori; the poet Percy ­Bysshe Shelley; and Shelley’s lover, Mary Godwin, did just that, hatching, with improbable coincidence, “Frankenstein” and “The Vampyre,” the slender precursor to Bram Sto­ker’s “Dracula.” Andrew McConnell Stott’s “The Poet and the Vampyre” examines the fateful gathering’s personalities, promise and perils."

In “The Immortal Evening” (the phrase is from Haydon’s letters and diaries), the poet and biographer Stanley Plumly offers an idiosyncratic, heartfelt, at once sinuous and expansive exploration of the dinner, its “aesthetic context and the larger worlds of the individual guests, particularly the three ‘immortal’ writers, Keats, ­Wordsworth and Lamb.”"

Bill Cunningham | Paying Respects,2014-10-25,article,News,,"['Funerals and Memorials', 'Fashion and Apparel']",Is there an appropriate code of dress for memorial services today?,"Is there an appropriate code of dress for memorial services today? On Saturday, Oct. 18, a group of very elegant people entered St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue. It turned out to be a memorial service for Eileen Ford, a founder of the modeling agency named for her, who died in July. The spectacle of the nearly 500 decorously dressed people at the memorial service was in sharp contrast to the mixed-up looks of today’s fashion, even at funerals. For some, a dash of mauve, red or white on black, or a spectrum of grays was an appropriate approach. The clothes reflected what Mrs. Ford brought to the industry, which was a sense of decorum. On Monday, farther up Fifth Avenue, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held a preview of its elegant small exhibition “Death Becomes Her: A Century of Mourning Attire,” with all the rigid rules of 19th-century mourning dress. And after the announcement of Oscar de la Renta’s death Monday evening, at benefit dinners during the week some women wore their own Oscars in honor of the designer, bottom center. While the late 20th century threw most of the rules out the window, black remains dominant. One casualty of changes in funeral style was the hat, once required."

What’s on TV Saturday,2014-10-25,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"7 P.M. (HBO Signature) THE CONJURING (2013) Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play Ed and Lorraine Warren, the real-life paranormal investigators who declared an infamous Dutch colonial-style house on Long Island haunted, leading to the many “Amityville” movies. Their target this time is a Rhode Island farmhouse, where the blissful dreams of Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Tayor and Ron Livingston, above, with Mr. Wilson, right) and their five daughters become a moaning, creaking nightmare when they find themselves playing cat-and-mouse with an evil force. The director, James Wan, “smartly keeps enough distance from the Warrens that you can see that these true believers are also hovering at the edge of dangerous fanaticism,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “That gives the movie a shiver of political currency, even if a greater, more sustaining pleasure of this particular haunted-house fantasy is how it works as a metaphor for moviegoing itself. When the Perrons first settle into their house, they’re facing the future with bright, anxious smiles that aren’t much different from those of the horror-film faithful who are waiting nervously, hopefully, to be jolted by the next great shocker. It’s here.” "

In this thriller directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, Julianne Moore, Corey Stoll, Michelle Dockery, Scoot McNairy, Lupita Nyong’o, Linus Roache and Shea Whigham add to the suspense in their roles as prospective heroes or villains. And while the movie doesn’t always make sense, that’s “incidental to the pleasures of a slow-season Liam Neeson release as diverting as this one,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “A lot has been written about Mr. Neeson’s surprising resurrection as an older action hero, which has sometimes been more rewarding theoretically than cinematically. Mr. Collet-Serra, however, makes good on that promise with a sure genre hand and real feeling for what Mr. Neeson brings to the screen at this stage of his career, including beauty etched by time and a still-imposing body that moves with the heaviness and grandeur of an old warrior raising his sword one last time. When Mr. Neeson runs through the aisles, he can sometimes seem too big for this vehicle, even if he turns out to be exactly right.”"

The company, which is based in Los Angeles (“a city that has always been a frontier for new explorations,” Sharon notes), has commissioned and produced three operas to date, all of which have been site-specific enterprises that reimagine the roles of both the performers and the audience. “Invisible Cities,” based on Italo Calvino’s postmodern book of the same name, has received the most acclaim; its composer, Christopher Cerrone, was a finalist for a 2014 Pulitzer Prize."

No matter how bad your life is, no matter how legitimate your reasons for being upset, they say, ‘Don’t worry, be happy.’ Song’s only three minutes, then you stop being happy. The way they control human beings, like cattle. How do a sheepdog keep 50 or 100 sheeps in order? I’m watching a dog keep a herd on TV, and I’m thinking that’s the way the system got most human beings: ‘Eat this. Drink that.’ ”"

Soon dozens were raining down from the sky at once, and, not being the most agile fliers, they tumbled into our hair and bounced down the backs of our necks. Within a few short minutes, as many as 50,000 dung beetles landed, all racing to carve out a meal for themselves and their young."

He and his cronies were taken to Munich’s Stadelheim prison, where they were shot on the spot — except for Röhm, whose execution occurred shortly thereafter. Similar raids took place that night against other SA leaders, who were charged, like Röhm, with having planned a coup against Hitler and his government. In reality, this “Night of the Long Knives” was the violent end to power struggles between Hitler and the army officer corps on the one hand, and Röhm, as the head of roughly two million paramilitary storm troopers, on the other. They had challenged Hitler’s absolute leadership and also the professional officer corps’s claim to be the sole bearer of arms in Nazi Germany."

"‘The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science,’ by Armand Marie Leroi",2014-10-31,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Science and Technology']",Recovering Aristotle as a scientist who explored and cataloged the Mediterranean’s natural world.,"Armand Marie Leroi is a scientist, and Aristotle is his hero. This conjunction is interesting because, in the official telling of modern science’s origins, Aristotle is hardly regarded as heroic. Instead he’s portrayed as the obstacle over which the early heroes of the scientific revolution — Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo — had to leap in order to impose a genuinely explanatory methodology over the often deceptive input of sense perception. After all, what could be clearer to the senses than that the Earth is stationary and the heavens revolve around it? If there was any ancient whom these pioneers of modern science esteemed it was Plato. He, too, had emphasized the deceptiveness of appearances. What’s more he had suggested, however obliquely, most especially in his “Timaeus,” that mathematics reveals the true structure of the cosmos, offering us the means by which we can distinguish between reliable and unreliable appearances. So, at least, did men like Galileo read the “Timaeus,” finding insights there to topple the formidable edifice of a Church-fortified Aristotelianism. The new scientists discarded at least two of the four Aristotelian causes, the formal and the final, the latter having injected a pernicious teleology into all physical explanations. (Flames leap and rocks fall because their constituent elements are striving to get to their right places.) In place of Aristotle’s qualitative categories, the new scientists put quantitative descriptions of matter in motion. What Aristotle had sundered, the celestial and the terrestrial, were united under one mechanics. And the rest, as they say, is history."

As Stevenson told Jon Stewart during a recent appearance on “The Daily Show,” one story in the book involves a man wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to death before Stevenson took him on as a client. “The case that I talk about was out of Monroeville, Ala.,” he said. “Monroeville is the community where Harper Lee grew up and wrote ‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’ And if you go to people there, they love that story. And they love celebrating that story. But we have an innocent African-American man being sent to death row for a crime he didn’t commit, and there’s no consciousness about that. . . . One of the most powerful things for me in this book was trying to get people to appreciate that we have a criminal justice system that treats you better if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent. I’m not trying to beat up on people who are wealthy, but I want us to understand if we’re really committed to justice, we’ve got to do better for the poor than we’re doing.

The Rohilla had on board a staff of doctors and nurses who had just set out on their errand of mercy, together with a large crew. The seas were so heavy that the ship’s boats were smashed immediately after being lowered. Some persons aboard were rescued by lifeboats but eighty are still on the wreck, according to the latest news received to-day, enormous seas preventing their rescue. Several bodies have been washed ashore.

Now late at night the middle of the vessel is the only portion remaining, the stem and stern having both parted. Those crowded in the dismembered portion appear to be doomed, for, so far as can be seen, no human aid can be extended to them.’’ — The New York Herald, European Edition, Nov. 1, 1914"

Great Escapism,2014-10-31,article,News,,['Travel and Vacations'],"A stay at a nice hotel can give us a brief opportunity to escape our regular lives, to be someone else and to return home refreshed. So, we hope, can a magazine.","For this travel issue, we could have offered you specific suggestions of places to visit, meals to eat, sights not to miss. Instead, we decided to focus on the pleasures of various kinds of travel and the meanings of different destinations. The hope is that you will be transported by these ideas and images, whether or not you plan on making any of the journeys our writers undertook — going, for instance, from London to Venice aboard the luxurious Orient Express. A pair of mystery author friends realize that the train’s original luxury, speed, has been replaced by the more contemporary luxury of time. (It takes two days to cover what would be a two-hour flight.) Those days are spent in close quarters with strangers, liveried staff and the authors’ own imaginations. More energetically, our critic at large Jody Rosen heads to Bhutan, a country where the royal family’s passion for bicycling might just rival Buddhism as the path to nirvana. Perhaps it’s no surprise that the place that engendered the concept of Gross National Happiness should also endorse a more scenic, wind-in-your-face form of getting from A to B. Closer to home — or at least to the home of the photographer Bruce Weber — a shack on the beach provides the fantasylike backdrop to a fashion shoot that evokes the freedom and beauty of youth, as captured by the teenagers Jean Campbell, a new model, and Brooklyn Beckham, child of David and Victoria. The pictures conjure a sense of the carefree idealism in those long summer days between childhood and adulthood, which — however far away those things might seem — we ought not to lose if we can help it. It is some aspect of that feeling we seek to capture in any vacation by the sea."
