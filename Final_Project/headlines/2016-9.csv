How to Tickle Someone,2016-09-01,article,News,,['Tickling'],Be unpredictable. Keep things consensual.,"“Stop, start again, be surprising,” says Marina Davila-Ross, a professor at Britain’s University of Portsmouth who studies laughter and play. Unpredictability is the key element of tickling, which is why you cannot tickle yourself. Brains are prediction machines; if your own hand reaches in for a tickle, your brain will foresee and cancel out the results. (Research shows that some schizophrenics are able to tickle themselves because they don’t make the same distinctions between self and other.) Davila-Ross has tickled humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and gorillas, and she says sometimes just the pretouch anticipation evokes laughter. Only the great apes regularly tickle one another, although many animals, including rats, cats and dogs, enjoy it. (In one study, rats kept in social isolation and exposed to regular electrical shocks exhibited less fear and lower catecholamine stress hormones when tickled daily by a researcher.)"

1891: Fraud at the Bank of England,2016-09-02,article,News,,['Frauds and Swindling'],From the archives of The International Herald Tribune: The Bank of England suffers fraud in September 1891.,"For some days persistent rumors have been in the air of a colossal fraud said to have been perpetrated on the Bank of England. On Monday the amount alleged to have been stolen was currently given as £250,000, and since then the sum has advanced by leaps and bounds, until today it was confidently asserted in the City that it amounted to half a million. These rumors have obtained a degree of credence in banking circles which calls for authoritative treatment. There is no truth whatever in the report, which, if well founded, would have startled the commercial world, and must have produced results disastrous to the largest interests. The Governor of the Bank of England states that there is absolutely no foundation for the rumors. The story, it appears, arose as follows: It will be remembered that in February last a counter robbery was effected at the Bank of Scotland. Certain of the securities then stolen have been within the last few days presented for payment in Paris, and in one of the Paris papers an announcement appeared confusing the Bank of Scotland with the Bank of England, and stating the amount of the frauds to have been £250,000. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 3, 1891 "

Inside the List,2016-09-02,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"Elizabeth Letts’s “The Perfect Horse,” No.17 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list, is about a breed of horses abducted by the Nazis.","Saddle Up: As any observer of the best-seller lists can tell you, World War II exerts a deep hold on the popular imagination. Lately, though, readers seem less interested in the Nazis’ human victims than in the quirky corners of the war. A couple of years ago, Robert M. Edsel (and his co-writer, Bret Witter) spent 21 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list with “The Monuments Men,” about Allied efforts to retrieve looted art from the Germans; now Elizabeth Letts’s “The Perfect Horse” — No. 17 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list — tells a similar story about the mission to save a breed of horses, the noble Lipizzaner stallions, that the Nazis abducted to create a “master race” of war animals. General Patton himself approved the rescue: “Get them. Make it fast,” the book quotes him saying. But why divert military resources to protect horses, however mighty? According to an essay Letts wrote for the ­Amazon blog Omnivoracious, the answer lies with the Army’s legacy of training cavalry officers. “Turns out, the interwar years are called the cavalry’s golden age,” she says. “Army-bred horses won Olympic medals and Army-trained riders shone in international competitions. To belong to the U.S. Cavalry was to be a skilled rider. It was also to be trained in a code of honor known to cavalries around the world: Always take care of your horse first. In the last days of World War II, the world’s most priceless purebreds were in danger of being slaughtered for food. Their only hope was a group of American soldiers who by chance were camped out nearby. As it happened, these were the soldiers of the Second Cavalry — one of America’s most storied mounted units, and one of the last to be mechanized. . . . As Patton liked to remind people, many of the most celebrated leaders in World War II got their start as cavalry officers, and in the last days of the war, when the priceless purebreds were in danger, these men remembered the lesson to put the horses first.” Letts is, no surprise, a horse lover herself: Her previous best seller, “The Eighty-Dollar Champion,” was about the show jumper Snowman, and in her Twitter biography she admits she “never got over Black Beauty.”"

I have always felt that his images were so artfully designed, produced and in many cases made statements that went far beyond anything he was thinking about in the short period of time he had to get an image done for a client.” Displayed for the first time in a gallery setting, the large archive has been beautifully brought back to life after many decades in the dark. The crispness and tonality of Gary’s work in the exhibition marks it as belonging to another, much simpler era of photography — but there’s a freshness and nostalgia to the images that register as current and purposeful."

If any story could be said to benefit from meat-and-potatoes artlessness, it’s Escobar’s."

Over the past half-century, after all, Wolfe’s own work has contributed mightily to the evolution of a certain kind of language — or the evolution of a style, anyway: the neon-lit, whiz-bang exploding cigar of a sentence, bristling with exclamation points and packed tighter than a spring-loaded snake in a can of peanuts. As a founder of New Journalism in the 1960s and the author of sprawling social novels beginning with “The Bonfire of the Vanities,” in 1987, Wolfe has cast a big shadow on generations of American writers. But it turns out mere influence isn’t what he has in mind with “The Kingdom of Speech,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 14. Instead, Wolfe trains his sights on biological evolution — specifically, Darwin’s theory of natural selection — and what he sees as its inadequacy to account for the existence of human language. Along the way, he also attacks the neo-Darwinian linguist Noam Chomsky, who has advanced the idea of language as an innate evolutionary trait."

Last year, approximately 884 million people — more than twice the population of the U.S. — visited Ikea stores.

So it made sense that the makeup look at his spring/summer 2017 show took an artist-driven approach. Backstage, the makeup artist Francelle Daly slicked on graphic eyeliner, then removed the edges for a conceptual play on negative space. “It’s about modernizing the way we wear eyeliner,” she explained of her technique — which stood out for not only its impactful quality, but also for its ease of application. Daly simply outlined the eyes, “saturating” the upper and lower lash lines in Nars Eyeliner Stylo in Carpates, then traced Nars Kohliner Minorque along the inner waterline. Then, for the fun part: Daly dipped her Q-tip in a water cleanser and “chopped” off the inner and outer corners of her lines, customizing the shape to each models’ eyes. “Maybe it’s a little smaller at the bottom, maybe it’s a little bigger on top, just to make sure you don’t overpower the eye, or look like a raccoon,” she noted. Daly also recommends stepping back and looking in the mirror to ensure your liner is somewhat symmetrical on both eyes. But don’t agonize over it: “It’s all about what works best for you when doing your makeup, and being your own artist.”"

Two Cookbooks Offer Fresh Approaches for Rosh Hashana,2016-09-19,article,News,,"['Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Jews and Judaism', 'Rosh Hashana']",“The Gefilte Manifesto” and “Le Marais” go well beyond the usual brisket or roast chicken.,"Sometimes all it takes is one recipe to justify a new cookbook. The chicken soup in “The Gefilte Manifesto” uses chicken parts that you brown before making the soup, something I have never done. But it works, enhancing depth and color in the broth. The whole point of the book, by the founders of the Gefilteria, the inventive online Jewish food company and caterer, is reworking traditional kosher Ashkenazi cooking and preparing dishes from scratch, with recipes like an inspired kimchi-stuffed cabbage. There’s even a recipe for kosher kimchi. But the so-called apple strudel, while easy and tasty, is a deep-dish pie, not a strudel at all. Another new approach to your Rosh Hashana dinner (the observance starts the evening of Oct. 2) may come from the kosher New York steakhouse Le Marais. Consider recipes for duck cassoulet, coq au vin, slow-roasted lamb shoulder or veal braciole from this new book instead of the usual brisket or roast chicken. The chef, Mark Hennessey, explains various steak cuts and how he adapts French recipes so they conform to the kashrut: “The Gefilte Manifesto: New Recipes for Old World Jewish Foods,” by Jeffrey Yoskowitz and Liz Alpern (Flatiron Books, $35), and “Le Marais: A Rare Steakhouse … Well Done,” by Mark Hennessey and Jose Meirelles (Gefen Publishing, $29.95)."

Curtis Hanson: A Filmmaker of Sunshine and Noir,2016-09-22,article,An Appraisal,,['Movies'],"The director of “L.A.

Those of us who travel professionally, with a view to record for those at home our encounters on the road, try to bridge that perceptual divide. This can be uncomfortable. Tourists in bad faith, we are paid to elevate our naïve consumption (of city, museum, vista, ruin, breakfast) to the level of a vocation.

The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,2016-09-23,article,News,,['Books and Literature'],"“The Hidden Life of Trees,” No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list, describes the way trees protect their young, communicate and develop communities.","Timber: “I speak for the trees,” the Lorax proclaimed. But maybe trees can speak for themselves, if we’d just shut up and listen. That’s the premise of a book by the German forest ranger Peter Wohlleben, “The Hidden Life of Trees,” that debuts at No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list and explains — in strikingly anthropomorphic terms — how trees protect their young, communicate through underground networks and develop sophisticated social communities, among other things. “When trees are really thirsty, they begin to scream,” Wohlleben writes. “If you’re out in the forest, you won’t be able to hear them, because this all takes place at ultrasonic levels.” Published last year in Germany, the book has already been a big best seller there, prompting a New York Times profile of the author last winter. (My favorite quote came not from Wohlleben — who once clarified to a German newspaper that “I don’t hug trees and I don’t talk to them” — but from a German literary critic eager to dismiss the idea that forestry was a particularly German obsession: “Yes, there’s ‘Hansel and Gretel,’ and, sure, if your marriage fails, you go for a long hike in the woods. But I don’t think Germans love their forest more than Swedes or Norwegians or Finns.”) Now that Wohlleben’s book has been translated into English, by Jane Billinghurst, other media outlets are also taking notice. “The thing that surprised me most is how social trees are,” Wohlleben told The Guardian recently. “I stumbled over an old stump one day and saw that it was still living although it was 400 or 500 years old, without any green leaf.

This extrasolar planet, or “exoplanet,” appeared to be a Jupiter-like ball of gas and liquid with a blistering atmospheric temperature of 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit. In the two decades since, astronomers have detected more than 3,000 exoplanets. No one has yet found a replica of Earth, although Proxima b, an Earth-size planet in a temperate orbit a mere 4.2 light-years away, whose discovery was announced last month, sounds as if it could be a decent place to live."

T’s New Design & Luxury Issue: Editor’s Letter,2016-09-23,article,News,,[],"For this issue, we decided to take a closer look at the meaning of design and why we make certain choices.","Design is so pervasive, argues Michael Rock in his Sign of the Times essay, that it often appears as fact rather than the result of subjective decision-making. After a period of time, an idea that originally evolved from mores, habits or customs becomes so codified and ingrained that it takes on the air of inevitability. For this issue, we decided to take a closer look at the meaning of design and why we make certain choices, from the wild natural beauty of Isabel and Julian Bannerman’s garden to the fine attention to detail in the rising designer Billy Cotton’s interiors. We considered the psychological effects of design, from the standpoint of a mad collector, the young fashion designer Jonathan Anderson, to what happens when it all goes terribly wrong. Of course, we also celebrate the vast range of the designed world: teapots, interesting hairdos, clever companies, artists’ communities, fabric, paint and rugs, jewels, clothing, even plumbing. Added up, these stories are a call to see design more clearly, to appreciate what is all around us, but also to realize the delicacy of ingenuity — that none of it had to be quite this way, and yet it is. And, to recognize that if something isn’t working, we can try to design its change."
