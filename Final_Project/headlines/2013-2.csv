The opposition leader, Sheik Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib, said many critics had not fully read the explanations he had posted Wednesday on his Facebook page.

But the offer to start talks broke a longstanding opposition demand: no talks until Mr. Assad steps down. Sheik Khatib said in his Facebook posting that he would be willing to talk with Mr. Assad’s representatives in Egypt, Tunisia or Turkey, all of which support the Syrian opposition. He also demanded other preconditions, including the release of 160,000 prisoners in Syria. “Nobody has said it is going to be easy,” Mr. Brahimi said. “But perhaps negotiating is better than killing each other.” "

Uglow issued her ambitious “International Dictionary of Women’s Biography,” aiming to satisfy “a desire to look at women’s strength in action, rather than (as is so often done) to lament their oppression as passive victims,” the 19th-­century Cumbrian architect Sarah Losh, with little more than a country church, a schoolhouse and a sexton’s cottage to her credit, didn’t make the cut. Nor did Losh answer Uglow’s “request for heroines” by the time a third edition of the dictionary appeared, published in the United States in 1999 as “The Northeastern Dictionary of Women’s Biography.” There, if she’d qualified, Losh would have shared a page with the “American feminist poet” Audre Lorde, the “Italian actress” Sophia Loren, the “Spanish soprano” Victoria de los Angeles and the “English trade unionist” Dame Anne Loughlin.

Here was a book that was funny, smart, playful, the feminine present and unapologetically intellectual and erotic. But, finally, impressive as it was, that first collection didn’t do for me what Dickinson claimed great poetry should — make me feel that the top of my head was taken off. In bold and moving contrast, Shaughnessy’s emotionally charged and gorgeously composed third volume of poems, “Our Andromeda,” moves me line by line and poem by poem so that by the book’s final, monumental title poem, I am top-of-the-head-blown-off undone. In “Our Andromeda” Shaughnessy has brought to bear her inevitable syntactic and sonic hula-hooping, her playful and ironic uses of form, her vivid mind on poems that absolutely matter."

What’s on Monday,2013-02-04,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) MEA MAXIMA CULPA: SILENCE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD (2012) Alex Gibney documents the case of the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy, above, a Roman Catholic priest in Wisconsin who died in 1998 after having molested dozens if not hundreds of children in his care at a boarding school for the deaf, resulting in a trail of denial and cover-up from rural America to the Vatican. Mr. Gibney’s “methods are a blend of solid journalism and cinematic sensationalism,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The reliance on melodramatic music and lurid — though not explicit — re-enactments does not seem to me to make the movie more powerful, but rather the opposite. There is something to be said for a clear and unblinking recitation of facts, and thankfully Mr. Gibney does a lot of that.” But the heart of the film, “the real source of its emotional impact,” Mr. Scott said, “lies in a remarkable series of interviews with some of the men, most now in their 60s, who endured Father Murphy’s assaults when they were children and who have worked for almost 40 years to bring his crimes to light.” John Slattery, Jamey Sheridan, Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke interpret their words.

Now Bidding | The ‘Watchmen’ Covers,2013-02-06,article,News,,['Comic Books and Strips'],Comic book fans with deep pockets will have a chance to own a piece of “Watchmen” when covers of the inaugural issues are sold at Heritage Auctions this month.,"Comic book fans with deep pockets will have a chance to own a piece of “Watchmen” when the covers of the first three issues are sold at Heritage Auctions this month, in a sale that ends on Feb. 22; issue No. 1 alone is expected to bring in more than $100,000. (Three additional auctions will follow in May, August and November, each featuring three covers from the original 12-issue series published by DC Comics.) Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, “Watchmen” ushered in a new level of mature storytelling with adult themes and flawed heroes. Gibbons sold the covers and original artwork to “Watchmen” — “pitifully cheap,” he noted — nearly as quickly  as he created it, fearing that there would be no takers. “It seemed like a good idea to me at the time,” he said. “In my experience, the sort of comic art that sold well were kind of money shots — big action shots of the heroes in costumes doing something interesting. I realized that ‘Watchmen’ was filled with a lot of meat and potatoes stuff, people standing around talking, which I didn’t think would be as popular.” The series went on to become a perennial best seller. It was adapted into a live action film that was released in 2009 and, last year, DC began publishing a series of prequels called “Before Watchmen,” which caused some consternation with fans and creators who felt that “Watchmen” should stand alone."

What’s On Thursday,2013-02-07,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"1:30 P.M. (MoreMax) THE DESCENDANTS (2011) Matt King (George Clooney, in an Oscar-nominated role), a real estate lawyer whose family tree includes the earliest white settlers in Hawaii as well as indigenous royalty, struggles to make the right decision regarding his family’s birthright: a pristine and picturesque tract on Kauai. Should it be sold to developers? In the meantime his wife, Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), is in a coma in a Honolulu hospital after a boating accident. Not long after her doctors inform Matt that he is about to become a widower and a single father to two difficult daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley), he learns that Elizabeth was having an affair. Robert Forster portrays Elizabeth’s enraged father, who blames his daughter’s condition on Matt’s tightwad ways; Matthew Lillard plays Brian, the object of Elizabeth’s affection; Judy Greer is Brian’s wife; Nick Krause (above, with, from left, Mr. Clooney, Ms. Miller and Ms. Woodley) is Alex’s goofy sidekick; and Beau Bridges is Matt’s cousin. Mr. Clooney’s actorly instincts “have never been keener or more generous,” and Ms. Woodley gives “one of the toughest, smartest, most credible adolescent performances in recent memory,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this drama directed by Alexander Payne and based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. He added: “Mr. Payne, with a light touch and a keen sense of place — this Hawaii is as real and peculiar as the Nebraska of ‘About Schmidt’ or the California wine country of ‘Sideways’ — has made a movie that, for all its modesty, is as big as life. Its heart is occupied by grief, pain and the haunting silence of Elizabeth, whose version of events is the only one we never hear. And yet it is also full of warmth, humor and the kind of grace that can result from our clumsy attempts to make things better.” "

And now it appears to have set a record for the speed at which it has inspired a hip-hop tribute: “I Can’t Stop Watching House of Cards” is the creation of Adam WarRock (the nom de rap of Eugene Ahn) and it has already earned an endorsement of sorts from the “House of Cards” show runner, Beau Willimon. For the uninitiated, the video won’t spoil any crucial “House of Cards” plot points, though it will give you a thorough introduction to the series star Kevin Spacey’s fluctuating Southern accent. "

A lovely rack of lamb with lush potatoes would do it justice. Or consider denting the budget a bit more with a foie gras and truffle indulgence for two. By using either tinned or fresh preserved foie gras, as in a mousse with truffles or a nice portion of foie gras au torchon, you can dress some pappardelle or tagliatelle in deep velvet and create a dish that seeks the acidity and sleek fruit of these wines. As for the truffle, fresh black is not required. A less costly tinned or jarred truffle provides juice to enhance the sauce. Both the foie gras and truffle can be found at a fancy food shop or online. And beyond Valentine’s Day, the recipe makes a fine special-occasion first course or midcourse to serve four pampered guests.  FLORENCE FABRICANT"

There’s a striking moment in the closing pages of his new book, “How Literature Saved My Life,” when he tells us that he is interested only in literature that obliterates the boundary between life and art. “Acutely aware of our mortal condition,” he writes, “I find books that simply allow us to escape existence a staggering waste of time (literature matters so much to me I can hardly stand it).” If there were such a thing as a quintessentially Shields­ian pronouncement, this may be it, with its odd tonal mixture of the bombastic and the beseeching. Shields wants you to know that he is a writer for whom neither life nor art is a matter to be taken lightly."

War Machines,2013-02-08,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'World War II (1939-45)']",A new history of the tactics and technological innovations that secured an Allied victory in World War II.,"The historian Daniel Boorstin once complained to me about the Smithsonian Institution’s decision in 1980 to delete the final two words from the name of its Museum of History and Technology. Boorstin had a point. Scholars of other fields do often tend to underestimate the influence of technology. Although most of us know that World War II brought us radar, the literature of that titanic conflict is by no means exempt from this phenomenon. For instance, the biographer Joseph P. Lash subtitled his 1976 wartime account of Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill “The Partnership That Saved the West,” in response to which I once heard a British scholar carp, “If Lash is right, then why did all those scientists and intelligence officers and factory workers bother working so hard?”"
Avoiding Defeat,2013-02-08,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'United States Defense and Military Forces', 'Iraq War (2003-11)', 'Afghanistan War (2001- )']",Did gifted generals really save the day for the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan?,"Two graphs introduce the text of “The Endgame,” Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor’s instructive yet analytically shallow account of the Iraq war after the fall of Baghdad. The first depicts weekly attacks in Iraq from early 2004 to mid-2010, the second civilian deaths from January 2006 to May 2010. The graphs present identical images: bad news getting worse until early 2007, then pronounced improvement. The message is clear: In early 2007 a decided turn occurred. As with the Civil War after Gettysburg or the war in the Pacific after Midway, a conflict that had been going badly suddenly started heading in the right ­direction."

See for Yourself,2013-02-08,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Creatures big and small (and metallic) venture beyond their cozy confines to explore exciting places and make new friends.,"When it comes to picking children’s books, I am a lot like those old ladies you see in Upper West Side supermarkets, tapping, squeezing and smelling the melons on display: “Is it ripe, dear?” Bringing a children’s book into your home is not something to take lightly. An obliging parent may be asked to read it a hundred times. Nay, a thousand times. The big-eyed sheep that seemed so cute while you were flipping through pages in the store soon begins to vex. Over time, reading the book becomes like ripping off a Band-Aid. Even small defects — an irritating drawing, the misuse of the word “presently,” a character who speaks in rhyme — can form blisters on the parental soul. No, darling, not again. Let’s pick another book, please. I’ve seen the best minds of my generation destroyed by the 38th reading of “Knuffle Bunny Too.”"

When I was very young, working in my grandfather’s corner grocery in West Virginia, I would sneak on top of the giant freezers and hide so I could watch folks come in and out, listening to what they said, what they didn’t say, my grandfather at the register in his apron, smoking, or in the back making ‘hamburg’ from an entire side of beef. (After breaking down the cow, cleaver in hand, he’d flex his biceps and dare me to hang off of it.) I remember feeling like everything I was watching was operatic somehow. Like I was privy to secrets. I knew even then that if I kept quiet and paid attention, my world would be filled with stories. That this suggestion of boundless possibility happened in a tar-strip-road factory town was an additional gift. Stories that count are everywhere, all the time. Beauty too.”"

The answer is obvious; the challenge, however, is actually achieving a flawless, even-toned face that looks completely natural. Want Ryoke’s advice? Put down the foundation brush, forget about using your fingertips and opt for her favorite skin-perfecting tool: the Beautyblender cosmetic sponge. Designed to be used in a dabbing motion, “It gives you the effect of actual skin texture, so it amazingly looks like you’re not wearing anything,” she says. In addition, its rounded egg-shape allows you to blend makeup without leaving behind a single streak. For the Costello Tagliapietra runway show yesterday, Ryoke gave the models’ faces a slightly dewy finish by first wetting the sponge with mineral water. “I’m quite lazy, and the sponge does all the work,” she says with a laugh."

A pamphlet explaining the group’s creed said members were “not afraid to get our hands dirty,” according to The Los Angeles Times, which first reported on the group’s existence. The seven deputies were removed from duty with pay last year, officials said. "

"The Enlightenment’s ‘Race’ Problem, and Ours",2013-02-11,article,News,,"['Discrimination', 'Philosophy', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Slavery']","When we learned that witches did not exist, we threw out the category. So why do we cling to the discredited notion of race?","In 1734, Anton Wilhelm Amo, a West African student and former chamber slave of Duke Anton Ulrich of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, defended a philosophy dissertation at the University of Halle in Saxony, written in Latin and entitled “On the Impassivity of the Human Mind.” A dedicatory letter was appended from the rector of the University of Wittenberg, Johannes Gottfried Kraus, who praised “the natural genius” of Africa, its “appreciation for learning,” and its “inestimable contribution to the knowledge of human affairs” and of “divine things.” Kraus placed Amo in a lineage that includes many North African Latin authors of antiquity, such as Terence, Tertullian and St. Augustine.In the following decade, the Scottish philosopher David Hume would write: “I am apt to suspect the Negroes, and in general all other species of men to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was any civilized nation of any other complection than white, nor even any individual eminent in action or speculation.”Hume had not heard of Amo, that much is clear. But we can also detect a tremendous difference between Hume’s understanding of human capacities and that of Kraus: the author of Amo’s dedicatory letter doesn’t even consider the possibility of anchoring what individual human beings are capable of doing to something as arbitrary as “complection.” For Kraus, Amo represents a continent and its long and distinguished history; he does not represent a “race.”"

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: “Is ‘Shame’ the name of something Brandon does feel, or of something the filmmakers think he should feel? The movie, for all its displays of honesty (which is to say nudity), is also curiously coy. It presents Brandon for our titillation, our disapproval and perhaps our envy, but denies him access to our sympathy. I know, that’s the point, that Mr. McQueen wants to show how the intensity of Brandon’s need shuts him off from real intimacy, but this seems to be a foregone conclusion, the result of an elegant experiment that was rigged from the start.”"

The Pope Abdicates,2013-02-11,article,News,,[],The implications of Benedict’s resignation.,"During his pontificate and the years of influence that preceded it, Benedict XVI was often stereotyped as an arch-traditionalist, but his next-to-unprecedented decision to abdicate the papal throne may be one of the most striking concessions to modernity a recent pope has made. His statement of resignation basically acknowledges as much, citing the realities of “today’s world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith” as a particular reason why greater “strength of mind and body” than he now possesses is required of the successor to Saint Peter. These lines are an implicit nod not only to the particular challenges facing his pontificate, but also to the vast changes that mass media and global travel have wrought in the papacy’s role. Now that “globetrotting face of Catholicism” and “media-savvy C.E.O. of a controversial brand” have been added to the theological and administrative obligations inherent in the office, the burdens of age are arguably more of an impediment to papal effectiveness than ever before, and the mix of stasis and confusion created by a pontiff’s slow decline can have more immediately disastrous effects than they might have had in an era when papal incapacity could be a Roman secret rather than a global spectacle."

Jane’s World,2013-02-15,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],Paula Byrne’s biography uses everyday objects to explore influences on Austen’s work.,"“And, after all, we have lives enough of Jane Austen.” This verdict, delivered by Virginia Woolf at Cambridge in 1928, should give any Austen biographer pause. Yet Austen’s appeal has proved irresistible. Since Woolf’s pronouncement, countless editions, studies and adaptations of her novels have appeared. Her 160 extant letters have been frequently collected, most notably by R. W. Chapman (in 1932 and 1952) and by the mother of all Janeites, Deirdre Le Faye (in 1995 and 2011). Recent biographies similarly abound, varying in aim and quality: Lord David Cecil’s elegant and unassuming “portrait” in 1978; Park Honan’s scrupulous ­“cradle-to-grave” history in 1987; Claire Tomalin’s brisk, superlative “life” and David Nokes’s lengthier, more imaginative account, both in 1997.

Like several of Brink’s historical novels, “Philida” probes South Africa’s more distant sordid past, animating real figures from the Cape Colony’s days of white settlement, when the enslavement and indentured servitude of local black and indigenous populations, as well as people brought over from the Dutch East Indies, were entirely routine.

It can’t be reduced to its technical components, whatever they are. It’s metaphysical, yet without fixed or transcendent meaning. It’s a crystal ball, without any clairvoyance. Who hasn’t arrived at the logically borne-out if senseless belief that in the oceanic swell of Google lies hidden the answer to one’s most private problem? In his latest book, “Four New Messages,” Joshua Cohen takes on the experiential properties of the “online” modality, its textures and tautologies, its effects on language and thus on humans and meaning. This seems at once a fundamental and ambitious place to begin mapping this void of a thing that we pretend, by not writing about it in literature, doesn’t have much place in life, when the dirty truth is otherwise."

The Associated Press quoted Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi as saying the export ban would last for six months. But it was unclear whether the move, which he announced Friday, would reduce domestic prices, particularly in time for Nowruz, the coming New Year holiday when pistachios are in especially high demand. It was also unclear to what extent the higher price reflected the declining value of the rial, Iran’s currency, which has been weakened by the effects of Western sanctions and what critics call the government’s economic mismanagement. The chairman of Iran’s chamber of exports, Asadollah Asgaroladi, was quoted by the Fars News Agency as calling the export moratorium a mistake that would do little to ease the price and probably cost Iran more than $500 million in lost export revenue. He was also quoted as saying the ban would only strengthen the competitiveness of pistachios from the United States, which surpassed Iran in total pistachio production last year."

Oscar Pistorius has single-handedly shown why this type of thinking is misguided (I’m being kind). In his second court appearance since being charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, Pistorius explained in an affidavit why he shot her four times through his closed bathroom door. He thought an intruder had come in through the bathroom window – so of course he opened fire without so much as switching on a light. So there are two possibilities: the police version, which is that he murdered her in cold blood after a violent argument, or the Pistorius version, which is that it was a regrettable accident. Either way, if there was no gun in the house, Steenkamp would still be alive. By the way, did you know he tweeted in November, “Nothing like getting home to hear the washing machine on and thinking its an intruder to go into full combat recon mode into the pantry! waa.” Wayne LaPierre should testify in his defense."

Although the percentage of TV viewers who rely on the Internet exclusively is negligible, television executives are concerned that many consumers are being missed regularly. Most Internet viewings of TV shows are not counted in Nielsen’s ratings because they are shown without commercials or with different commercials than when they aired on television — and new streaming services, like Aereo and one in the works from Intel, stream shows and ads without cable. The expanded ratings will allow executives to count customers that these types of services may steal away from cable."

Not only do they shut themselves off from family in what the novelist Jamaica Kincaid calls “the infernal room” from which their stories come, but, worse still, those stories are quite likely to deal one day with the dreams, terrors, tics and moral lapses of their loved ones. There’s a reflex in every writer that trumps even the maternal instinct, a part of her that, even while her newborn suckles at her breast, is cold-eyed, choosing words to describe the pit-bull clamp of its gums, the crusted globe of its skull, with the same dispassion with which she might describe fellow passengers on a bus."

As James Lasdun discovers in this smart, rigorous and beautifully written memoir about being on the unwelcome end of someone else’s attention, it’s not always easy to determine that precise moment when the already peculiar relationship between a creative writing student and a teacher starts to go horribly wrong.

That sea — wide, deep and often treacherous — is what remains of the British Empire for historians to trawl, though few attempt to chart the whole of it in one relatively compact volume. Darwin managed something similar with his previous books “The Empire Project: The Rise and Fall of the British World-System, 1830-1970” and “After Tamerlane: The Global History of Empire Since 1405” — emerging from the imperial brine with poise and balance where lesser historians would have beached themselves like lost whales or glugged down to the depths, tangled in the tentacles of a giant squid. In “Unfinished Empire,” he turns his attention to the British Empire’s why, who and how: small words that signify very big questions."
The Awakening,2013-02-22,article,Review,,['Books and Literature'],"In Will Self’s neo-modernist novel, a woman who has languished for decades in a mental hospital is briefly revived from oblivion.","“Umbrella” takes its title and epigraph from Joyce’s “Ulys­ses”: “A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.” Umbrellas do play bit parts in Will Self’s ambitious new novel, but they also echo the fates of its characters, themselves bit players in the vast, indifferent dramas that dominate modern British life. Impersonal bureaucracies and brutal industrial processes serve less as backdrops than as the central obsessions of the book, which moves us through the munitions factories and killing fields of World War I, a psychiatric hospital and a creepily gentrified modern London where those who can’t afford exorbitant rents are ruthlessly pushed out. In this world, people are as disposable as umbrellas, which are “never contracted for, only mysteriously acquired, to be fleetingly useful, then annoying and cumbersome before eventually being lost.” "

She grew up in Nazi Germany, fled her home at the end of the war and was rescued from starvation by the Soviet Army. In Communist East Germany, she bravely chronicled life under a dictatorship in novels like “Divided Heaven” and “The Quest for Christa T,” acts of nuanced dissent that earned her surveillance by the secret police, the Stasi. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, she welcomed the collapse of the Communist government.

Some Tunisians fault Mr. Laarayedh, the interior minister, for failing to protect the assassinated opposition leader, Chokri Belaid, or to apprehend his killers. Mr. Laarayehd endured more than a decade of imprisonment and torture under Tunisia’s former dictator. He is considered among the least conservative members of his party, which is less conservative than most other Islamist parties in the region. President Moncef Marzouki has asked him to form a cabinet. It must be submitted for final approval by the constituent assembly, where the Islamists hold a plurality but not the majority of the seats."
Russia: Foreign Assets Bill Advances,2013-02-23,article,Brief,,"['Legislatures and Parliaments', 'Corruption (Institutional)', 'Law and Legislation', 'Banking and Financial Institutions']","The lower house of Parliament voted for a bill to bar government officials from holding bank accounts outside of Russia, signaling that the measure may win final approval."," The lower house of Parliament on Friday voted overwhelmingly for a bill to bar government officials from holding bank accounts or stocks outside of Russia, signaling that the measure is likely to win final approval. The vote, the first of three required to send the bill to the upper chamber, was 443 to 0. The bill was proposed by President Vladimir V. Putin, and supporters say it will help combat corruption. Critics say that the measure contains numerous loopholes and that rather than preventing officials from owning foreign assets, it will simply promote efforts to hide them. Efforts to regulate or scrutinize the assets of Russian officials have led to the resignations of several lawmakers, including a member of the majority party United Russia who had not disclosed that he owned an apartment worth nearly $1.3 million in Miami.

What’s on Saturday,2013-02-23,article,Schedule,,[],Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (ABC) DREAMGIRLS (2006) Three Detroit singers, portrayed, above from left, by Anika Noni Rose, Beyoncé Knowles and Jennifer Hudson, discover the price of fame in Bill Condon’s adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same title. Jamie Foxx plays the musical entrepreneur who trades in Effie White (Ms. Hudson, in her Oscar-winning role), the lead singer of the Dreamettes, for her thinner, lighter-skinned sidekick, Deena Jones (Ms. Knowles). Eddie Murphy won an Oscar nomination for his turn as James (Thunder) Early, a soul man loosely based on James Brown. The film’s dramatic and musical peak — “the showstopper, the main reason to see the movie” — comes midpoint when Ms. Hudson sings “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “That song has been this musical’s calling card since the first Broadway production 25 years ago, but to see Ms. Hudson tear into it on screen nonetheless brings the goose-bumped thrill of witnessing something new, even historic.” Nevertheless, he wrote, “the music has the effect of compromising one of the crucial ambitions of the film: to refract the recent history of black America (and, by implication, America itself) through the prism of popular culture.”"

"Less Innovation, More Inequality",2013-02-25,article,News,,"['Labor and Jobs', 'Productivity', 'United States Economy', 'Wages and Salaries']",America’s peak years of indigenous innovation ran from the 1820s to the 1960s. A slowdown in dynamism since then has contributed to soaring inequality.,"ONE source of the outsize inequalities in America is the dynamism that made economic activity so rewarding. An economy open to new concepts and novel ventures is bound to generate unequal gains. To tax all of those gains would close off the prospects for success that many entrepreneurs need if they are to undertake ambitious ventures — a big mistake. But it would also be a mistake to misunderstand the relation of inequality and innovation. It is less innovation — not more — that has widened inequality in the United States in recent decades.America’s peak years of indigenous innovation ran from the 1820s to the 1960s. There were a few financial panics and two depressions, to be sure. But in this period, a frenzy of creative activity, economic competition and rapid growth in national income provided widening economic inclusion, rising wages for all and engaging careers for most. Innovations gave workers better tools to work with and better products to make, thus lifting their wages. Then this innovation began to retreat, most of it to an area of land along the West Coast. In the early 1970s the rate of indigenous innovation (as measured by its estimated contribution to the rate of growth in labor productivity) dropped by about half — to around 1 percent since then, from about 2 percent before then."

A frisky yet sensible tone pervades the book, from the author’s dedication (to her family, “for eating all their veggies”) to the Mouth-watering Cilantro Lime Martini recipe at the end."

The Magical Realism of Norwegian Nights,2013-02-28,article,News,,"['Aurora Borealis', 'Travel and Vacations']",How the Arctic light delineates the world.,"It was in the late ’80s that I saw the northern lights for the first time. I was 18 and had moved to an island in the far north of Norway to take a job as a teacher in a little school in one of the small villages up there. The village was located in the shadow of a steep, barren mountain chain, looking out on the Atlantic Ocean. Fewer than 300 people lived there, and almost all of them were involved in fishing, either as fishermen on small vessels, or as workers in the fish warehouse. It was an exposed place. One night a roof was ripped off and a camping trailer was overturned by high winds; some of the buildings had been fastened to guy wires. Everything came from the sea: the wind, the clouds, the rain, the waves and the fish, which were at the center of village life. Few of the houses had gardens; there was no buffer between civilization and nature. When you opened the door, it felt as if you were stepping out into nature, and that left its mark on the people who lived there. The social life was different from what I was used to; it was more raw and much more direct, but also warmer and more inclusive. Maybe because that’s all there was — a few clusters of buildings near the sea — and those who lived there were dependent on one another. A decade later I wrote a novel set in that place, and what stayed with me — aside from the odd social reality, in which, after only a few days, I became mercilessly entangled — what settled as a memory in my body was the light."

The Brutal Years,2013-02-28,article,Review,,"['Books and Literature', 'Bullies']","In “Sticks and Stones,” Emily Bazelon charts the experiences of a few bullied children and synthesizes the scholarship on how to contain or prevent such harm.","The question of whether humans are becoming more brutal or more civilized has been debated urgently by the Athenians, the philosophers of the Renaissance, the Victorians and the existentialists. Those who argue that cruelty is currently becoming more acute point to the Rwandan genocide, global warming, and the malicious acts of selfish corporations and corrupt politicians. Contrariwise, others point to a safer and kinder society of greater prosperity and less prejudice against social, religious and ethnic minorities; Steven Pinker’s 2011 book, “The Better Angels of Our Nature,” proposes that we live more peaceably now than ever before. The dichotomous argument has particular resonance in the context of childhood. Teachers no longer routinely hit students; laws require accommodations for young people with learning disabilities; parents keep watch for teachers’ abuse and vice versa; developmental therapists are around every corner. Yet the Internet has unleashed meanness of a previously unimagined scope and celerity; broken households escalate children’s proclivity to launch unmonitored assaults on weaker kids; ethics are preached neither at home nor at school; and the accessibility of assault rifles enables nearly apocalyptic juvenile excess. Adult bullies from talk radio to Congress get constant airtime, and in many quarters their belligerence is applauded. Still, we are shocked when children behave belligerently toward one another. Youthful aggression has always been a problem and always will be; the pitilessness of childhood, like that of the world, is most likely a constant quantity."

Good haunted-house movies should fill you with a sense of looming dread about homes and their nightmares, as in Edgar Allan Poe’s landmark story “The Fall of the House of Usher.” By contrast “The Condemned” is uncanny only in its resemblance to a television soap, with acting as flat as the lighting and scenes that end with the kind of cliffhanger moments that otherwise announce commercial breaks."

That may change, at least temporarily, when its big show “Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney” opens on May 10. Mr. Barney, an artist with a cultlike following, produces films and videos, most of which he performs in. He also makes sculptures and objects, as well as photographs, books and installations derived from the films. He fashions his sculptures out of unusual materials like tapioca (dumbbells) and petroleum jelly (a weight bench). His drawings are the least known of his works. But to a place like the Morgan they are also the most intriguing."

A Mighty Beanstalk Grows a New Twist,2013-02-28,article,Review,,['Movies'],"“Jack the Giant Slayer” sticks with the familiar bedtime story, embellishing it with 3-D and other effects, noisy battles and an occasional wink at the material.","Recently filmmakers have been dusting off fairy tales and giving them a revisionist feminist spin. As movies like “Red Riding Hood” and “Mirror Mirror” suggest, striking a balance between the old (and often sexist) and the new (and vaguely progressive) is trickier than it might seem. The makers of “Snow White and the Huntsman” tried to reconcile two potentially irreconcilable ideas — a thoroughly modern miss and an old-fashioned happily ever after — by putting a sword in Snow White’s hands so she could ride alongside her heroic hunk. The results weren’t half bad, even if this butched-up Snow White didn’t magically transform into a genuinely liberated princess. "

The misleading word would be “about.” The film, by Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel, is a work of nonfiction set entirely on a groundfish trawler out of New Bedford, Mass., but it avoids the standard equipment of interviews, analysis and explanation.
