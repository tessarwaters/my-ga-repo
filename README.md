Welcome to my work from my time as a student in the General Assembly part-time data science course! 

The GA data science course is a project based Python training program that focuses on statistics, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. Projects include: 

1) Capstone Project: Predicting clean energy ETF (iShares Global Clean Energy ETF) activity based on climate change related media (The New York Times) coverage. Skills: extracting API data; Natural Language Processing; topic modeling (non-negative matrix factorization; latent dirichlet allocation); time series forecasting (SARIMAX). SEE Final_Project folder. 
2) Bikeshare Sales + Linear Regression. Skills: linear models to predict sales; cross-validation to evaluate model performance. SEE GA HW 1 and 2 folder (HW2). 
3) Analyzing IMDb Data. Skills: exploratory data analysis and visualization. SEE GA HW 1 and 2 folder (project-eda-imdb). 

Course topics: linear regression models; decision trees; classification models (logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors); neural networks; web scraping.
